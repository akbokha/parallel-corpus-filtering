it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg m@@ elt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to take ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thinking and hus@@ ks , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and madness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a mental illness , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods abnormal high mood ) alter@@ nat@@ ely alter@@ nating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy will be applied for the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes and prevention of severe episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution will be applied to fast control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to take or the melting pot in patients may be applied to those swal@@ lowing tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be disman@@ tled , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters work to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schizophrenia and bi@@ polarity plays a role to norm@@ alize Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its re @-@ occur will be prevented .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were increased in increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been compared to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have re @-@ occur to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that in increased anxiety , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients was examined by a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies through to investigate how the body assimil@@ ates the melting away and the solution to assimil@@ ation ( up ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received an bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significant reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received a placebo .
in applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies varied symptoms are more effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented more effective up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ emergence man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , gra@@ ding ( lam@@ ination ) , gra@@ dation ( nausea ) , gra@@ vation ( nausea ) , ob@@ struction ( increased saliva ) , ti@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( increased saliva ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ ni@@ ousness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ means ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes discussed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee reached the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission shared the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day every day independently of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combin@@ ation therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
having regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ ald@@ osis should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is set from the combin@@ ation therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide @-@ based behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disrup@@ tions and was reported in some cases after the beginning or a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ologic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of addiction with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ g or isch@@ a@@ emia disease , conditions that are pre@@ disp@@ osed of hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ stream medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ignant form ) .

if at one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late neo@@ dy@@ in@@ esia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms developed to a m@@ ns or not a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , have to be set .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amp@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are connected with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased Ster@@ ber@@ isi@@ ko compared to the placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for undes@@ er@@ ge@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar com@@ a or death , was reported in patients treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .

a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , where weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with itself over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resistance rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy promot@@ ers increased a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) the Au@@ c of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ max was unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and that is why similar doses should be made .

if you are considering the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and that is why similar doses should be made .
after completion of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the tin levels before the start of the companion therapy .
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ al concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day does not have any significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ tom@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies at animal health , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential risks justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk to fet@@ us .
however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned before , dangerous machines , including vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .

the efficacy of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in omni@@ present administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ sive patients treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients received conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el
if one regards only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between drugs and the deterioration of disease indicators in relation to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that abra@@ sion was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el in pharmaceuticals .
it may also be applied to patients who are relie@@ ved or before the start of the treatment of low Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ pay in the blood .
the drug regulatory framework ( CH@@ MP ) found that abra@@ sion among patients , in which the first treatment was no longer propos@@ ing , effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , drugs , and that it must not be given to other medicines in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
January 2008 was issued by the European Commission ( Bio@@ Science Limited ) as a approval for the transfer of my@@ x@@ ane in the whole of the European Union .
my@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and is not displayed for standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ path@@ y during the my@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced in the following series on 220 mg / m2 .
in sensor@@ ic neuro@@ path@@ y degree 3 is the treatment dis@@ rupt , until an improvement to degree 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies conducted with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dos@@ is@@ ations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
my@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ certainties and effectiveness .
my@@ x@@ ane is a album @-@ bound@@ ed nan@@ op@@ articles form@@ ulate of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately disman@@ tled and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients there should be no new my@@ x@@ ane treatment for cycles until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ count increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the Th@@ ro@@ prac@@ tic number has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
while one clearly has been detected with my@@ x@@ ane in relation to the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ale incidents in the inde@@ xed patient collective is not uncommon , especially in patients with younger anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if in the patient after the gift of my@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ lever and contra@@ sting means .
my@@ x@@ ane should not practise at pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age that practice no effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoidable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ eption method .
male patients who are treated with my@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment do not give a child .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm con@@ formity , since through therapy with abra@@ sion , the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility exists .
my@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) that can affect the mode of traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side @-@ effects performed at 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated at the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( compared to 79 % of the patients ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ sive patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in Table 1 are the side effects performed in conjunction with the gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made from the patient or his supervis@@ ors , provided that they have received adequate guidance .
patients with chronic kidney failure / or patients who received chemotherapy should always be included in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per week in adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive any chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by the fact that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s body .
Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin will also be used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus prevent the effects of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with filing as an injection in a V@@ ene as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference practitioner .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were either re@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ aries between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also yiel@@ ded the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin have been examined by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ al values of patients were killed in the same degree as for those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the com@@ mon@@ est side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ os@@ opathy ( brain problems ) , such as sudden , ste@@ aling @-@ like head@@ ache and turbul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , since further studies are needed to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ means ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine has been shown in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with which the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ ar concentration should lie between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ences may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical process and the disease is necessary by the doctor .
an increase in the hem@@ or@@ der@@ in to more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , can occasionally be observed with a patient &apos;s individual hem@@ ost@@ ar values or under the hem@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
given this ha@@ vo@@ ari@@ ability value should be tried over an appropriate dose management , the Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / d@@ l ( 6.@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ ophi@@ le value is increased by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or when the permanent Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ value 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is transc@@ ending , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is to reduce 25 % .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high degree of risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including those who have recently suffered a reduced h@@ ind quarry , as in the case of patients ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
additionally , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get will take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta , which occur in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta the same is as in Zom@@ eta , a portion of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women involved were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of ver@@ teb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study comprised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to have suffered over 50 years , recently examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme which builds bone substance ) in the blood by at least 75 % against the initial value .
in the study involving older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures among patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures had 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fusion .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s risk of kidney disease , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ men ( re@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors to pres@@ cribe the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients in which the drug @-@ effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission appointed Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited issued a permit for launching Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in case of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended once a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic figure , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should Ac@@ la@@ sta be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long r@@ emission period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent @-@ lap@@ id@@ able hip frac@@ ture , an Initi@@ al dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , i.e. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 because data is missing for un@@ certainties and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since this patient population has only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is before the start of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta in sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick setup of the effect of Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cr@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be replaced before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a tooth examination with appropriate pre @-@ ventil@@ ated dental treatment .
for patients who need dental access , no data is available if the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .

in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted pharmaceutical effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , associated with .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( annually prior to the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a reduced renal function , were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of Gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal tail range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated by Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures , following a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures , after a recent lap@@ se survey , the majority of patients were not rout@@ inely measured , however the majority of patients received an initi@@ ald@@ osis vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ im area occasionally became , mainly on cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( pri@@ mor@@ r in the max@@ im area ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including customs acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 @-@ treated patients treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be maintained with 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age . 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multi@@ f@@ use 5 and 15 minutes of constant in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ o@@ cular data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ tically independent .
after that , the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel quickly took from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the highest value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ onic disappearance of the great cycle with half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ € 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a season Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
the early stages phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid decline in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ ation over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the termination of customs clear@@ ance - concentration around 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against Time ) .
a diminished Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous substances is impro@@ bable , because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans , and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible , nitrogen @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The renal clearing of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid corro@@ bor@@ ated with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was compared with the 64 studied patients in the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder until a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment to the Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
however , there is only limited data for heavy renal dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ) Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data for this population .
acute toxicity The highest not let@@ tering intraven@@ ous single dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , lon@@ eliness of 1.@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the Au@@ c the 6@@ ple of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a renal glands .
sub@@ chron@@ ic and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been administered in 3 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ minute intervals , administered at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , related to the Au@@ c , corresponds to the Au@@ c , corresponds to ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeat@@ ed@@ ulated Ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended Human exposure sufficiently , the toxic@@ ological effects occurred among other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common cause in studies with repeated application was a multip@@ ly primary spontane@@ ity in the metap@@ hysi@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all doses , a refund which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ resor@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats , one watched a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with dos@@ ages of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) abnorm@@ alities and such of skel@@ eton .

Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ent class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ck .
decreasing blood levels of sexual hormones , mainly o@@ estrogen , which are made from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men .
when Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material becomes un@@ ordered , what makes bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus gives the bones strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / apply and have recently been taken / used even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known to harm the kidneys .
on application of Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drinks you are worried that you should take sufficient fluid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
if you have recently broken the hips , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hips .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can take Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration was missed by Ac@@ la@@ sta , set up immediately with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls , you are considering the c@@ ess@@ ation of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s notice and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very often on ( at more than 30 % of the patients ) , however , are less common after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle , or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it &apos;s unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , Nes@@ sel@@ ects and angi@@ o@@ des ( such as swelling at the face , the tongue , or in the throat ) , has been reported .
inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have considerably imp@@ aired or you notice adverse effects which are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for storage periods and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C .
patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture is advised to make in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the quick setup of the effect of Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at the bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cr@@ atic disease , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice a day of 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 is thus recommended or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Relations report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ ents ( CH@@ MP ) is described in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( Mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug medicine ( Du@@ al therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest remaining dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ic or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ vaccine or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better enco@@ ded and the blood sugar level is reduced , whereby type 2 diabetes is better adjusted .
for more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy has been studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ance , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar values have been reduced by using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ te study , the effect of the additional Gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ic in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values at 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 2@@ 89 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreasing sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ ac@@ id@@ osis ( high her@@ on mirror - sati@@ ety level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for launching Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently adjusted and with which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability is in@@ appropriate ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
to use Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain , and oils , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing macro@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased curing liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to the 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be insp@@ ected as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ cleared nausea , vom@@ iting , waiter @-@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , fatigue , appetite , appetite and / or darker har@@ n , are the liver enzymes .
the decision whether the patient treatment is continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be led up to the pres@@ et of laboratory parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven to stir up fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a tick , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one stood a minor reduction of the middle hem@@ ost@@ als ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ atology ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative @-@ controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients suffering from met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ at@@ glob@@ ins by 3.@@ 6 @-@ 4.@@ 1 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants and insulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ or@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitivity consists of patients who have pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale twin or three @-@ speed com@@ bin@@ ation therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ res@@ ine or as a branch of specialist therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch of the market , under the treatment of Thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ ul@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but war@@ ring doctors should report on the possibility of a bro@@ ul@@ ary when patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological evaluation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the expected frac@@ tures was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the women of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated to women and 1.@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years of examination of cardiovascular events , fac@@ tions were treated at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 0.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) with patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to do a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dis@@ continued ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ ology or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose level in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the result of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients below G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that blood sugar levels were just as strong as with another human resource .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied to patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ize ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is called the package age ) .
the Committee for Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ means ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of acet@@ one han@@ e weigh in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission appointed Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval for launching Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day when a rapid initi@@ alizing effect is desired along with a longer sustained effect .
the inj@@ ecting needle must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly , for example , by a growing insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ onic , long acting insulin ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage is required .
if the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e requires a dosage adjustment to the patient , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions emerged after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warnings of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia reported less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin .
before travelling that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travel may cause that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask for other medicines from them .

a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop stu@@ dent@@ ures : • Easy Mor@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have glucose , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar fruit juice . • sever@@ ity of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with consci@@ ences are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections ( 0.5 to 1.@@ 0 mg ) by an interven@@ ed assistant or by glucose that intraven@@ ously given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire activity is up to 24 hours .
resili@@ ence The resi@@ dual profile is based in it that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed resistance .
a series of gap ( hydro@@ ly@@ se@@ - ) places on the human insulin molecules have been considered , none of which is active by the division of educated metabol@@ ites .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ harm@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , to car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and to re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow special dangers to man .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission appointed Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval for the transfer of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the quantity of quick@@ ening insulin must be raised , then the quantity of the long acting insulin .
3 If necessary to switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in patients a dosage adjustment is required , it may be necessary for the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
before travelling that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such travel may cause that insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .

the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however , suggests that the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile is similar in children and young adults alike .

when the ur@@ inary ur@@ inary tract is still about 6 mg per week , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , toxicity can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor other medicines for prevention of gyp@@ sies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy were compared to different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with that of a placebo ( head@@ lamps ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hyper@@ uri@@ mia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary ur@@ inary organ was placed in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once every day 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) the patient under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients suffering from cardi@@ ac disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ Legal ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two Pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX ) and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three months of certain ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ oses age &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ at@@ in@@ ability at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX study showed in view of reducing the ser@@ um bags under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ur@@ inary tract to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in week 2 and maintained throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental incl@@ ine &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney failure , The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney failure ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage decline of the ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ centr@@ ations at Pro@@ ban@@ es , regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe renal function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ con@@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients required in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a g@@ lim@@ b ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the pl@@ aster size , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the pl@@ ough@@ s up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term distribution studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in the o@@ c increase , which is greater than the dose of dos@@ ages .
after taking simpler or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of ser@@ um @-@ acid re@@ concentration has been observed if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution Das apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l according to doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ tle of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent beyond the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are cr@@ ac@@ red ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a small vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inhal@@ ation of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lay down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs that are authorised in the European Union , the company has data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D mirror among patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than with those who only recorded Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE contained in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE contained exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( pu@@ gn@@ ans ) , ul@@ cers ( inf@@ erior stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic stri@@ ps .
in patients with et@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE must not be applied .
it must not be applied to diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low @-@ level calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or inhal@@ ation of drugs ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following critics are accurate to follow to reduce the risk of os@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE shall be swal@@ lowed up after the advent of the day just with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract excluding P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .

the doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms that should point out to possible pres@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions and patients should be pointed out at the appearance of symptom op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when lo@@ ping or retro@@ sp@@ ace@@ ous pain or new or become a li@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or it according to the occurrence of symptoms that would point to a solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all the clear@@ ance instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose by the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment was given primarily intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to give the notes whether the lowering of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients requiring an or@@ tho@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ card of jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor is authorit@@ ative for treatment planning on each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE the tablet the next morning after having noticed their failures .
they should not take two tablets on the same day but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the minerals ( like vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE as well .
alkal@@ ine foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral drugs can affect the resi@@ due of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , the patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ viewer studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical studies with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without that clin@@ ically relevant interactions appeared .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is intended only for application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable to apply for the pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no reference to directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

further Dos@@ is@@ ations can later be needed , as the phar@@ ma co@@ ar@@ cs of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the process of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transp@@ l@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ant treatment The oral Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be a transp@@ l@@ ant receiver from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of ad@@ sor@@ ra@@ f , so this shift in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after switching from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once daily has to begin the treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ ald@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to ad@@ sor@@ ra@@ f is a oral initi@@ ald@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning .

patients with reduced renal function Da kidney function has no influence on the Pharmac@@ ology of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potentials of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ pent@@ ine levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ solven@@ cy and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ ine on a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the talent level in the full blu@@ t The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of indul@@ gence and toler@@ ability in an individual case under the helpl@@ ess of full blu@@ t @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus talents during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f on ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the same application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ full @-@ blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the blood level is not exceed in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the talents are of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in ad@@ renal glands and hearty patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent treatment therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were generally used blood concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has resulted in serious undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ tation , or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ flow .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of wording or the regime should be made only under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which have been shown to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as re@@ frac@@ tory ones , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of ad@@ vag@@ aries .
for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ ts at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transp@@ l@@ actic recei@@ vers are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of ad@@ vag@@ aries .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain or other plant cures during a treatment with ad@@ vag@@ aries ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine concentrations in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was one as a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ y named chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy to observe , which can therefore also occur under ad@@ vag@@ aries .
further factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and o@@ estrogen .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to possible risk of mal@@ ignant skin changes due to appropriate clothes or use of a sun protection with a high protective factor .
if patients use the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered consciousness @-@ condition , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can enhance the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine blood levels at the simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain more concentrations in accordance with ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been with An@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms ( z ) .
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies made that the increase in blood levels primarily result from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal poison@@ ing .
high d@@ osing Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute dis@@ armament actions , can increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medications Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism can affect metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can descend the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormone exposure , making decisions about recep@@ tive actions are particularly cautious .
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may decrease the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can prolong their half times .
the results of a small number of studies in transp@@ l@@ ant patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there is an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended for any damaging effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ c@@ ali@@ ation of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , innate blood vessels ) .
dosage and frequency of application will apply to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood @-@ like problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Re@@ uel , similar , but it will be different , so that the medicine contains no proteins and animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated by the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood@@ sep@@ tic with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectively &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission appointed B@@ ax@@ ter AG to approve a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend upon the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the place and extent of the patient and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following case of here@@ tical events , the factor VIII activity shall not sink into the specified Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment process it becomes controlling the dose of the injections and the frequency of inj@@ ecting an appropriate determining factor VIII plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur @-@ long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis use in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 , i.e. from factor VIII per kg of body weight at the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or when the bleeding is not dominated by a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be replaced .
the administration rate is intended to address the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alisation antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always opposed to pro@@ mon@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator@@ ical activity of factor VIII and immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk factor within the first 20 expe@@ ditions is the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in previous patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 expe@@ ditions and am@@ nesty development , was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare asc@@ ending of the Hä@@ mop@@ hi@@ lie A in women about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
most of the patients encountered in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / $ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .

based on the data available since the first @-@ term data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be rated as positive , but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the base of the Safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s all 6 months , decided that the regulatory author@@ ship should apply for 5 years to request a further extension procedure .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited have officially adopted the Committee on Human Care ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company returns its application for approval for the approval of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and bases ) .
these are a type of virus that genetically modified so that there can be a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that it cannot produce copies of itself and can thus no infections in human beings .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been sup@@ pressed directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the not def@@ ective in the human body available p@@ 53 @-@ gene , is normally wearing to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ erous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company dates data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ building , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers given to the company , some questions were still un@@ solved .
based on the evaluation of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tumor benefits for patients .
the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the CH@@ MP did not take note of whether the withdrawal of the consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; com@@ b use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active ingredient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components are being released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by allergy to pol@@ len inflammation of the nose @-@ side@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ skin @-@ swelling ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and young adults aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ loop ( con@@ stit@@ ched nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be imp@@ aired by the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main changes were the changes of the heav@@ y@@ ness of the ha@@ y symptoms that were reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when contempl@@ ating all ha@@ y symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared with a decrease of the symptoms at 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ loop was considered , the patients showed relie@@ ving a relie@@ ving of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in patients who accepted des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( coron@@ ary ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ ic disease ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ infection ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ infection ( hyper@@ tension caused by a cerebral blood ) or have a risk for an ugly stroke of stro@@ kes .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transfer of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is whole to swal@@ low ( that is , without having to cr@@ ust or to ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because in long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can decrease in time .
after decrease the swelling of the loop in the upper breathing , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients infected with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ ic , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of these combin@@ ation therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested by patients with kidney or liver disorder , and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations on dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of hyper@@ tension or one T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or from Pal@@ pit@@ ations , coron@@ ary ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of headaches ) must be reduced .
for the treatment of following patient groups is advised to be treated : • patients with coron@@ ary ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dio @-@ attack in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder projection or bronze in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce the extent to its extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole has been administered additionally , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plastic concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests could not be significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and those treated with placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ estim@@ ation of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as Re@@ production studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin should be used in pregnancy .
patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , however , that in very rare cases , it may come to a ben@@ om@@ men@@ ness that can lead to an impair@@ ment of the modes of traffic or the ability to operate machines .
the symptoms may vary between a C@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially probable in children as well as dri@@ p in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pl@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ sti@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , Hau@@ ling , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ cl@@ onal cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single @-@ dose study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg does not affect standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected to flying .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has been found no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , an in@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for the Sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except nas@@ al @-@ skin @-@ swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin @-@ order , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ belonging patient groups no significant differences .
in the framework of a single dose study of the Pharmac@@ ology of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is shown in 30 minutes after administration in plasma .

as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ cular multi @-@ technical study , which has been performed with the formulation as tablet for healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ kers , has been determined that four pro@@ ban@@ des des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in poorly tolerated .
a components Inter@@ actions study reveals that exposure ( C@@ max and Au@@ c ) of Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin after the only gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine bio@@ equi@@ valence was equivalent to the exposure to the gift of a aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ harm@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive administration , to gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however does not allow special dangers to man .
the combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudo @-@ he@@ dr@@ ine .
in re@@ production @-@ sto@@ ic studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in the or@@ ical gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and an rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non ter@@ at@@ ogen .

one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ving the symptoms at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter @-@ compas@@ sion@@ ate allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should follow accordingly to the previous disease symptoms and can be termin@@ ated after the ring of symptoms and can be re @-@ recorded with their re @-@ emergence .
in the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) patients may be recommended to patients throughout the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets that were administered in addition to which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole are in addition administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the current intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , however , that in very rare cases it can come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities that can lead to an impair@@ ment of the modes of traffic or the ability to operate machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly seen side effects reported on the more frequently referred to than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ ths ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , which has been administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ple clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ cl@@ onal cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adolesc@@ ence P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multi@@ disciplinary , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dosage of 45 mg every day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ple of the clinical dose ) has been administered for over ten days , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks connected to flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , a@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , redness and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively less@@ ened the burden caused by seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine was investigated for further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simpler pro@@ spe@@ ktiv .
since the hist@@ amine is a primary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ultural diseases , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria is also leading in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of queu@@ es at the end of the first tin intervals .
as in other studies involving anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic urine , the minority of the patients who have not been re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka from the study .
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wa@@ its , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale in assessment of these variables .
in a phar@@ yn@@ o@@ cular study , in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s were comparable , in 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
the studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed pre@@ clinical studies , at a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quanti@@ t@@ ative differences with regard to the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ harm@@ ology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and re@@ productive ox@@ ic@@ ity can be recognized the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical studies and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in limited and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up with children between 2 and 11 years , the restricted metabolic rate , is identical to the children who use normal metabolic disease .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ osis and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suff@@ efficiency of this medicine does not take .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets that were administered in addition to which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or c@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were arranged in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the simultaneous effect of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
clinical studies involving adults and teenagers in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and juven@@ iles , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ple clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who were in question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine amount of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be ap@@ plau@@ d by adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the context of a clinical study with multi@@ specialist in adults and juven@@ iles , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ ple of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , did not prove the extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dosage was determined by 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical trials are not liable to any impair@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults it came from the simultaneous intake of alcohol either to a rein@@ forcement of the alcohol induc@@ ing performance com@@ promises nor to increase the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , a@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as kidney , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear , redness and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , reduce A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of queu@@ es at the end of the first tin intervals .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ o@@ cular activities have been observed in a phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study with the Sir@@ up@@ form@@ u@@ ction of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s who have limited met@@ aboli@@ ze .
the load ( Au@@ c ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with a season of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and juven@@ iles .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company has its application for approval for the transfer of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to protection against flu that is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a trunk of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ demic .
a influenza pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of flu @-@ virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man because people have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts of the flu @-@ virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
by doing so , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in contact with a flu @-@ virus of this gene@@ alogy .
subsequently the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ alien ) , pur@@ ged and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ demic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor .
for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP recommendations please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years involving human immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is the acquired immune system syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ men@@ ase is available as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the security of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ generations should only then be prescribed if the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines has previously taken , and the likelihood is that the virus is responding to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily to 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ generations depends upon the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not to heal , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ a has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , who previously had not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms .
this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ al last ) or change the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ently , after 48 weeks under A@@ generations , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children reduced A@@ generations also the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , treated by the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms , very few to the treatment .
in the study involving adults , which were treated earlier with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms , that increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicines A@@ generations the viral last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure@@ mer , it came under A@@ generations along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop in the Vir@@ al last after four weeks than in patients who recorded their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ former :
the most common side effects of A@@ generic ase ( observed at more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ generations may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ generations may also not be applied to patients who are cur@@ sing the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are in the same way as am@@ o@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other drugs against HIV , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ d@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( abor@@ tion of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that will be caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the European Glob@@ alisation Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ generations in use with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ generative ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee stated that the benefit of am@@ o@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ former , not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since the timing of scientific reasons only has limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the transport of A@@ generations throughout the European Union .
A@@ generative ase is combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) in adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usual , A@@ men@@ ase capsules are intended to be used for pharmac@@ o@@ cular boo@@ sts of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r along with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ men@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ st@@ ment ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a day @-@ highest dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ ology , efficacy and safety of A@@ generations in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ understanding of data about im@@ memorial and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ cular data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generative ase should not be given at the same time with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generations or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or any other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment of aging does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usual , A@@ men@@ ase capsules are intended to be used together with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially deadly disease .
for the event of a simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with previous limited liver function , including chronic hepatitis , increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which is confused via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ cino and sup@@ compression of the ad@@ renal function ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the absorption of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ generations with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the active resource concentration .
in patients suffering from these medicines at the same time , A@@ generations can be less effective because of decreased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility metabolic interactions with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information cannot be sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at the expense of symptoms of symptoms , especially if they are also administered for low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high risk of toxicity , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
A@@ men@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ ab@@ ic of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose treatment drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in case of ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms , reports are about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ham@@ mat@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or res@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ t@@ orial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ up@@ pression , higher Body measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ men were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width are not at the same time with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ ph@@ s 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width axi@@ al with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with drugs , whose active ingredients are predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and are linked to the increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side @-@ effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing an 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ ale development .
in the attempt to eradic@@ ate the lower plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel by a dose of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ ses ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already en@@ rolled cur@@ few are the spec@@ kled mirror and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and dis@@ appoint the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also u@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily are used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and imbalance of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % degra@@ ding when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained during the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a Do@@ si@@ erung@@ deposit for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring recommended , since the effectiveness and imbalance of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ cular study conducted on the application of A@@ generations in combination with Di@@ dan@@ zzo , but is recommended due to the in@@ viol@@ ate component of Di@@ dan@@ zzo , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ generations are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore with Gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with e@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ mer would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ini@@ mer and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may be sun@@ k .
if these medicines should be utilized at the same time , caution is advisable to be less effective since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical control is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( Au@@ c ) from Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in combination with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin associated side effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generations , will get to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this .
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ generations in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ ves of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max by K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ star ) at the 2,@@ 6@@ 9@@ 43 compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ inations avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with aging , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be directed to toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines when they are used in combination with aging .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sig@@ mer it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as A@@ generations , since it can come to resi@@ dual disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ sions known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r may lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ low pin , Ni@@ odi@@ ch@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ l@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ l@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ generations can increase their plastic concentration , and strengthen with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in relation to side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ an in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel rose significantly during the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol by approximately 86 % Moun@@ ted interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ generations with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of a treatment weighs up the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism can be strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are indicated by the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel with simultaneous administration of A@@ generations .
since Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ vement of this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ y , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
for this reason , A@@ generations cannot be applied together with oral gon@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same application of A@@ generations with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in the mi@@ le@@ as@@ per of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am to fold up the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at the expense of symptoms of symptoms , especially if they are also administered for low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historic comparisons , there can currently no recommendation be given as the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generations , a enhanced monitoring of IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ met@@ bot@@ ical effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predic@@ tible , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with current Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to a careful consideration of possible utility for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk trans@@ activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r moves to human milk .
a Re@@ production study on toler@@ able rats , which was administered at the U@@ ter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the lac@@ tation period , showed an diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the sur@@ rendering , including fer@@ til@@ isation and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ generations was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly to moderate , played early up and rarely led to the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ generic ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects are taken from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which cases were not subject to patients 1200 mg A@@ generic ase twice daily .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were standing by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study drug , and in more than 1 % of patients appeared , as well as under the treatment resul@@ tant ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and fa@@ eces fat tissues , multip@@ ly intra@@ o@@ cular and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( pin ) .
under 113 anti @-@ retro@@ viral not subject to persons who were treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine , over a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( p@@ airing ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - subject to patients under Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is for an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin envel@@ opes were usually slightly to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or res@@ dual opportun@@ ist infections ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with PI stipul@@ ated patients , the 600 mg of gener@@ ase twice daily together with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were kind and frequency of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values which were obtained from patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often appeared .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an infection ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies .

the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both at acc@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as at the peri@@ pher@@ al hem@@ at@@ y@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .
at Six@@ ten of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not subject to patients with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ESS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 obtained , joined a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure of up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ically could be studied .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the ins@@ ults of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ical failure within the 59 included , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms not subject to untreated patients , showed Res@@ cue patterns , which were similar to those in adults .

in the trial AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ cef@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) at patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ mut@@ ations on :
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical remains based analyses Gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the estimate of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ phy@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ using V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / L / M / V , I@@ 5@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 2@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , with a heigh@@ tened phenomenon of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased likelihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of Res@@ cue tests .
on Phen@@ otyp@@ ical remains based analyses Klin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interference systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the estimate of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies who distribute diagnostic tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( parti@@ tions ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a relief tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns generates a certain cru@@ ises against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross@@ resistance between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ inations , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on 25 @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not subject to patients with which a Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isolation ) .
vice versa , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early release of a de@@ ple@@ ted therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which may affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ generations in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lower chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ generations , at least another PI and at least a N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ embarrassment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ orable average change of output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ al last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ weight wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ exploited A@@ generations is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , from which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies ag@@ asy solution to take up and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it has been given no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients received a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered in treatment optim@@ isation with PI / Children of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration is the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ max on it by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % off the au@@ c , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake although the simultaneous intake influenced the extent and rate of Res@@ cue .
the seem@@ ing volume volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be used on a large amount of distribution as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ connected Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of uns@@ killed Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during the exchange rate in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss until C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or sub@@ str@@ ates a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ less than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generations solution and A@@ generative ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ grams .
also , the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected , therefore the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r will be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ ves comparable to those interested in healthy promot@@ ers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne@@ y@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas on me@@ tering with dos@@ ages ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , said .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ ocy@@ st cell aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet understood and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , out of the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data on people , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , however little notes for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gene testing , the bacterial @-@ core mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ omes , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was not mut@@ ed or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver disease can be monitored and detected in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ at@@ ase .
so far in clinical trials no significant liver disease has been observed in patients , either during the administration of A@@ generations yet to the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate as well as with the spec@@ ulative animals .
a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ dura , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and minor skel@@ etal changes that point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ men@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ st@@ ment ) , higher doses should be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ men@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a day @-@ highest dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with a more awake or slight liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the active resource concentration .
A@@ men@@ ase should be dropped in duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy became associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing an 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ ale development .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were obtained during the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a Do@@ si@@ erung@@ deposit for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , there will be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring recommended , since the effectiveness and imbalance of this combination is not known .
the treatment with e@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ep@@ mer would be low .
when these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical control is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ generations , will get to a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ block@@ ers like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ low pin , Ni@@ odi@@ ch@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ l@@ pin , Ni@@ odi@@ l@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days to Pro@@ ban@@ an in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel rose significantly during the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol by approximately 86 % Moun@@ ted interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ generations , a enhanced monitoring of IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of anti @-@ thro@@ met@@ bot@@ ical effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to an decrease of the Au@@ c and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % of the previous version .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to a careful consideration of possible utility for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a Re@@ production study on toler@@ able rats , which was administered at the U@@ ter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the lac@@ tation period , showed a diminished increase in the weight of the body weight .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ generations was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an infection ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies .
the anti @-@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both at acc@@ ut and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al hem@@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation in case of PI / children the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ o@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of uns@@ killed Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active component during the exchange rate in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss until C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines must indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bits the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or sub@@ str@@ ates a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neglected ; therefore , the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r will be low .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats , in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne@@ y@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas with dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ zel@@ ular Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet understood and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings in clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gene testing , the bacterial @-@ core mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ omes , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was not mut@@ ed or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate as well as with the spec@@ ulative animals .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles are not fully mature in juven@@ iles , so Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer ( PI ) in adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefits of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to stop was not occupied with PI and PI patients with PI untreated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % lower than by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with the intake of the solution to stop ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a day @-@ highest dose of 2@@ 800 mg of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since no dose @-@ recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patients can be avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ inations , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to participate in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of an toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ate is A@@ generations solution to take in children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a combination of the met@@ abol@@ ishing of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generations or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or any other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment of aging does not prevent the risk of 47 to transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the active resource concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk to a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy became associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug medium 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in case of ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ wor@@ ms , reports are about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous ham@@ mat@@ ome and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in is causing an 82 % reduction in the Au@@ c of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a res@@ ale development .
50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max , by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ generations can increase their plastic concentration , and with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
on the basis of the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to be reduced by Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am significantly higher plasma @-@ concentration of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk for man is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take up may not be applied to pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk trans@@ activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r moves to human milk .
a Re@@ production study on toler@@ able rats , which was administered at the U@@ ter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the lac@@ tation period , showed a diminished increase in the 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ generations was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of A@@ generic ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were observed - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations only rarely observed .

the applic@@ ability and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara are dependent on the treating disease : • At a maximum of 16 weeks , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . • With acute ker@@ at@@ ebo@@ x , it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment of treatment , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is cleaned before bed@@ time di@@ lution on the affected skin areas , so that they left enough long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara has been tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with full res@@ ignation of the hot@@ spots . • Al@@ dara has also been studied in two studies with small bas@@ al cell @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies , where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with full absorption of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara has also been tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ pants .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • In case of treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was the full cancellation rate combined with placebo @-@ treated patients . • The results of the two studies compared to Bas@@ al@@ cellular patients showed a complete waste rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to the patients treated with Al@@ dara patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk to severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin supplements have been observed , which have a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occur at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination which needed an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
in connection to the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream immediately following the treatment with other kut@@ an app@@ li@@ fied means for the treatment of extreme F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and periph@@ ery range , no clinical experience has so far been found .

data from an open clinical study point out that with large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of tin@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ pants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lips area within the lip of the lips .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of tin@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ ants to anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ al ker@@ at@@ osis on sub @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local skin actions frequently occur , but these reactions normally take back in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin actions are causing great discomfort or very strong , the treatment can be exposed for some days .
out of the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 batteries are showing a less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen control ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European medicines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will test all new information each year , which may be known to verify and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will be patient , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission shared the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. authorisation for approval by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ aries of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for long @-@ term enzymes for patients with reliable diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended as an appointment scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended as a dosage scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients can develop in@@ fu@@ sible reactions which are defined as any other side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be tigh@@ tly monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational environment for medical emergency cases .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients can form Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction , must be treated with caution in applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience is pre@@ matur@@ ely regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk @-@ reaction after having taken care of the treatment carefully .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ generative ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fu@@ sible reactions .
in the case of light or moderate @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment of anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be replaced and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ umed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the above reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular admission of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated compared to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to relie@@ ve during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
the adverse reactions in clinical studies were mainly en@@ rolled as in@@ fu@@ sible reactions that were at 53 % of the patients in Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted pharmaceutical interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase @-@ 3@@ - study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history appeared severe reactions , including bronze pas@@ m , respiratory and facial skin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children un@@ wished medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with mainly severe loss form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , with patients aged under 5 years with a serious publishing form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ejaculation from the study ) , between 13 / 45 patients were no objec@@ tion@@ able antibodies ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies before , among them 3 patients , in which it had never come to service .
patients with lack of low antibody levels were a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tern was a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed margin@@ al to low neutr@@ alising inhibit@@ ory effects on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ AG in the res@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug interactions , although the appearance of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the cum@@ ulative sub@@ strate and preventing further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is removed quickly from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were tested in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ ased phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study involving the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ e- test test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were treated to patients compared to the placebo group , improving lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability that are shown in the table below .
in the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as out of the table below .
the removal of the expected proc@@ al FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmon@@ ary volumes increased further proportional to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ eg@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a marked reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) has been fixed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease symptoms between patients who have been taken into account by using a combined end result , the clin@@ ically significant changes in cross @-@ age AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study where mainly the safety and phar@@ ma co@@ e@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in 20 patients ( 16 patients with the severe loss form and 4 with the middle @-@ making form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) have been determined by the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle @-@ level form , a normal mental stage speed , whereas in the older patients with severe loss form , were limited only or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , studies at the phar@@ ma @-@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ ke schem@@ ata have been carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly In@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ o@@ cular profile in patients aged under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies of safety sp@@ harm@@ ology , toxicity in uniform gift , toxicity in repeti@@ tive administration and re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data can be seen by no particular dangers for man .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not been removed from cancer ( drug against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the Gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition one &quot; anti @-@ master &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid lack ) .
in patients whose blood@@ stream changes or where certain other side effects should occur , the treatment should be up@@ loaded or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed increases the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer active period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ignant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ small lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with a@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the all administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
September 2004 , the European Commission appointed El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each mess bottle has to be checked with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ or S@@ IS is taken from the mess bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bronze sculpture according to previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to decrease the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift will be given as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses and intake must continue throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third Be@@ - Tre@@ at@@ ment cycle .
in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed received , prior to each gift , should be created a complete blood image - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thy@@ ro@@ id counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ PT ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount &lt; 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ check must take place under the t@@ ach@@ ute of the ton@@ ing of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the forec@@ ast@@ ed therapy .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ ost@@ ological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient is the value in front of the treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted if patients occur after 2 tin @-@ reductions a hem@@ ost@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ ost@@ asis toxicity degree 3 or 4 or so@@ - continued at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years old , there is an increased risk of secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ certainties and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min no Dos@@ is@@ ations necessary that go beyond the dosage customiz@@ ations recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however patients were evaluated with a liver functionality of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Border and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values from &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( near liver disease ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver breast cancer ) , not specifically studied in studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the level of Kno@@ x and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute Neut@@ ral number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ genic - cy@@ linders that have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ Number , Th@@ ro@@ prac@@ tic number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity , such as they were observed in previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxicity like neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was treated - if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ant on the patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to be used for reduction in @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ants ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is envis@@ aged , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with lengthy half @-@ time time for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ dominant hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ speed collection in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ inage of the ergometer is replaced before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardi@@ cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ar@@ rests , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ate vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an irreversible skull and reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment - gin@@ ine to get advice regarding the sperm production .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ istic ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ yl acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased pron@@ unciation with the result of a multip@@ lication of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid are applied in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
as no data is available with regard to interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of smell status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation Rati@@ o ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily - demanding and after careful consideration of the user for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since the possibility of an irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment plan , advice on the sper@@ mat@@ ing .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed enters the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the arti@@ ll@@ ery inf@@ ant can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Er@@ - held random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

patients who are taking all @-@ i and after 12 weeks do not have a weight loss , should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ists .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not disman@@ tle some fats in the food , thereby causing around a quarter of the fats which lead to the nour@@ ishes the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .

alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass @-@ Index ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fet@@ tered diet .
alli may not be used by children and young people under 18 , since not enough data are available for effectiveness and safety .
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ ved , with aging and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • pregnant time ( see Section 4.6 ) • E@@ simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likelihood of the appearance of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a low @-@ fat household or high @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction of diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic level must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take care as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional wa@@ vering measures in order to prevent the contrac@@ eption of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study of interactions between drugs and several cases with current use of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in became a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ ate , the Quick values ( international standard rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ ate , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ins were in norm@@ ality .
however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamin @-@ up ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a sing@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers that at the same time received a minor abor@@ tion of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ ate are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased gre@@ ase is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects that were established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a population .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli made in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract effects can lead .
single @-@ tro@@ users of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ wheel@@ oses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered for a period of 15 days to norm@@ al@@ ted important and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported by the market introduction of or@@ list@@ ate cases , either side effects or similar side effects as in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ ate were reported .
based on studies of humans and animals can be prec@@ eded from a rapid back@@ bone of systemic systemic effects that are due to the li@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effects continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and pan@@ atic le@@ pas@@ sers .
clinical studies has been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , increases the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food market .

the primary parameter , the variation of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of the study participants , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholesterol was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the most common side effects are related to the activity of capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body .
these side @-@ effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat share in the diet maybe not yet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutrition @-@ related companion phenomena : • Start some days , before the initial intake of capsules with a fet@@ ched diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the serv@@ ings that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you can exceed your fat limit . • Do not share your recommended fat in ev@@ enly on the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you have to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a low @-@ rich main meal or a relaxing night &apos;s weight , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these start @-@ iter@@ ations occur , learn to control these with time through adaptation of their diet .
• medicines for children to keep in@@ accessible . • You may not apply alli by default on the expiry date . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silic@@ on gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ pl@@ atin ) , and with chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti @-@ master ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , because among the effects in this age group is not enough information available .
this means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi studied in three main studies to 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy regim@@ ens received , which are strong or even trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
with chemotherapy regim@@ ens , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
with chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi were no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
when compared to Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki n Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer of cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy induced by adding one before the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
as Pal@@ on@@ osis tron the col@@ on @-@ days can prolong the col@@ on days , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ lingual I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable for simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ one interval prolon@@ gs or which tend to obtain such extension .
except in connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies inhi@@ bits Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron that is not directed against tum@@ ors of the five examined chemotherapy therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ yst@@ ine , Cy@@ clo@@ se@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ological interactions formed between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ es@@ - concentration or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ o@@ cular analysis was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ ex@@ z@@ ine , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron at human pregn@@ ancies lie not before , so Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in pregnant women should not be applied unless it is necessary from the treating doctor as necessary .
clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly stood with alo@@ xi in relation to headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest d@@ osing , similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events as in the other centres groups ; there were no dose treatment to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the great distribution of distribution , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in a alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were obtained a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; mg / m2 ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given on day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls are comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the in@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular channels and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in single @-@ pants from 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
reset After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initiate elimination of the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow elimination from the body with average termin@@ ally half times of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentrations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire tin range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , between day 1 and day 5 measured middle class ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ osis tron plasma Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ cular sim@@ ulations , the resulting intraven@@ ous form of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ osis tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days with the value of 0,@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ism , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ osis tron is less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ abol@@ ishing have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ ar C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron was found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as un@@ changing substance made some 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injection at healthy , the total body @-@ up was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver disorder the termin@@ ale elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron increases , however , a reduction in the dose is thus not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects have been observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficiently via the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a little relevance to the clinical use .
10 Of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies reported evidence that Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron is able to block only in very high concentrations of ions , who are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular determin@@ ants and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the action potential .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( every dose passed in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to men ) , which have been given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ated frequency of liver tum@@ ors , hyp@@ ophy@@ ae , pancre@@ as , pancre@@ as , car@@ ni@@ eces ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not on mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended to use human beings on a unique application , the relevance of these results are assessed as to humans .

June 2006 The Committee for Human@@ Legal Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , which approved the approval for the approval of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C approved by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injections .
this means that Alp@@ he@@ on is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pattern as an effective component already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Studies &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for treating adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection caused by liver infection ) .
with a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damage , and also the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic Essen@@ tial Amin@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) is increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on put data prior to the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , acting , safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference practitioner by 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment courses and 6 months after the treatment of treatment responded to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ surgery .
furthermore , concerns were expressed concerns that the data is not sufficient to the stability of the substance and market of the drug .
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial .
after hiring the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease in more patients than with the reference practitioner , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
aside from that , the test was conducted in the study to investigate the question of which the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ peti@@ tions ( one with cr@@ acking @-@ formation ) and small infected Laz@@ arus ( cr@@ iss@@ or or cutting ) , abra@@ sion and paraly@@ sed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven det@@ ectable or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ ack@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because alarm goes against these kinds of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial reefs ( the parts of the bacteria , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was rejected at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke on treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact : when the results of both studies were assembled at Hau@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ties , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke to treatment .
in these two studies , however , noticed that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused during the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vain ca@@ vities in the body tissue ) or from infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation in the order .
the Committee for Human@@ Legal Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh in short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections against the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ correctly small Laz@@ arus , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission issued the Gla@@ xo Group company Ltd . a permit for the transfer of Al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union .
patients , in which two or three days were no bet@@ tering , should once again be investigated and an aging therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ be carefully folded and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ox@@ icillin for@@ kli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , insufficient .
an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected point occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant Hem@@ orrho@@ ea is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 times a current gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ c ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ographic application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on un@@ restricted skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , can therefore not be deemed necessary when topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive ox@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal states / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should be used only during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to be preferred to the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / finished or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated , between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation at the administration resort that concerned about 1 % of the patients .

the actu@@ ator mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ or of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a certain relationship of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bond @-@ center protein L@@ 3 involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bind@@ ing center and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .

should be based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to at least some infection forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ox@@ icillin .
in the case of non @-@ interest to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , who are not im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is assured that the existing vaccination plan can be led by two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given to another hepatitis C or B vaccine .
vaccines have a function by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; as it can defend against a disease .
after a child has obtained the vaccine , the immune system recognises viruses and surface anti@@ gens , and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the previously approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the previously approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three doses existing vaccination schedule .
because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix included adult ingredients , some of the data used the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the share of the vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody @-@ centric one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain in the injection , redness , mat@@ iness ( ti@@ redness ) as well as friction .
Ambi@@ rix may be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) cannot be applied .
August 2002 shared the European Commission of the Company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals . a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix across the whole
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ed with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her can be desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate Mongo@@ lian vaccines or with a combin@@ ant simp@@ let@@ te .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C surface ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) -@@ antibody values are in the same proportions as after the vaccine with the respective mon@@ ov@@ als vaccines .
it is not yet completely secured , whether immun@@ ological individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her risk as protection , since they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory at no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injections , the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and supervision .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combin@@ ant simple , the 360 ELISA @-@ units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal impact success , these injections should be avoided .
however , with Th@@ ro@@ genic cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or cons@@ ular disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if ambi@@ rix in the second year in the form of a seper@@ ate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ular Poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ Tub@@ es vaccine was given , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study involving three vacc@@ inations of these formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ography , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the incidence observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses com@@ bos .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation base per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers observed , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the promot@@ ers after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant simple .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the promot@@ ers had given the Ambi@@ rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % with the Pro@@ ban@@ kers , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - combin@@ ant simp@@ let@@ te .
however , the incidence of mat@@ ology was comparable per pro@@ mill ( i.e. via the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers , which received ambient , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % with the promot@@ ers that received the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant simp@@ p ) .
the frequency of prec@@ urs@@ ors and matri@@ iness was low and comparable to that , which after administration of the compression simp@@ lier has been observed with the 3 @-@ c@@ anned vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of local interactions and general actions in the ambient group was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant simple hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ ing , however , according to vaccination with ambient , was a common occurrence of pain ( at the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per tape , reports .
the proportion of vaccines that have serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of ino@@ as with ambient or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis C surface , was not different statisti@@ cally .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for Anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were given a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 charged dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 charged dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant simp@@ p with three doses .
in the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ chni@@ cal rates were significantly higher in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ etry . it was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the table below .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambient or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month ino@@ cul@@ ema .
the immune response observed in this study was similar to that observed after vaccination by 3 doses with a combin@@ ant simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a tin volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be demonstrated that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccines is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month ino@@ cul@@ ema .

you can feel very tired , have a deep urine , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow search ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / Your Child are infected before the administration of both vaccines and hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child feel at the vaccination point not yet uncomfortable or sick / feels ) may not prevent a vaccination a disorder .
protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms that are similar to those according to Hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves with ju@@ ck@@ ling skin strikes , respiratory not or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have encountered an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has had a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually planned administration of the second vaccination ) .
if you have a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combination of hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased amount of effective components per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface area ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose , and would likely to give you a vaccination protection before the ino@@ cul@@ ation .
sometimes ambi@@ rix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s body / body or if you / your child hides a tick .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is .

but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficiently and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many as possible limbs .
if ambi@@ rix is given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ ers or nursing women are not administered apart , except it is imperative that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components from Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) in your child .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that have become known since the creation of the first approval for the input , it represented the CH@@ MP opinion that the beneficial risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since ambi@@ rix is limited only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be def@@ ective in patients aged over a month with in@@ comple@@ tt@@ em En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ astic encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ary concentration ) in pre @-@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is - split up on several individual cans to the meals - swal@@ lowed among the food mixed or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose to the stomach of the hose ) administered .
it was not a comparative study as am@@ mon@@ ds could not be compared to any other treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ don@@ tal medication that could be compared with no substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of loss , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , impotence , hydr@@ ation , flavors or taste sound , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasing body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ité ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle are effectively prevented from the ur@@ inary cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since due to the r@@ arity of the disease there was only limited information to this medicine at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous deficiency has already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ feste form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ kt , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life @-@ month ) there is an indication of use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ strous encephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip @-@ dys@@ functions , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by the prot@@ ein@@ ment of protein and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste deficiency at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine app@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase shortage must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered for patients with lo@@ op@@ tic disorders , as a risk for the emergence of o@@ car@@ ho@@ gan@@ y leaves , if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium pro 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , or severe kidney failure , as well as in case of sodium re@@ forming and o@@ de@@ hydr@@ ation levels .
since met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is carried out over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ A should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a heigh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left in the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they did not associate with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ ri@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ cr@@ um@@ y , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old small @-@ child with a lon@@ ged dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed at a intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is characterized by acet@@ ate with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is left over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both connections contain two nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis has been made early and the treatment immediately began to improve the survival chances and clinical results .
the prognosis of the early mani@@ feste form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ ring@@ ing , and the disease carried out itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ in@@ ous an@@ alogy within the first year of life .
through ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxi@@ di@@ ation ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ates , sodium and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rates of new borrowed from post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first year of life ) diagnosed with diseases to increase 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ och@@ ian encephal@@ opathy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time at many with intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ um form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ istor@@ ical bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ol@@ atro@@ tery and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , was the survival rates 98 % .
existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is interpreted in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ism in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ism was also investigated by cancers of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gesting plasma @-@ concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been observed .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ otic disorders or hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ os , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma is proven .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single cases ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ centr@@ ations in the Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had not been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children that have not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with gor@@ ge@@ al disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nose @-@ son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ feste deficiency at Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ im@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium pro 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ de@@ es were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ ri@@ azi@@ de , severe hypo@@ cr@@ um@@ y , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ path@@ y and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both connections contain two nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after in@@ gesting plasma @-@ concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been observed .
while the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this action the small measurement of 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measurement of 2.@@ 9 g and the big measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient must obtain the drug on a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they can ex@@ cre@@ ase the sti@@ ck@@ ering waste products that are not ex@@ crete following the intake of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you may use AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist when you take other medicines or have recently been taken if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation period , you should not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the medicine could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases also turbul@@ ence , headaches , tastes , flavors , after@@ no@@ bility , dessert , remin@@ ders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istical states were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , get in touch immediately with your doctor or with the note of your hospital in order to establish appropriate treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ ne@@ al syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ g ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that are sub@@ tract a PC@@ I , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion may continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PC@@ I .
approxim@@ ate 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all of some gift or combined with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ an II@@ IA / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination of heat ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PC@@ I the patients frequently became a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the ark ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or vas@@ cular arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PC@@ I was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for serious bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other deer or any of the other components .
it may not also be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a her@@ ical infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ité ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PC@@ I a acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the transfer of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ mid@@ - ST @-@ mid@@ market ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency stop or when an early intervention is scheduled .
the recommended initi@@ ald@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out in another row a PC@@ I should be given additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery on 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PC@@ I , according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PC@@ I consists of a initi@@ als intraven@@ ous form of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PC@@ I procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be done .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed by the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PC@@ I ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is administered by 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT test again 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PC@@ I study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ ations at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe renal cell ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous formation of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ at or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gift of molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• better hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ophi@@ lia and / or irreversible co@@ do@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients have been carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PC@@ I @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din occur most blood@@ lines to arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation , can undergo from patients who occur in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PC@@ I ) , while the treatment generally occur anywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking care of war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , the value of the IN@@ R leaderboard ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is re @-@ reached in front of the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or thy@@ ro@@ id aggreg@@ ators ) can be assumed that these active substances will increase the blood danger .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with the thy@@ ro@@ id aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al gland are regularly scrut@@ ini@@ zed in any case regularly .
the animal @-@ experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post @-@ post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group , as well as in those treated with He@@ par@@ in treated compar@@ atively , it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and T@@ IM@@ I measure for heavy bleeding , as defined in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ ant / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ ale , intra@@ o@@ cular bleeding or surgical intervention required , hem@@ at@@ ching of the hem@@ ophi@@ le @-@ level of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood circulation , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ alization that appeared among more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ y , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who undergo a PC@@ I .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group , as well as in those treated with He@@ par@@ in treated compar@@ atively , it was more common in women and in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ator group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organ@@ elles in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately disman@@ tled and the patient eng@@ ul@@ ties with regard to signs of a bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ wood inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the anim@@ on@@ en@@ bind@@ ings region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ mug@@ gled the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly improves the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .

for healthy promot@@ ers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dos@@ is@@ - and conc@@ entri@@ cular effect , which is eviden@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if the patient was carried out below a PC@@ I , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention on 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was given in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ ty Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or at PC@@ I .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risks , which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread ev@@ enly over the 3 treatment arms .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which need treatment with insulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra becomes sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm inj@@ ected or in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin is not effectively processed .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from human@@ ization , and the change means that it has a faster effect and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ization .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body can produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , in which the body can not be effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) has been observed when compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal .
Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components or in patients suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
September 2004 , the European Commission appointed San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for approval for the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall , the waiter @-@ angle , or the del@@ aying angle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdom@@ inal wall .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and diminished insulin delivery , insulin can be cut down in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of manufacturing can be a change in insulin delivery .
3 A insufficient dosage or the demo@@ li@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic c@@ eto@@ ac@@ dose ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of one patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be made under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the work profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that can increase the blood@@ shed activity and ampli@@ fy the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics include or@@ ale anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ di@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ s , S@@ ali@@ zy@@ l@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ lon@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine may be the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ ders regulation , or are missing .
animal experimental studies on Re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between inflation and human rights in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin @-@ milk enters into human mother &apos;s milk , but generally insulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ ved after oral application .

Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy U@@ d neglect to change the injections within the injection area , can occur in a result of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy in the injections .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with consci@@ ess@@ ness can be treated by means of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections ( 0.5 @-@ 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a Glu@@ k@@ agon@@ ally , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be occurs faster in the efficiency of insulin and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em standard .
in a study involving 18 male people at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin showed insulin range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg for a dose of dis@@ proportionate effect , and with 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate rise of glu@@ cos@@ y effect , just like human@@ ize .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast as normal human@@ ization and achie@@ ves the full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human .
from the data was evident that in an application of insulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal weight , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin was done in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ ran@@ ational control was achieved as having a human normal weight , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is achieved in 15 minutes after the meal starts , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is given like with human normal , which is 2 mixed @-@ nu@@ des before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal in comparison to human normal weight , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the meal was given ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal weight , 2 minutes ( normally - before ) before a meal was given ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ le in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the meal in comparison to human standards , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) was given .
