<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Relations report (EPAR), which explains how the studies assessed for human therapeutic agents (CHMP), in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the Packagage (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and husks, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), distrust and madness; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients manic episodes (periods abnormal high mood) alternately alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify will be applied for the treatment of moderate to severe severe episodes and prevention of severe episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution will be applied to fast control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to take or the melting pot in patients may be applied to those swallowing tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be dismantled, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agonist for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitters work to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolarity plays a role to normalize Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and its re-occur will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that were increased in increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been compared to 347 patients with semi-operated idol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have re-occur to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that in increased anxiety, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies through to investigate how the body assimilates the melting away and the solution to assimilation (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients who received an bilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significant reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-time studies varied symptoms are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented more effective up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-emergence manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), grading (lamination), gradation (nausea), gravation (nausea), obstruction (increased saliva), tistipation (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomniousness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanpharmaceumeans (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes discussed the treatment with Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee reached the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission shared the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day every day independently of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialdosis should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is set from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide-based behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disruptions and was reported in some cases after the beginning or a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiologic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of addiction with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myokardinfg or ischaemia disease, conditions that are predisposed of hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloodstream medicines) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which a year or less digested, there were occasional reports of during the treatment with Aripiprazoned Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late neodyinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms developed to a mns or not a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all anti-psychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, have to be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used in patients with crampes in the anamnesis or at states that are connected with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an increased Sterberisiko compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the address for undesergerovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazide or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related undesirable events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the application of antipsychotic drugs, where weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with itself overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the resistance rate of Aripiprazole, however this effect is not relevant as clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy promoters increased a highly effective CYP2D6-inhibitor (Chinidine) the Auc of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the Cmax was unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and that is why similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "" "" poor ")" "" (= "" "" poor ")" "" (= "" "" effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma-concentration of Aripiprazole resulting in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolism. "" "</seg>
<seg id="53">If you are considering the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, should have similar effects and that is why similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After completion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the tin levels before the start of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the Aripivotal concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day does not have any significant effect on the Metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethtoman / 3-methodology morphine), 2C9 (Warmeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies at animal health, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential risks justifies clearly the potential risk to fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, even with other antipsychotic drugs, patients should be warned before, dangerous machines, including vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the below side effects is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks joined patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) from EPS including parkinsonism, Akatheist, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with semi-operated idol (57.3%).</seg>

<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks in placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2,0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about whose occurrence also with Aripiprazole, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and increased sterility in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the launch of the market, unintentional transmissions with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a tick bites during the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemialysis is a high plasmaple combination.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenders and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In gift of Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy promoters showed the Positters-emission-dependent reduction in the bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol in comparison to placebo a statistically significant increase of psychological symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a holding of idol-controlled study, 52 of the share of the patients who participated in a study of study, in both groups similar (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperate dol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messskalen, which were defined as secondary study, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressant scale, showed a significant stronger improvement than with Halildol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significant higher reduction in the decline rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olaned-controlled, multinational double-blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included and in which the primary study potential 'weight gain' entered significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole revealed a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two place- and active-controlled monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol demonstrated a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a clue, which was comparable to that of lithium or semi-operated dol week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also pointed 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on like lithium or semi-operated idol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics that were partially more than 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum spoke, revealed the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole a superior effect in reducing severe symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>

<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydride and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyll is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshaltodays is at approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazeboat about CYP2D6 and with nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisians on CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharma cotics between male and female healthy promoters, as well as a pharmacocular investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no sex-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific-specific evaluation of Pharmakokinetics yielded no indication on clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharma coarcs of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacocular properties of Aripiprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure, compared to young healthy promoters.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study among probankers with diverse liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharynprazole and dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies of safety spharmology, toxicity in repetitive administration, reproduction oxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenous potential, the preclinical data could not recognise any particular dangers for man.</seg>

<seg id="291">Myxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequently) that can affect the mode of traffic and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side-effects performed at 229 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma who were treated at the pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenie was the most remarkable important hematological toxicity (compared to 79% of the patients) and was quick reversible and dosisdependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (HB &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with abrasive patients and was severe in three cases (HB &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>

<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal context was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubine agent that encourages the interlocating of microtubules from the Tubular indices and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their debristmerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network that is essential for the vitale Interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumine conveys the transcytosis of plastic components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of Albumine promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transeneliale transportation is conveyed by the gp-60-album receptor is presented and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) is a Paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of myxane for metastatic Mammacarcinoma is supported by 106 patients in two single-related trials and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III-comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma were treated with abrasion, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes by a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic Mammacarcinoma.</seg>

<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repetitive infusion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Custedronic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates patients are subject to patients at Aclasta's risk of kidney disease, reactions to the infusion and osteonekmen (redie of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>

<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 because data is missing for uncertainties and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min), since this patient population has only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hypokalemia is before the start of therapy with Aclasta in sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the quick setup of the effect of Custedronic acid at the bone structure, a temporary hypocrine can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the Gift of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% at Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study involving men (study CZOL446M2308), once again annual administration of Aclasta in comparison to the once weekly gift of Alendronat related to the percentage change of handlebar-BMD after 24 months in comparison to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the Knoasta treatment was examined by patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically validated, mainly light to moderate morbus Paget of the Knox (middle Serum-mirror of alkaline phosphoratase according to 2,6times to 3,0fold age-specific upper average compared to the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg customs acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Risedronat once daily has been proven in two six months studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain-strength and pain-proof compared to the output value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients treated at the end of six month's main study as Responses' Responses (in therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107-treated patients treated at the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach could be maintained with 141 of the patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with risedronage. 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multifuse 5 and 15 minutes of constant infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Custedronic acid at 64 patients yielded the following pharmacocular data, which proved to be dosistically independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the Plasmaspiegel quickly took from &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the highest value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphonic disappearance of the great cycle with half times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ €1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a season Eliminationary period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid decline in the bones and excreation over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the prescribed dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body-Clearance is independent from the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the termination of customs clearance - concentration around 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (Plasmakonzentration against Time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance by Cytochrom P450-Enzymous substances is improbable, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized by humans, and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, nitrogen-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledronic acid corroborated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of creatinin Clearance, and was compared with the 64 studied patients in the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney disorder until a creatinin clearing-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment to the Custedronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">However, there is only limited data for heavy renal dysfunction (creatin) Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest not lettering intravenous single dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, loneliness of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the Auc the 6ple of the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal glands.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application has been administered in 3-minute infusion in 3-minute intervals, administered at intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7fold of the human therapeutic exposure, related to the Auc, corresponds to the Auc, corresponds to).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeatedulated Expositions, which exceeded the maximum of intended Human exposure sufficiently, the toxicological effects occurred among other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common cause in studies with repeated application was a multiply primary spontaneity in the metaphysise of long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all doses, a refund which reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats, one watched a teratogenicity with dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">Rabbits were not observed teratogenic effects or embryo subsequent effects although the motherly toxicity at 0,1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the reduced serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Relations report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanpharmaceuents (CHMP) is described in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied solely (Monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients). • It can be applied together with another diabetesdrug medicine (Dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which cannot be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest remaining dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnic or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphylharnvaccine or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulphylharnosis or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better encoded and the blood sugar level is reduced, whereby type 2 diabetes is better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripleotherapy has been studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylharnance, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized Hämoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar values have been reduced by using the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplete study, the effect of the additional Gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharnic in a lowering of the HbA1c values at 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin, a reduction in the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreasing sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients that may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic cetoacidosis (high heron mirror - satiety level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission shared the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approval for launching Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently adjusted and with which metformin due to contraindications or intolerability is inappropriate (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">To use Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain, and oils, if pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrorovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased curing liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases up to the 3-fold of the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are to be inspected as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as uncleared nausea, vomiting, waiter-plessness, fatigue, appetite, appetite and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient treatment is continued with pioglitazon should be led up to the preset of laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven to stir up fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a tick, under the therapy with pioglitazone stood a minor reduction of the middle hemostals (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematology (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative-controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients suffering from metformin (relative reduction of the hematglobins by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lower extent also in patients under sulphylharnants and insulin (relative reduction of the hemorglobins by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity consists of patients who have pioglitazone as orale twin or three-speed combination therapy with a sulphylresine or as a branch of specialist therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, under the treatment of Thiacolidindionen, including Pioglitazone, was reported on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic broulma with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of Pioglitazone and the appearance of Makulaödems, but warring doctors should report on the possibility of a broulary when patients report about interference of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The expected fractures was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with the women of Pioglitazone treated to women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study about 3.5 years of examination of cardiovascular events, factions were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 0.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) with patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to do a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is discontinued (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions have shown that pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmacology or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-blocker and HMGCoA reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the Auc from Pioglitazone to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the Auc from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under the treatment of pioglitazone which diminished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance from the cervical and thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates to the federal scale.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turkey and the brake indexes of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anascents appeared as frequently as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphylharnic.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency in Pioglitazone was compared to 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazon and on.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the market, rarely over congestive heart failure is reported under Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">It has been conducted a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, factions were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fats and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the result of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients below Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeased study over 12 months, patients, whose blood sugar was adjusted despite dreimonatiger Optimization phase with insulin, to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c is reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to be insulin; a reduction in insulin delivery in the group has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed themselves under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decrease in the album / creatinin quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks for investigation of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-glycemeride and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, however clinically not significantly increased L- cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide, the total plasarglyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazon, there has been no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels while being observed under metformin and Gliclacide residual values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the post-randial triglycerides levels, this is both an effect on the triglycoerid absorption as well as for the hepatic Triglycaerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease in groups that received previously existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application Pioglitazone is quickly resorved, whereby the peak concentration on unchanging picoglitazone usually reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness in approximately the triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In responsive studies, pioglitazon could not be proven to have any relevant effect on the Pharmacology or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Gemfibrochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor (Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging picoglitazone amounts to the people 5-6 hours, and those of the entire active metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmakonzentrations of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function lower than with healthy promoters, but resemble the rates of the oral clearing of the Mother's substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repetitive administration in plasma volume, with hamodifying, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under the treatment of pioglitazone which diminished in the creation of hyperinsulinmia and increased insulin resistance from the cervical and thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="825">In another study on two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each Pioglitazone or Gliclacide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant removal of the Albumine / Kreatinin module has demonstrated a statistically significant comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the post-randial triglyceride levels, this is both an effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as for the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study, participating in the 1 072 patients, the efficacy were compared to different Adenuric doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) with that of a placebo (headlamps) and of Allopurinol (another medicine to treat hyperurimia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study two doses of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, Allopurinol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose urinary urinary organ was placed in the blood during the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of the patients who took the adenuric in a dose of once every day 80 mg, and 65% (175 from 269) of the patients who once daily received a urinary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was at 22% (60 of 268) the patient under Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients suffering from cardiac disease, there may also be an increased risk of certain side-effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for HumanLegal (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in reducing the urinary urinary tract in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid a irritation of esophagus, the patient may not lay down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs that are authorised in the European Union, the company has data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D mirror among patients who were treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than with those who only recorded Alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that the ADROVANCE contained in the ADROVANCE contained exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of musculoskeletal (muscles, bones or joints), constipation (diarrhea), ulcers (diarrhea), ulcers (diarrhea), ulcers (pugnans), ulcers (inferior stomach) as well as acidic strips.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Eco-hageal reactions, such as osophagitis, osophageal Ulzera and Kosovhageal erosions, rarely followed by osophageal Strictures, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronat (partly these severe severe and required a hospital transfer).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms that should point out to possible presophageal reactions and patients should be pointed out at the appearance of symptom ophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain when loping or retrospaceous pain or new or become a lilimmering heartburn and get medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of heavy-hageal side effects seems to be increased in patients that do not take the medicine correctly and / or it according to the occurrence of symptoms that would point to a solution-hageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all the clearance instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large clinical trials with Alendronat no higher risk has been established, rarely (after market introduction) stomach and duodenalulcera, including some severe severe and associated complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonekrose by the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including Osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment was given primarily intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to give the notes whether the lowering of a bisphosphonattherapy in patients requiring an orthosurgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteonekcard of jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alkaline foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, Antazida and some oral drugs can affect the residue of alendronage if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, the patients must wait for at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interviewer studies were not performed, Alendronat was taken in clinical studies with a variety of usually prescribed medicines without that clinically relevant interactions appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for application of postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable to apply for the pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Da kidney function has no influence on the Pharmacology of Tacrolimus, can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serpentine levels, a calculation of creatinsolvency and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion of Ciclosporin on advagraf At the conversion of a Ciclosporine on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the talent level in the full blut The dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of indulgence and tolerability in an individual case under the helpless of full blut-Tacrolimus controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus talents during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf on advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or at the same application of substances that could change the Tacrolimus-full-blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the blood level is not exceed in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the talents are of Tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplanations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adrenal glands and hearty patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent treatment therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants were generally used blood concentration in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious undesirable events, including transplantation, or other side-effects which can occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overflow.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolim formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; conversions of wording or the regime should be made only under the tighter control of one in the transplant experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of transplants at adult heart transplants and transplactic receivers are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of advagaries.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction in the Tacrolimine levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum) contain or other plant cures during a treatment with advagaries (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimine concentrations in the blood, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to significant fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf was one as a cardiomyopathy named chamber or septum hypertrophy to observe, which can therefore also occur under advagaries.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first-term data, the CHMP has continued to be rated as positive, but considering that the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the base of the Safety profils of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs all 6 months, decided that the regulatory authorship should apply for 5 years to request a further extension procedure.</seg>

<seg id="1642">These are a type of virus that genetically modified so that there can be a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "adenovirus" that has changed so that it cannot produce copies of itself and can thus no infections in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been suppressed directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to make the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the not defective in the human body available p53-gene, is normally wearing to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>

<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the submitted documents, the CHMP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP opinion, not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin at Li-Fraumeni-tumor benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not proven sufficient that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP did not take note of whether the withdrawal of the consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "comb use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed active ingredient" "" "means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components are being released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen inflammation of the nose-sideways) in patients with nasal-skin-swelling (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and young adults aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-loop (constitched nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be impaired by the stipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main changes were the changes of the heavyness of the hay symptoms that were reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When contemplating all hay symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients reported the aerinaze, compared with a decrease of the symptoms at 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-loop was considered, the patients showed relieving a relieving of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% in patients who accepted desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykardie (coronary), dizziness, psychic disease), constipation, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolenz (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrin or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic or Loratadine (another medicine used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients suffering from a bottangle glaucoma (hypertension), heart or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidisinfection (hypertension), hyperthyroinfection (hypertension caused by a cerebral blood) or have a risk for an ugly stroke of strokes.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the transfer of aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is whole to swallow (that is, without having to crust or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to misconception and effectiveness (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because in long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrin can decrease in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the loop in the upper breathing, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the drug is also contraindicated in patients infected with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetical activity in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as broocripitin, Pergoydroergotamine or other decongesic, phenylepolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrin, Oxymetacolin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested by patients with kidney or liver disorder, and the data is not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations on dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of hypertension or one Tachykardie or from Palpitations, coronary arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of headaches) must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="1677">For the treatment of following patient groups is advised to be treated: • patients with coronary arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardio-attack in anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder projection or bronze in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminika may prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce the extent to its extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole has been administered additionally, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plastic concentration of desloratadin observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests could not be significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not desloratadine alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes was not yet identified, so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inestimation of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As Reproduction studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and because of the vasoconstrictors properties of pseudoephedrin should be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be elucidated about it, however, that in very rare cases, it may come to a benommenness that can lead to an impairment of the modes of traffic or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a ZNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations) with possible letteries.</seg>

<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially probable in children as well as drip in-typical symptoms (mouthdry, plupillenstire and - dilatation, Hauling, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of proclonal cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastcells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adolescence P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single-dose study with adults showed desloratadin 5 mg does not affect standard measurement sizes, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily has been found no increased frequency of sleepiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, an inachykarst or manifestations of a zNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, where 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the Symptomatic (except nasal-skin-swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect, determined by the nose-skin-order, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed in terms of gender, age or ethnibelonging patient groups no significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the framework of a single dose study of the Pharmacology of aerinaze, desloratadine is shown in 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perorical application of aerinaze with healthy promoters over 14 days the flow-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudo-hedrine and pseudoephedrin can be reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacocular multi-technical study, which has been performed with the formulation as tablet for healthy adult probankers, has been determined that four probandes desloratadin poorly tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A components Interactions study reveals that exposure (Cmax and Auc) of Pseudoephedrin after the only gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalence was equivalent to the exposure to the gift of a aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies of safety spharmology, toxicity in repetitive administration, to genotoxicity and reproduction oxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin however does not allow special dangers to man.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudo-hedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproduction-stoic studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was in the orical gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and an rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day non teratogen.</seg>

<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively in intermittent rhinitis and persistent rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhino-contivitis, Aerius effectively lessened the burden caused by seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urine was investigated for further forms of the Urtikaria, as the underlying pathology regardless of the etiology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited simpler prospektiv.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is a primary factor in all urticultural diseases, it is expected that desloratadin except in the chronically idiopathic Urtikaria is also leading in other forms of the Urtikaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of queues at the end of the first tin intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies involving antihistaminika in chronic idiopathic urine, the minority of the patients who have not been reacted to antihistaminika from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes was not yet identified, so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The studies conducted with desloratadin and Loratadin performed preclinical studies, at a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadin, no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity of desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate the symptoms at allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by infection in children under 2 years (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies should play a role in diagnosing the anamnesis, physical studies and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urine and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be applaud by adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multispecialist in adults and juveniles, in which desloratadine was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced that the company has its application for approval for the transfer of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1-influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to protection against flu that is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that might cause a trunk of influenza, which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of flu-virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man because people have not yet established immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu-virus as "body-alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">By doing so, the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in contact with a flu-virus of this genealogy.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the membranes of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as body-alien), purged and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed in accordance with "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical examination and need further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP recommendations please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years involving human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1), which is the acquired immune system syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, Amenase is available as a solution for inclusion, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir as the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerations should only then be prescribed if the doctor has examined, which antiviral medicines has previously taken, and the likelihood is that the virus is responding to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily to 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerations depends upon the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to heal, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenera has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, who previously had not been treated with proteasworms.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This compared with low dosified Ritonavir enhanced medicines Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, which had previously taken proteasformer, with other proteasworms.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (Viral last) or change the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who previously had no proteasehemently, after 48 weeks under Agenerations, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children reduced Agenerations also the Viruslast, however, treated by the children who were treated earlier with proteasworms, very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, which were treated earlier with proteasworms, that increased with Ritonavir enhanced medicines Agenerations the viral last after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasehemmer:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasuremer, it came under Agenerations along with Ritonavir to a stronger drop in the Viral last after four weeks than in patients who recorded their previous proteasformer:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Ageneric ase (observed at more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence, nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerations may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Amspecavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerations may also not be applied to patients who are cursing the currant (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are in the same way as amoase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, the risk of a Lipoddystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonekrose (abortion of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of infection that will be caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The European Globalisation Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Agenerations in use with other antiretroviral medicines used in combination with proteasworms to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerative ase is usually taken along with the pharmacoinetic amplifier, but the committee stated that the benefit of amoase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously had no proteasformer, not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "" "" "Agenerase was originally approved by" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since the timing of scientific reasons only has limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group Limited approval for the transport of Agenerations throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerative ase is combined with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, proteasehemmer (PI) in adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual, Amenase capsules are intended to be used for pharmacocular boosts of Amspecavir along with low doses from Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amspecavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amspecavir as a solution to take up is 14% lower than by Amspecavir as a capsule; therefore, agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable at a milligram pro milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Amenase capsules is 600 mg Amspecavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Amenase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boostment), higher doses should be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Amenase capsules is 20 mg Amspecavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a day-highest dose of 2400 mg Amspecavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Pharmacology, efficacy and safety of Agenerations in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasworms were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the misunderstanding of data about immemorial and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacocular data, the dose should be reduced to Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to be reduced to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerative ase should not be given at the same time with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plasmakonzentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amspecavir during the intake of Amspecavir during the intake of Amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerations or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunist infections or any other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment of aging does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usual, Amenase capsules are intended to be used together with low doses from Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral therapy, have an increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially deadly disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previous limited liver function, including chronic hepatitis, increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticone or other glucoticoids, which is confused via CYP3A4, is not recommended, unless the possible benefits of a treatment of systemic corticosteroids, including Morbus Cuscino and supcompression of the adrenal function outweighs (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the absorption of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerations with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathia including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards ratio), are available methods for determining the active resource concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients suffering from these medicines at the same time, Agenerations can be less effective because of decreased plasmaspiegel of Amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility metabolic interactions with Amspecavir may be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however, the information cannot be sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored at the expense of symptoms of symptoms, especially if they are also administered for low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high risk of toxicity, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amenase should be reduced to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteasehemmer, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exazabic of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, whose treatment drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In case of haemophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with proteasworms, reports are about an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hammatome and hematthrosen.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or resdual opportunist infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body measure index), cases of osteonekmen were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-substrates with low therapeutic width are not at the same time with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of Cytochrom P450-Isoenzymphs 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width axial with Ritonavir may not be given together with drugs, whose active ingredients are predominantly via CYP2D6, and are linked to the increased plasmaspiegel with severe and / or life-threatening side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin is causing an 82% reduction in the Auc of Amspecavir that can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resale development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to eradicate the lower plasmaspiegel by a dose of other protein inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects were observed at the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amspecavir can be degraded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with curses (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already enrolled curfew are the speckled mirror and, if possible to check the Viruslast and disappoint the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amspecavir (see also ufavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cmax, by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) administered in combination with Amspecavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of Amspecavir twice daily are used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and imbalance of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degrading when Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amspecavir in plasma, which were obtained during the combination of Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A Dosierungdeposit for the simultaneous administration of Amspecavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, there will be a engmaschige monitoring recommended, since the effectiveness and imbalance of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacocular study conducted on the application of Agenerations in combination with Didanzzo, but is recommended due to the inviolate component of Didanzzo, that the revenues of Didanosine and Agenerations are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore with Gift of Efavirenz in combination with Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with efavirenz in combination with Amspecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasepmer would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine to other proteasinimer and existing limited data suggest that nevirapinto the serum concentration of Amspecavir may be sunk.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be utilized at the same time, caution is advisable to be less effective since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly subtherapeutic plastic.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological control is to be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amspecavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amspecavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmakonzentration (Auc) from Rifabutin around 193% and thus an increase in combination with rifabutin associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerations, will get to a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmakokinetic studies with Agenerations in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasmaspieves of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax by Ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the Auc (0-star) at the 2,6943 compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fosaminations avir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with aging, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be directed to toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines when they are used in combination with aging.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteassigmer it is advisable that Antazida may not be taken at the same time as Agenerations, since it can come to residual disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsions known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amspecavir may lead to a humiliation of the plasmaspiegel of Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium-blockers like Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Fellow pin, Niodichpin, Niodilpin, Niodilpin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amspecavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerations can increase their plastic concentration, and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in relation to side-effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days to Probanan intranasal (4 times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate-Plasmaspiegel rose significantly during the endogenous cortisol by approximately 86% Mounted interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of Agenerations with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these Glukokorticoids, unless the possible benefits of a treatment weighs up the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism can be strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are indicated by the Plasmaspiegel with simultaneous administration of Agenerations.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspievement of this HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medicines with Amspecavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirror, as the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of Amspecavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">For this reason, Agenerations cannot be applied together with oral gondazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same application of Agenerations with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteashibitors indicate a possible rise in the mileasper of Midazolam to fold up the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone administered together with Amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored at the expense of symptoms of symptoms, especially if they are also administered for low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historic comparisons, there can currently no recommendation be given as the Amspecavir- dose is to be adjusted if Amspecavir is administered at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With current gift of warfarin or other orical anticoagulants along with Agenerations, a enhanced monitoring of INR (International Standards-ratio) is recommended for the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of anti-thrometbotical effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictible, therefore alternative methods of contraception recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with current Gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied to a careful consideration of possible utility for the mother as compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk transactivating rats, Amspecavir-related substances have been proven, it is not known whether Amspecavir moves to human milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A Reproduction study on tolerable rats, which was administered at the Uterus to the end of the lactation period Amspecavir during the lactation period, showed an diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the surrendering, including fertilisation and Reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Amspecavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The immemorial of Agenerations was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly to moderate, played early up and rarely led to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the intake of Ageneric ase or any other simultaneously to HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects are taken from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which cases were not subject to patients 1200 mg Ageneric ase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), which were standing by the investigators as well as in connection with the study drug, and in more than 1% of patients appeared, as well as under the treatment resultant (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral therapy is associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripherals and faeces fat tissues, multiply intraocular and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsozervikal fat collection (pin).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 anti-retroviral not subject to persons who were treated with Amspecavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine, over a medium duration of 36 weeks, only one case (pairing) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- subject to patients under Amspecavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs for an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin envelopes were usually slightly to moderate, erythematic or makulopapular nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonekrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or resdual opportunist infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI stipulated patients, the 600 mg of generase twice daily together with low dosified Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), were kind and frequency of side effects (degree 2 to 4) and CPK values which were obtained from patients, the Agenerase along with low dosified Ritonavir, very often appeared.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Amspecavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protein and thus prevents the procession virginal and gag-pol- polyproteinous steps with a result of education inconsequent, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The anti-viral activity of Amspecavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both at accut and chronic lymphobic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as at the peripheral hematytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amspecavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µm in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amspecavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamaviavir / Ritonavir-dosages were observed - as with other Ritonavir geboostavir treatment schemas with proteashibitors - the described mutations only rarely observed.</seg>

<seg id="2034">The early release of a depleted therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Agenerations in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (100 mg twice daily) and nuclear therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lower chionavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus-sensitivity to Agenerations, at least another PI and at least a NRTI were included in the substudy A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-embarrassment of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group with regard to the time-adorable average change of output (AAUCMB) in the Viral last (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underweight wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of unexploited Agenerations is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, from which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies agasy solution to take up and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It has been given no low dosified Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients received a plasma-1-RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2044">508% increased for Cmax on it by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) administered together with Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amspecavir with a meal leads to a 25% off the auc, but has no effect on the concentration of Amspecavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by the food intake although the simultaneous intake influenced the extent and rate of Rescue.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seeming volume volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be used on a large amount of distribution as well as an unobstructed penetration of Amspecavir from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the substance in plasma, whereby the amount of unconnected Amspecavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unskilled Amspecavir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active component during the exchange rate in the Steady state in the Steady State via the range of Cmax, ss until Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines must induce or inhibits the CYP3A4 or substrates a substrate of CYP3A4 when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amspecavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amspecavir is available from the solution 14% less bioless than the capsules; therefore, Agenerations solution and Agenerative ase capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrams.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir neglected, therefore the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of Amspecavir and Ritonavir will be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amspecavir-Plasmaspieves comparable to those interested in healthy promoters after a dose of 1200 mg Amspecavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro-gene testing, the bacterial-core mutation tests (Ames test), microkernel test on rats and chromosomes, Amspecavir was not muted or genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver disease can be monitored and detected in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphoratase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far in clinical trials no significant liver disease has been observed in patients, either during the administration of Agenerations yet to the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in juveniles, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate as well as with the speculative animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">A systemic Plasmadura, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutical dosages in humans, however, were observed a number of minor changes including thymus and minor skeletal changes that point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Amenase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boostment), higher doses should be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Amenase capsules is 20 mg Amspecavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a day-highest dose of 2400 mg Amspecavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with a more awake or slight liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amspecavir in plasma, which were obtained during the combination of Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A Dosierungdeposit for the simultaneous administration of Amspecavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, there will be a engmaschige monitoring recommended, since the effectiveness and imbalance of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with efavirenz in combination with Amspecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteasepmer would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological control is to be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amspecavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerations, will get to a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium-blockers like Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Fellow pin, Niodichpin, Niodilpin, Niodilpin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil can be increased by Amspecavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days to Probanan intranasal (4 times a day), the Fluticasonpropionate-Plasmaspiegel rose significantly during the endogenous cortisol by approximately 86% Mounted interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With current gift of warfarin or other orical anticoagulants along with Agenerations, a enhanced monitoring of INR (International Standards-ratio) is recommended for the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of anti-thrometbotical effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to an decrease of the Auc and Cmin by Amspecavir by 22% of the previous version.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, primarily the safety of the drug was tested, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect in terms of reducing the GAG concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children less than five years, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine for about 60%, and half of the children's treated were a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients cannot be recommended as a dosage scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients, patients can develop infusible reactions which are defined as any other side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be tightly monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical environment, in the revitational environment for medical emergency cases.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients can form IgG antibodies to Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction, must be treated with caution in applying aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience is prematurely regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk-reaction after having taken care of the treatment carefully.</seg>

<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponated compared to Laronidase over the mother's milk, it is recommended to relieve during the treatment with Aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse reactions in clinical studies were mainly enrolled as infusible reactions that were at 53% of the patients in Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted pharmaceutical interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during phase-3- study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels were a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the Harn, while in patients with high antibody titern was a variable reduction of GAG in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginal to low neutralising inhibitory effects on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro, which seemed to interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reducing GAG in the resn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug interactions, although the appearance of undesirable pharmaceutical interactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the cumulative substrate and preventing further accumulation of adequate recovery of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is removed quickly from the circulation and cells into the Lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6-phosphorous receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme were tested in a randomised, double-blind, placeased phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study involving the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient referred to the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had a forciated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute- test test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is applied together with cisplatin (a different drug against cancer) in patients who have not been removed from cancer (drug against cancer), and "malignant" (malignant or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is treated in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, should be given before or after the Gift of Cisplatin, in addition one "anti-master" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid lack).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose bloodstream changes or where certain other side effects should occur, the treatment should be uploaded or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed increases the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer active period of time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant Pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their condition.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small lung cancer the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (a different drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (a further drug against cancer), and both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with alimta and cisplatin, survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the all administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with Alimta 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer does not attack the epithelial cells, in administration of Alimta longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">September 2004, the European Commission appointed Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2375">To decrease the frequency and severity of skin reactions, the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift will be given as well as the day after the treatment a corticosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses and intake must continue throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexate dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third Be- Treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients, the Pemetrexed received, prior to each gift, should be created a complete blood image - including a differentiation of the leucocytes and a thyroid counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphorase (AP), aspartame transaminase (AST or SGPT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should amount &lt; 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-check must take place under the tachute of the toning of the blood-image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the forecasted therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hemostological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient is the value in front of the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted if patients occur after 2 tin-reductions a hemostological toxicity or non-hemostasis toxicity degree 3 or 4 or so- continued at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, compared to patients aged 65 years old, there is an increased risk of secondary risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of non-sufficient data to uncertainties and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Clinical trials were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min no Dosisations necessary that go beyond the dosage customizations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance of below 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients were evaluated with a liver functionality of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper Bilirubin- Border and / or transaminasenvalues from &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (near liver disease) or &gt; 5,0 times of the upper limit value (for presence of liver breast cancer), not specifically studied in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to the level of Knox and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute Neutral number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Throgenic - cylinders that have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute NeutrophilenNumber, Thropractic number and maximally non-haemological toxicity, such as they were observed in previous treatment cycles - the (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 haematological toxicity like neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie was treated - if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be reliant on the patients treated with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to be used for reduction in-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal anti-oxidants (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- Tens 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy with Pemetrexed is envisaged, must avoid taking NSAIDs with lengthy half-time time for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, predominant hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid-speed collection in the transcellular space, a drainage of the ergometer is replaced before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardicardiovascular events, including myokardinfarrests, and zerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application attenuate vital substances (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of an irreversible skull and reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment - ginine to get advice regarding the sperm production.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroidal anti-logistic (NSAIDs), such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalyl acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a decreased pronunciation with the result of a multiplication of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsaline acid are applied in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- Tens 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed should be avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As no data is available with regard to interaction potential with NSAIDs, such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variation of smell status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oralen anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Standardisation Ratio) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with oralen anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed at pregnant women, but as with ande- ren Antimestolites are expected in an application in pregnancy heavy birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessarily - demanding and after careful consideration of the user for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment plan, advice on the spermating.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cplatin), and with chemotherapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the extra gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as anti-master).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, because among the effects in this age group is not enough information available.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi studied in three main studies to 1 842 adults, the chemotherapy regimens received, which are strong or even trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">With chemotherapy regimens, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients treated with aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi were no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">When compared to Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki n Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the transport of Aloxi across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting with severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer of cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting with moderemetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy induced by adding one before the corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosis tron the colon-days can prolong the colon days, patients should be monitored with anamnesty Obstiation or signs of a sublingual Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable for simultaneous administration of Palonosis tron with drugs that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qone interval prolongs or which tend to obtain such extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with a further chemical therapeutics gift, Aloxi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies inhibits Palonosetron that is not directed against tumors of the five examined chemotherapy therapeutics (cystine, Cyclosein, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacological interactions formed between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosis tron and a Steady states- concentration oralen Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacocular analysis was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (Dexzine, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Chinidine, Chinidine, Chinidine, Chinidine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosis tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosis tron at human pregnancies lie not before, so Palonosetron in pregnant women should not be applied unless it is necessary from the treating doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical studies were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least possibly stood with aloxi in relation to headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive reactions and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosing, similar frequencies of undesirable events as in the other centres groups; there were no dose treatment to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the great distribution of distribution, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy in a aloxian overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies were obtained a total of 1,132 patients with &lt; 50 mg / m2, Carboplatin, Carboplatin, Carboplatin, &lt; mg / m2 (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received, which was given on day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, which received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m, Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given on day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetoed chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosis tron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc-Intervalls are comparable to the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the inentricular de- and repolarization involved in the ventricular channels and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of EKG-effects of i.v. administered Palonosetron in single-pants from 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Reset After intravenous gift follows an initiate elimination of the Plasmakonzentrations a slow elimination from the body with average terminally half times of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plastic concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentrations-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire tin range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosis tron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, between day 1 and day 5 measured middle class (± SD) increase in the Palonosis tron plasma Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacocular simulations, the resulting intravenous form of 0.25 mg Palonosis tron was comparable to 3 consecutive days with the value of 0,75 mg of measured value; however, the Cmax was higher than 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys, and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolism, which compared to Palonosis tron is less than 1% of the antagonistic effects on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolishing have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, the Isoar CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron was found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as unchanging substance made some 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolus injection at healthy, the total body-up was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver disorder the terminale elimination period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction in the dose is thus not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects have been observed only after expositions that are considered sufficiently via the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a little relevance to the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Of preclinical studies reported evidence that Palonosetron is able to block only in very high concentrations of ions, who are involved in the ventricular determinants and repolarization and extend the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (every dose passed in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure to men), which have been given daily over two years, led to a proliferated frequency of liver tumors, hypophyae, pancreas, pancreas, carnieces) and skin tumours in rats, but not on mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is intended to use human beings on a unique application, the relevance of these results are assessed as to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 The Committee for HumanLegal Affairs (CHMP) adopted a negative report, which approved the approval for the approval of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C approved by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same pattern as an effective component already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Studies").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for treating adult patients with chronic (long prolonged) hepatitis C (one by a viral infection caused by liver infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">With a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue has damage, and also the values of the liver enzymatic Essential Aminsferase (ALT) is increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon put data prior to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, acting, safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference practitioner by 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment courses and 6 months after the treatment of treatment responded to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed concerns that the data is not sufficient to the stability of the substance and market of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment of Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After hiring the treatment with Alpheon flamming the disease in more patients than with the reference practitioner, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, the test was conducted in the study to investigate the question of which the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetitions (one with cracking-formation) and small infected Lazarus (crissor or cutting), abrasion and paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven detectable or probably due to methicillinresistant stackus aureus (MRSA) because alarm goes against these kinds of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial reefs (the parts of the bacteria, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was rejected at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and cefalexin similar contact: when the results of both studies were assembled at Hautweighties, about 90% of the patients of both groups spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, noticed that Altargo has been caused during the treatment of abscesses (vain cavities in the body tissue) or from infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which has been observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation in the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for HumanLegal Affairs (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo weigh in short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections against the risks: • Impetigo, • incorrectly small Lazarus, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission issued the Glaxo Group company Ltd. a permit for the transfer of Altargo into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, in which two or three days were no bettering, should once again be investigated and an aging therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or severe local irritation through the application of Retapamulin salbe, the treatment is canceled, the ointbe carefully folded and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methoxicillin forklihylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2-day treatment, no improvement or worsening of the infected point occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low Plasmakonzentrations, which were achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant Hemorrhoea is not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 times a current gift of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin Auc (0-24) and Cmax according to topographic application of 1% Retapamulin salbe on unrestricted skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, can therefore not be deemed necessary when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive oxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the federal states / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin salbe should be used only during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the use of Retapamulin to be preferred to the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / finished or the therapy with Altargo continues to be terminated, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo used was the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the administration resort that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of pleuromutilin, a substance, which is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The actuator mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a certain relationship of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal inter-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bond-center protein L3 involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding center and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this bond-place inhibiting pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be based on the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Retapamulin to at least some infection forms, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin towards S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methoxicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-interest to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Qualification In a study with healthy adult 1% Retapamulin salbe daily under occlusion on intact and screened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topographic treatment of secondary wounds have been won single plastic.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 among the adult patients each before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion of people according to topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP shirt.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism in human liver microSomen was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The owner of the approval for the transfer must ensure that a pharmacoarthritis system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application application (version 6.2) is available and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product marketed is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the approval of the approval was obliged to conduct further detailed studies and additional pharmacocular activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as additional updates to the RMP module, which will be agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Foruse products for human use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms shown at the right place, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface that will be treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15, who are not immute against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two doses, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when the immunisation consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is assured that the existing vaccination plan can be led by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given to another hepatitis C or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have a function by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body) "as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has obtained the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens, and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the previously approved vaccine Twinrix adults and the previously approved vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three doses existing vaccination schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because ambirix and Twinrix included adult ingredients, some of the data used the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the share of the vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody-centric one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of appetite, pain in the injection, redness, matiness (tiredness) as well as friction.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may be used in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic) cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 shared the European Commission of the Company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix across the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardization plan for the Grundimmed with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of the election and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher can be desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate Mongolian vaccines or with a combinant simplette.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C surface (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) - and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) -antibody values are in the same proportions as after the vaccine with the respective monovals vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely secured, whether immunological individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher risk as protection, since they are also protected by immunological memory at no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and supervision.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combinant simple, the 360 ELISA-units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with Throgenic cytopenia or consular disorders, Ambirix may be injected in these cases after intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambirix in the second year in the form of a seperate injection, Tetanus-, acellular Poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- mumps-Tubes vaccine was given, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective, it must be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study involving three vaccinations of these formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matography, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the incidence observed in the former Thiomercial and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccines have been administered in a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-doses combos.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness on a calculation base per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the promoters observed, compared with 39.1% in the promoters after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinant simple.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the promoters had given the Ambirix, about pain, compared to 63.8% with the Probankers, which were vaccinated with the 3-Dos- combinant simplette.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of matology was comparable per promill (i.e. via the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the promoters, which received ambient, compared with 36.2% with the promoters that received the 3-doses combinant simpp).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of precursors and matriiness was low and comparable to that, which after administration of the compression simplier has been observed with the 3-canned vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2806">However, since ambirix is limited only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be defective in patients aged over a month with incomplettem Enzymective or with hyperammonastic encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammonary concentration) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split up on several individual cans to the meals - swallowed among the food mixed or over a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal blanket) or a nose-sonde (through the nose to the stomach of the hose) administered.</seg>

<seg id="2813">The use is indicative in all patients in which a complete Enzymous deficiency has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifeste form (incomplete Enzymkt, which manifests itself after the first life-month) there is an indication of use when in the Anamnese is a hyperammonstrous encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with slip-dysfunctions, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually by the proteinment of protein and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifeste deficiency at Carbamylphosphate synthetase or Ornithinimcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine appuccinatsynthetase shortage must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered for patients with looptic disorders, as a risk for the emergence of ocarhogany leaves, if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, correspondingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium pro 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure, or severe kidney failure, as well as in case of sodium reforming and odehydration levels.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out over the liver and the kidneys, AMA should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonochian encephalopathy, the survival rates were 100%, but even in these patients it came with time at many with intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-maniac form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygum form of the Ornithistorical bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonolatrotery and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinated diet, was the survival rates 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is interpreted in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism in plasma and urine have been determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrin with liver cirrhosis, and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also investigated by cancers of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>

<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed by the application and the Bolusdosis rapidly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg Infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney functionality (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be used a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second Bolusdosis is administered by 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT test again 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients have been carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if in PCI-patients under Bivalirudin occur most bloodlines to arterial punctuation, can undergo from patients who occur in a subcutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while the treatment generally occur anywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking care of warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, the value of the INR leaderboard (International Standards-Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bivalirudine is re-reached in front of the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, warfarin, Thrombolysis or thyroid aggregators) can be assumed that these active substances will increase the blood danger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudine with the thyroid aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostal gland are regularly scrutinized in any case regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal-experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the delivery or post-postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thromwood inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the animonenbindings region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is tied in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudine at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin smuggled the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly improves the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudine with serum of patients, in which there has been in the past to heainduced Throspinal cytopenie / heetininducted Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce any thyroid aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">For healthy promoters and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dosis- and concentricular effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patient was carried out below a PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention on 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra becomes subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm injected or infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or that insulin is not effectively processed.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from humanization, and the change means that it has a faster effect and has a shorter period of time than a short-effective humanization.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body can produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, in which the body can not be effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of the substance glycosyllized Hämoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving type-1 diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0.14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) has been observed when compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% at human normal.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any of the other components or in patients suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission appointed Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is referred to as subcutaneous injections either in the area of the abdominal wall, the waiter-angle, or the delaying angle, or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and diminished insulin delivery, insulin can be cut down in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of manufacturing can be a change in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the demolition of treatment, especially in patients with an insulant diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic cetoacdose; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of one patient to another insulin type or a insulin delivery should be made under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the work profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase the bloodshed activity and amplify the inclination to hypoglycaemics include orale antidiabetic, angiotensin-Converting (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxidiyllin, Propoxyps, Salizylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betablockers, Clonidine, gulonidine and reserpine may be the symptoms of the adrenders regulation, or are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on Reproduction oxicity showed no differences between inflation and human rights in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin-milk enters into human mother's milk, but generally insulin occurs neither in the mother's milk, nor is it resorved after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the clinical trial known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organelles and ordered according to decreasing the frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency on the basis of the remaining dates cannot be underestimated).</seg>

<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Ud neglect to change the injections within the injection area, can occur in a result of a lipodystrophy in the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycaemics with consciessness can be treated by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injections (0.5-1 mg) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Glukagonally, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be occurs faster in the efficiency of insulin and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem standard.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people at the age of 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin showed insulin range of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg for a dose of disproportionate effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise of glucosy effect, just like humanize.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast as normal humanization and achieves the full glucosity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was evident that in an application of insulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal is achieved a comparable postpranal glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal weight, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin was done in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-ranational control was achieved as having a human normal weight, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is achieved in 15 minutes after the meal starts, a comparable glycaemic control is given like with human normal, which is 2 mixed-nudes before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal in comparison to human normal weight, 30 minutes (normal - 30 min.) before the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal weight, 2 minutes (normally - before) before a meal was given (figure 1B).</seg>
