the module Web site can be found in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu items under ex@@ tras . select the list and target language of the translation .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated in place of the whole &amp; URL ;
machine translation is only very rudi@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , ten@@ tions are not able to make important decisions without the translation beforehand .
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ site yourself , where you can insert a translated text directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
for more information about using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose settings to set up extensions .... open the menu card tools and choose the desired modules there .
this is a list with standard setup modules from the package box ; add @-@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; click ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of the crash , if any , delete .
the module review filter ( also called folder filters ) can be accessed in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up @-@ to @-@ date work directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree @-@ view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; use ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default , the display begins with the root no@@ des of the document , example : the element , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to make the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of a sp@@ elled folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map graph@@ ically . each object is proportional to its size , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereas the size of an order is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be detected within the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; it is an entry in the Tre@@ emap that represents a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the right corner of meaningful color and instruction settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is turned over view color mode , can either be a depth of light detection , or the illustration of a different file name such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can determine if enough space is present at all , or whether the surface is being used by sub@@ ordinate cells ( whereby therefore display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the tre@@ ad ) . furthermore , you can define the relative position of marking in the rect@@ angle .
when designing algorithms for tre@@ ad@@ aps should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the item . during the tre@@ ad in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be respected in order to present the tigh@@ tening entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rect@@ angle square is square .
as divi@@ ding the surface area of an item for the sub@@ ordinate entries remains the implementation is left up . here it is for the protection and prevention of space loss by means of getting advantageous to divide the areas that are as square . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second .
you can set the minimum present area for an entry over the menu entry view on area . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the superior item , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an ordered entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , designed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
the module photos can be found in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu with ex@@ tras @-@ image ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
if you access the module gallery , you will open a dialogue with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .
the option title allows you to adjust in a text box to the title of the picture gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Option per line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option has a sli@@ ders and a screen@@ shot to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can display the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ en@@ ame of the image to see if the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed in the gallery images .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera set will help you connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; checking ; more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; checking ; together .
&amp; checking ; contains a fast image processing with base machine tools . you can use this to review your photos , review , evaluate and correct . processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules easily .
although &amp; checking ; easy to use , it provides d@@ utz@@ ing professional skills at your disposal . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color @-@ colour and all available modules support the raw conver@@ sions by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC @-@ colour management work@@ flow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , can be searched for .
like all &amp; none ; it &apos;s also available ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; checking ; tries to make the milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . where also you are in the program , the help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens up a dialog with a lower linking system . if you want to use this link , your web browser opens a page in the error system . all required information is listed here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; checking ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking ; we can ask you questions to other users of &amp; checking ; however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should have spoken english , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also check the checking out ; homepage to visit news on shared versions and other information about &amp; checking ; to experience .
the best start to get involved and take part , is the registration in the developer @-@ mailing list . guidance for en@@ roll@@ out in the developer @-@ mailing list of &amp; checking ; .
when you arrived &amp; checking ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . here you can specify a local , remote or remote folder , just enter a folder name or click the folder icon folder , to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . this path will remain the same for all the pictures .
later , you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; checking ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings to set up the collections .
if you have already a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; checking ; don &apos;t look at any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passage of the folder you will receive a progress as this one :
&amp; checking ; dur@@ um recur@@ sive the libr@@ arian in all its depth . you cannot finish any sub@@ folder , unless it list in hidden folder . this allows you to have an exceptional folder ; do this by ordering a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in my Al@@ ben@@ list are not displayed as symbols . you can change the picture by making a most user photo of the album and take this on the folder symbol . for more details , see the section albums .
once you configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; checking ; your digital camera set up . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and mine key@@ note to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ pt : if you use the rough mode of your camera , you can use it ; possibly also to deal with it . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help blan@@ kam@@ era@@ work .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera set will help you connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; checking ; more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; checking ; together .
modern digital cameras record the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will also be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also use the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; checking ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transferring images of digital cameras to billing and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions over the serial port are slowly , this connection has now been de@@ prec@@ ated . &amp; checking ; supports these cameras and introduces the images to the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found at this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that the thumb@@ nails will be read by checking out . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might find precau@@ tions possibly nothing or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; checking ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much simpler , &amp; checking ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; checking ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
that goes and disc@@ ard it from pictures : you can drop a picture in another part of the alp , via the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture does not appear in keywords , dat@@ ums@@ list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the common most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for fields that are currently displayed in the symbolic view . so the filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind table view is displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo gallery . these albums can be sorted in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folder in which it was created on the disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date , where the album was first created , the album can be altered in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan the album Im@@ por@@ e images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select the album Im@@ por@@ e Screen photo .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop out there . you can move on the same way several photos or copy . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ properties allow you to submit information about this collection . to access the album properties , click on the album and edit the album menu button .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can select or delete your photos from you . if you want to add or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums after date .
the buttons elder , average , newest : this set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or that of the passage of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change in each file is used in this folder .
when you first came up an album in the album , the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As night@@ stand @-@ click , you can select the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be swal@@ lowed .
&amp; checking ; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the section mine key@@ word list on the left below in the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window displays you the main view of your photos available . if you choose an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo will appear in a preview , you can custom@@ ize the size of these curtains in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you have to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid them in which you can generate in the menu ex@@ tras .
information about each image is displayed below the site preview . which information is , you can change about settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area of thumb@@ nails your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help to rest . if you want to rest the mouse @-@ cursor a moment on a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section introduction to the main window displays such a Help window .
photos are all that it comes with &amp; checking ; albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the features that come with &amp; checking ; possible , via the context menu of the preview or the menu picture in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing of images , a di@@ asch@@ au or the editing of the images .
you can open image editing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 image ... or select the right @-@ click menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . with the image processing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; checking ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button . this , and how you adjust to your needs , if your program is not enumer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing with other image processing programs can come to problems with the data contained in the image . some programs do not save the modified image . this provides this information from the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; checking ; introduces two possibilities for rotating . the simplest is to click on the thumb@@ nails with the right mouse button . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep enlargement ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; checking ; delete , it will be moved into the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postponed . F@@ 8 image Dele@@ te or de If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; discharge .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ ums@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; checking ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file .
if you choose a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the file name , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers that have been assigned to individual photographs or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sample or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word , are displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thereby , you can also organize your keywords . you can also cl@@ apping parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , so that you can search the tags you are looking for , easily find .
the tags are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . so you can also use your tags in other programs . furthermore , the tags at the loss of the database re @-@ imported , once &amp; checking ; the images have noticed .
you can add new tags by clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , or click on an existing key@@ word , and then select new key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing one , this is the word word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and Dele@@ te . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu , which gives you the possibility to push the key@@ word . one point may be at a time only once in the tree .
you can edit the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the keywords , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select a different photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and click in the context menu Next . in addition , you can set the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
to use &amp; check ; s functionality with keywords , you must first select your photos in the tree &amp; quot ; mine key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate word in the tree &amp; quot ; mine key@@ word quot ; draw and drop it there . alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the right @-@ click menu key@@ word .
you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords to a weight , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the picture in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can click with the right mouse button of the photos and select from the tags menu . the menu shows you only the tags that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can click through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower right of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your choice . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , Reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ ums@@ y and in the future even more .
f@@ og@@ ging er search box is a small lamp the green is when the search will find . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this you get a simple search box like that the above described above . you can have this search here however as a search query that always typ@@ ed the fil@@ tered out what you have entered as a search crit@@ erion . once you have been saved , t@@ d er filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and search will be done . the results are displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your search for a search list , you just have to select the appropriate entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select search , the form to input the search again appears with the previously noted search information . if you can edit an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules in search of the Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , check out the right @-@ click menu .
the Exp@@ and@@ ed Search will provide you with an exten@@ dable search form with a number of search parameters that you have entered into certain fields of &amp; checking ; s database can search for you .
the list of search rules will be used to add the options for a search request in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option can be added to this list using the logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ f ... link up . furthermore , you can find searching &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create .
&amp; checking ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare this sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two image sig@@ natures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each image to a similar . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : record a fast sketch and &amp; checking ; find the matching pictures . also here a s@@ ell@@ value can be set .
this rider is an intuitive card tool , based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can press and post@@ p@@ one with the mouse @-@ wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
in the box below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; checking ; provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ ate added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the bul@@ b and open its window . if you are back in &amp; checking ; main window , you can open the illumin@@ ate quickly with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nails , you can see the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window range is to see . if you can preview or carry on one of the images in the other picture , then you can also compare it with the other image . you can thus compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to adjust quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the areas of the screen . use the left mouse button at any previous image to display it in the right @-@ hand side . this makes it simplified through a series of similar images .
naturally , the normal sol@@ vers work directly from the bul@@ b as e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visually differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in switching function , which you can detect on the crossed arrows . to preview the visible area of the picture , you need to click this one and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in mode then both images show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to get into the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are viewing in mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion management ? digital inventory at all part of the process follows after the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ anned or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory . but most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , use , protect and use photos again . we consider the download , ren@@ ame , convert , group@@ ing , evaluate , evaluate , qu@@ ir@@ ed , archive , maintain , maintain , export and export of images .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale inventory cap@@ tures , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , trans@@ forms , trans@@ duc@@ ed , and exports content that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ itable .
met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata , according to your definition data , provide information about or provide documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know &amp; checking ; . the approach allows met@@ adata to save both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving , which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know anything you need to maintain in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos are to save or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please note that you will have to change on a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can easily be found in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images that you print or post on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , working procedures , constant export of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files have , and you will then not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking is simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the met@@ adata option to save met@@ adata in the file page . this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written in the file . if you forget this , then you can load the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what is to change ? this includes a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now select any photo keywords , cap@@ ri@@ gs and an evaluation . of course , you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute and then put the value then . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos on the other hand .
let us now proceed with keywords , keywords , as you often continue with other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cataly@@ zed images from another source of embedded sampling , then it &apos;s checked ; automatically the tree for you to build the images to the right place . the changed keywords are being completed by the tree ; the changed keywords are being pursued by &amp; checking ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata re@@ alises itself . this is a very crude representation , as each block of met@@ adata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates can be found for all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tures or comments , the third important tool to cataly@@ ze your met@@ adata .
you want most not to let your photos just be seen , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas completely .
for others who view your photos is the title possibly more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key it is the meaning of the viewer to help Him through the mot@@ if you &apos;ve moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a marking for himself alone .
with &amp; checking ; you can save you as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) if you can use it for a selection of images at the same time . KDE also provides you with a spelling check . you need to tell you the story of your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you need to tell the story so for the de@@ ple@@ dge a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it the earth not a boring planet in front of goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with images the train runs the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already inn@@ um@@ erable and are still far @-@ reaching in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also open k@@ ml files you can open with goo@@ dies Earth . this then shows the photos at the recording location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice of copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information on the setup page of &amp; checking ; as information is stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . after that value , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for fibre @-@ line ) : linked to the author . examples may be the working designation of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : An@@ de@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled as well .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a camp photo , the group / agency will be displayed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has no protection against abuse . anyone who is embedded in the picture is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important on the other hand .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; checking ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper images or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection of the world , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must not buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your discretion .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good disco@@ s and good recording devices and they are in the right way store . so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it is about to select the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . in spite of this massive protection they are needed for format@@ ting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to perform wonders in CDs and DVDs . however , similar applications are not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the For@@ mat@@ ing War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ Lay@@ er DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that can be said to CDs and DVDs and also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
slowly burn with a good reception device on high quality media in a not propri@@ ate format . read then the media with a description , date &amp; author labels and then store on a clean , dark dry and pre @-@ protected site store . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer &apos;s boo@@ sters include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard@@ disks : dis@@ error
shortly : disco hold the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ ament , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of the SM@@ ART announced errors announce the immediate immediate exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are in particular read@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing number . the expected life @-@ time amounts to between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss of loss , due to excessive voltage . of course , you can also get data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files , but these losses normally can be re @-@ established without major problems .
while most electric devices are not making a lot of account , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage , complete data loss , hardware alter@@ nating , break@@ age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from in@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of the energy heat absorbed and cuts the rest . it is usually available in the form of a p@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar . keep in mind that not every p@@ ec@@ ker@@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also be careful that it protects the protection against ligh@@ tening and thus protect the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can use to your computer , you should also be sure that all Peri@@ pher@@ als machines , which are connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protective devices that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable and television card .
if you have a notebook , you &apos;ll need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . this means that you are ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system will be protected from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a fall of a few seconds may result in the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ breaking power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ tension , these devices automatically provide cordless energy , if a power cut off . this gives you the possibility to save your data and re @-@ run the system . if you buy a US@@ V you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concern the potential risk , which your machine system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all cable before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer which allows you to store any data .
you are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore intended only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com set out online storage services that are available on photos . your professional version is more available to you , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ a year you will have unlimited memory , which should only be verified in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safely .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transmis@@ sions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ es@@ ystem se@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least secure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your computer . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection for you in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interactions within the data stream . with normal fil@@ es@@ ystems this error remains un@@ noticed .
even if you &apos;re not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records on lower level and can be scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under one to GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ es@@ ystem . it is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same prot@@ ections used in the Alpha status and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in job systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the percentage of theft is already 50 % .
data loss based on viruses is less common than the Me@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations ; and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; long no longer has been sighted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Canc@@ ell@@ ate , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture @-@ settings from the fundamental physical limits . meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise @-@ characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras will go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
one 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not get anyone else responsible for data loss . so keep your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or the magnitude of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA @-@ drive . if , then one day , a lightning strike will have you luck when the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster struck locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ brush : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local store . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since last backup . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup occurs next with the exception that it is only down@@ lighted and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ crip@@ ts copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh .
secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or another optical medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , original keep memory , storage , scal@@ ability , media , recovered from images and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... , use of the internet .
thus valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really remember you because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature is un@@ predictable , you need to consider everything that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to let yourself be compatible with caution . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain wa@@ ver . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easily it is the question of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available nowadays for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have been planning the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not attach them .
the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , fatal 16 , 32 and re@@ armament &amp; dollar ; res@@ ize@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of an iron if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
gif is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace the G@@ IF . however , it can save X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . P@@ NG may have relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F requires and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed shape or container with a loss free compres@@ sion@@ ment ( de@@ br@@ ate ) . a problem is however , that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital neg@@ atives format is a licensed and open air format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to use met@@ adata . a handful of cam@@ er@@ ers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nik@@ on it also at some time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is available with extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the data for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . however , since the met@@ adata can be found separately from the image file . however , you should think about problems in linking between the met@@ at@@ end@@ ate@@ i and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you are using DN@@ G as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata , which supports a large range of applications and modelling , discussions and collective work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your shell archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a subtle editing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; checking ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into Web@@ Gallery , code in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print , etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking . in the section add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can have photos , which you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file arrangement for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a contract or met@@ adata .
this dialog displays files characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras you will not be available all the information .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , producer , GPS , etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; checking ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata must not be available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera into one album in &amp; checking ; while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the requested with the default methods of &amp; k@@ ens . once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download . the selected select is long as long as you have chosen some photos .
when your camera is supported it is an option new download@@ able . these pictures have not yet been downloaded by &amp; checking ; in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images are downloaded .
when you download the buttons all download or download , appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is sorted , as normal folder . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; checking ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once , by del@@ eting the button Dele@@ te All . if you only want to delete a few , you must first select it and delete the selected .
note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they should therefore check carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete them from the camera , you should do so much faster than cam@@ er@@ amen , since this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually rep@@ uted once you load photos of different lifts into the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image was made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ alog@@ ing sub @-@ based shel@@ ters . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different calendar format than the standard format , you can e.g. use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % D : % S . turn off the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the str@@ ing@@ time command .
if you use the config file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; checking ; used for a photo , the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; checking ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera on the time @-@ point of recording , in order to perform an automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , leaves , and checking out ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want the automatic turn off , use the button and select the Autom@@ atic spin in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available , it can &amp; checking ; all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case stores , and checking out ; the photos are right next to the target album . if you want to change this , you have to switch this option . use the button @-@ based sub@@ version at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computers to their camera is the button download . select the file in@@ appropriate dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ ens ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; checking ; you where the pictures are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position that is indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo@@ graphs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to use an area through automatic recording of the GPS data to carto@@ graphies . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can click with a click to open the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; checking ; users want to send the place the photos therefore , or simply document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , se@@ mit@@ es and card refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on D@@ SLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data of images and GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo

action can be selected based on embedded preview or image processing . you allow the standard behavior of &amp; checking ; however , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for downloading from the camera system . also , with a database synchron@@ isation , this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author is a syn@@ onym for tw@@ isting foot@@ er : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations like e.g. An@@ de@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or more independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description for the author , this field must be filled .
publishers will be a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to provide the description of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a picture photo , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press ; . if the picture is a camp photo , then the group or agency should be displayed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . thus , the met@@ adata is permanently included in the image and not only entered into the database of &amp; checking ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported , without getting lost .
images can be stored in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . caution : in pictures that already contain signs , these are already written by the checking ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; checking ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to specify which file types &amp; checking ; display , you can add the file expan@@ sions to this list and remove . each file in a &amp; checking ; Alb@@ um@@ folders , which has none of these extensions , ignored and ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Cur@@ ches right from each category .
the settings of the illumin@@ ance of &amp; checking ; can then be set on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can hereby receive better vision results .
by default , the image processing has used a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ min@@ ated areas of an image can be marked with darker or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this vision mode can be integrated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia .
by setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch the De@@ fl@@ ates -@@ Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm .
with the attitude of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can choose loss @-@ free . even if you choose the loss of loss loss and file size far better than in the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; checking , the image processing was just a picture @-@ concerned for photos . currently , it develops quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the standard increase is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option to react more sensitive to ultra @-@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines . if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the picture a little soft , however the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern can be eliminated with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this option is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ min@@ ed images in four steps will get more details in the sh@@ re@@ ws . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the nickname , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera will capture the sh@@ lich@@ ess . use the setting @-@ in @-@ wh@@ ites in different Ros@@ es. finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ alism .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; checking ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when you re@@ construct the option you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value after your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; checking ; image processing should be too small , you should proceed as conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process designed to provide a complete image of the particle data , which will have many cameras and which provide a matrix colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ construction .
&amp; checking ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it creates far@@ c@@ te@@ fac@@ te at edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the col@@ ouring of your lenses , you can set the rot@@ or and blue proo@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color scheme , as you will be carried out during the blan@@ king .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; checking ; information such as the color @-@ information of a color @-@ level in the others are to be translated with the colors as accurately as possible .
behaviour Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files .
color profile folder Set@@ ts here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can store all your profiles . &amp; checking ; examines this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ el@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed after opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures coloured not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the cam@@ er@@ ers and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not have any color @-@ tone or gam@@ ma@@ correctly . currently , d@@ cra@@ b Gamma is not required for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ profile which you em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print picture , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated with it . this could you manually correct , instead of leaving for the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not at the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles working together . this answer is of course incompatible :
the Canon extension provides the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface which is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image concerned and image editing ; many modules support which were written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , check out a list of available modules . select those you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short sub@@ commands to tasks run by modules can be set in the menu below settings shor@@ eline .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper re@@ gler j@@ us@@ hes the time between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other An@@ cross@@ fields turn the met@@ adata a or out , which finishes at the bottom end of the images during the display .
camera characteristics show a list of all cameras on the left side . on the right side there is a camera detection working on the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the image mode . these are currently serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s@@ able , specify on which you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , put it into the display mode .
try out if &amp; checking ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set camera and port manually . after you set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera in the menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ boards , you can set the conversation of &amp; checking ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Dele@@ te of a Photo and Dele@@ te of a Albums you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by checking , if you use the option changes to the right side bar without any set@@ backs . otherwise , you need to apply changes to the button .
you can also stop the ad of welcome screen and checking out ; while star@@ ing it , this acceler@@ ates the start @-@ up process of &amp; checking ; .
the setup starts to search for new photos &amp; checking ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the time time to new or deleted albums / photos . if something has been deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; checking ; you know if it is to delete it from the database .
different shades can be used in &amp; checking ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your tastes . these settings can be chosen under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be enumer@@ ated below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; checking ; contains a quick picture editing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and enhancement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button , preview and selecting the item displaying / edit .
the image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top of the edge and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most common functions .
the editing functions of the image processing changes your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file Save or the button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving .
as long as you don &apos;t have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the button File Rest@@ ore , or the button The button Rest@@ ore re@@ producing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last store .
virtually every action of the image processing can be und@@ re@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can und@@ one by selecting editing , or restored , by selecting editing from the menu .
if you use this often , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the cat@@ chy and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re @-@ establish .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back @-@ in or re @-@ manufacture button in the tool@@ bar you can press a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word , by using the navig@@ ational buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the default menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . usually you do not want to use the tool@@ bar . if you do not like this , you can change this in the setup dialog by &amp; checking ; you can call this section from the schedule window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the picture in the menu , and get the standard &amp; box ; pressure dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can select individual images or whole sets . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ters . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; checking ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navig@@ ational camera , even in the editing room . it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked :
Multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
in the marking view , you can input or insert bul@@ locks with unlimited size or insert . note that all special features are allowed . the sign@@ ments are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ s and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC @-@ data support only AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are selected according to 2000 characters and are special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC sign@@ post in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , you can either use the button applic@@ ation@@ or simply switch to the next image , the sign@@ posts are then stored .
besides the user @-@ button , there is a button . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also select the met@@ adata to the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the Review review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ word overview shows a search box to the filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously contained in this &amp; checking ; session required key@@ word .
the keywords tree will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of key@@ socket on a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ings of the corresponding arri@@ vals in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the whole selection , If you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section of the sample filter .
the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and view@@ points . if in addition one or more key@@ boards are used in the right hand , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all provided keywords are available .
you can also draw tags and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view , to draw you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialogue that you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords , which has been selected with Str@@ g + a , and after that , a key@@ word was drawn from the right keywords on the selection and put aside . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be displayed under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created it and discover that it should be a or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry to search for the database in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can choose a search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to checking ; s made concrete implementation .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colors come from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or in the web publish them from your digital dark @-@ chamber .
when the issue comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the outcomes he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on color administration . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informal decisions to make you make the desired result .
if your educational work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that has been calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ming m . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image spending are via e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard .
so when s@@ R@@ GB works so well and that life is so easy for all , why should one use another color and thus have to worry about colour managers ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colours we really can see below is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ bic region , and the colors in the R@@ GB Far@@ ms , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and then click on info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to show my monitor , if I decided to work only at the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ming m ?
yes ! whether you work in the R@@ GB Far@@ ms or not , you need to work your monitor kal@@ li@@ bri@@ des since s@@ R@@ GB of it , therefore , you need to operate your monitor on s@@ R@@ GB , then you need either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile , or both .

this tool sets five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , final , automatic , and contrast to the menu Cor@@ rigi@@ ble Autom@@ atic correction automatically try out of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will scale the lumin@@ ous figures on the whole picture , allowing the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing color shades . this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
same : this method j@@ us@@ hes the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so the hist@@ ogram of the Inten@@ sity range is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in one image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright limit tones and j@@ us@@ ates the red , green and blue channels on the complete hist@@ ograms .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a re @-@ ending of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in shown images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; checking ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off @-@ out of a photo .
the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat confined to over a color @-@ bit , with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can perform too far from the original image , you can perform the white @-@ off mode , which is in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities are better to correction .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equivalent sal@@ vi@@ m of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start using the menu items white @-@ off of the image processing .
the showcase can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the pre@@ viewing of the target picture . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white , then it &apos;s enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right upstairs , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ escent values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ancy .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also download .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture @-@ show to use the color temperature of the white @-@ comparison . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ load indicator increases the colors when more than one color canal is over@@ exposed to the pixel . this will display the combined result in the white text . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as well as charging make exactly this . each attitude of the whit@@ eboard you have set , you can save it in a text file and then re@@ charge it later .
the button pres@@ ets puts all the filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral whit@@ eboard . note that also neutral settings will be a different photo than your original results . if you save it , your original picture will be changed .
you can set here the coding depth per color canal of the working image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widely spread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding requires even more plate , data time and is available on@@ ly@@ a for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as the handling of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors ton@@ ality correctly . this tool sets an integrated way to adjust multiple shades simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for audio files you will find further information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; checking effect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool has four work @-@ les effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of chemical processing was solar pol@@ arization , even Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when one gets partially developed pressure from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fin@@ ely .
the intensity controls the solar generation . with approximately 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally generates a neg@@ ativity that so does not produce on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar power effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and edit the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by giving the colors brilliant and gl@@ it@@ ating . try it easy to em@@ bell@@ ish lots of photos .
Vel@@ via is the market name for one in light @-@ optimised color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color with natural photography . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color but also some photographs , especially those who hardly ob@@ scure landscapes , too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contrac@@ ep@@ ts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ ite . in large pictures the filter can wi@@ pe all the CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counter@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice . also in this case , the tool for brightness is to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of raising them . all changes you can perform at the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog has worked very complicated for this tool , you need only the area of shooting . concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ograms .
the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity , a hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected range . beneath the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside , and which can be moved to change the intention of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to operate the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , updated by the settings of the picture . on the left @-@ hand side are the following options available .
scal@@ ding : with this selection box , it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . in pictures the large areas of a constant color include the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color brush can be used in the pre@@ viewing of the original image , in order to form the en@@ cla@@ ws of the shade , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
exit status : the withdraw@@ als allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ator which can be used to evaluate the evaluation inter@@ actively as in the input field . the compression of the exit can be used for example to create a detailed picture as the background to see while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the values are automatically set according to the image values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ es@@ ystem can be stored and later loaded again . the Gimp levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three shades , the input code is automatically re@@ activated for all shadows , funds and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the pre@@ viewing of the original image of the hist@@ ograms of red , green@@ - , blue and the lumin@@ ous channels .
the option over@@ load inde@@ xing indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input code applied to red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha canal , as well as the exit status are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left @-@ hand side , half of the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be refres@@ hed depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel changed from the module :
in addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
if you post@@ p@@ one a curve to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones with darker expressions , and that the associated pixel pixel are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change will be a suitable line on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is j@@ us@@ hed according to your taste .
save as well as charging : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each bend that you have created may have to be saved in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp short format .
if you want to use this method and the three colors of color buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the controls for the red , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ load inde@@ xing indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ous canal . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel con@@ bl@@ ender of the &amp; checking ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of the image editing .
with the can@@ al@@ ect@@ box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared with his own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to view the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are at the right bottom : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels . if you can also activate the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then creates the tool for generating magnificent black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me that comes from color @-@ coloured , which occurs from color canal . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ id converting it in which you reduce the color @-@ body first .
the store as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each mix@@ er setting allows you to save and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ load inde@@ xing indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ loaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was rest@@ ar@@ ted . the L@@ umin@@ ancy option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color pictures can simply be converted to the computer . also , with a set of film profile profiles .

green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lime filter . this looks good , with all the scenery paintings and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky . thus , like the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) founder .
orange fil@@ tered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film scre@@ aming with an or@@ derly lenses . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film scre@@ aming with a red liner filter . this creates dramatic parts @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar effects on the day @-@ time . thus , like the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lenses . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones , while he adds a bit of cold in the cup@@ board . this is very similar to the process of the p@@ ale of a pressure and re@@ development in an epi@@ thel@@ ium . this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and thus the 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
by checking out ; tool texture can apply decorative textures to one image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color @-@ image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the thrust of an old master , a pop @-@ screen portrait of enlarged points or like a wall @-@ screen on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is placed on 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; checking ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ et@@ ting eye . under picture frame can add the module from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you put the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly , the image is surrounded by a thin line , low line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , bot@@ tled water with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ cking effect and decorative fits a ornam@@ entation with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
this em@@ bell@@ ished with the frame it will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after side @-@ ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from color and drawing with its features as you need it . the larger the image , the larger must be the character set . at the end , you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . already the picture is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by checking out ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a sten@@ cil on a picture .
the menu picture Sch@@ abl@@ one uses in the image processing can be used to set scr@@ ot@@ ons over one image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) for reduction of file size . if you just want to add an e @-@ mail in English at the &amp; checking ; mail@@ ing@@ list checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil folders . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils has been set a construction view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . selecting a folder updated the preview of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview you are located three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your picture .
enlarge : this button is enlarged the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
down@@ stairs : this button shr@@ inks the underlying image . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the image and place it at the desired location .
ok if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; checking ; presents three different tools for ac@@ ut@@ eness . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for ac@@ ut@@ eness . it is very fast and easy , but also creates , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ary pictures .
the sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ pen@@ ed . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most of digit@@ alized images require a correction of ac@@ ut@@ eness . this in turn leads to a common colour combined with minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more in@@ toler@@ able shar@@ pen@@ ing as normal cameras for the private user .
in JP@@ EG pictures , a camera is often used in internal clarity . pictures in the raw format against it must always be used throughout the processing .
some sc@@ anners apply a shar@@ pen@@ al filter during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by raising a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing box . this allows you to call with the menu entry corpor@@ al shar@@ pen@@ alties .
you should deal with this , however , to deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , you will be able to focus on the menu entry . below Re@@ focus you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for ac@@ ut@@ eness .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ able . the solution that character@@ ize the image a bit soft , is much easier than to use it . use the tool for soft@@ marking with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ ble and experiment some with settings . the showcase on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help to edit the picture . the display window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ est mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats can produce close to sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel can be affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . you should therefore shar@@ pen@@ ed pictures at the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red picture which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the Corpor@@ a value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the apply difference . thus , it can define a minimum difference between the killing of the shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore beauty abnorm@@ alities in faces , Cel@@ ts and Water@@ grounds are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; checking out ; tool re@@ focus is focused on an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the fil@@ en@@ ary filter algorithm used by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can usually start better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice the circular f@@ ission works much better than the Gau@@ ck &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ck &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung will be influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should place 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red , but then heed to hal@@ ves .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values nearby 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
smokers can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.@@ 1 only rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will also consume the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ge Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch . this parameter is most often caused by a previously un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to be annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equally null , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the rob@@ bery filter .
matri@@ mon@@ y size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational atri@@ x . an increase in the height size can produce good results , especially if you choose huge values for the circular shar@@ ps or the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module will be very slow if you choose huge values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the store as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each of any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and Inten@@ sive architec@@ tures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than ac@@ ut@@ ches . this could be caused by un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger area used as ac@@ ut@@ ches .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color @-@ image has to be corrected . this picture was made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lenses .
for more information about the methods of ac@@ entr@@ al correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison of English under this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ th@@ tte sets the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened to create a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ te allows an adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the tool imaging body is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm used by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are enumer@@ ated below :
if you want to use the filtering settings for a j@@ us@@ hing you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
deta@@ il@@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a moderate smoo@@ th@@ ness over the image . weigh@@ ed value of 0.@@ 9 should give details so that no shar@@ pen@@ alties should be in@@ toler@@ able . please note that the deta@@ illed posture always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
rif@@ le dependency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes smoothly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie bas@@ kets or C@@ CD Rau@@ schen a high value will produce wav@@ y similar patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts will best be eliminated with a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of smoking inside your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it gets smoo@@ thes , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repetition : is often passed on as often the algorithm . usually here is 1 or 2 out .
Win@@ kel@@ p @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Win@@ kel@@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , there should also be small for a long term . thus , you should therefore select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral single step &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixels . you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels smoo@@ thing and never get bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the range of quality that you get by choosing this option is only low . however , it doubles the term . we recommend it to permit him .
the buttons are saved as well as charging exactly this . each adjustment of images can correct it in a text file and can be loaded again later .
the error error correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how picture bugs can be corrected with little arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that is used in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you can see there is a strange black ar@@ te@@ facts in the background that caused by a poor film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking was a very powerful tool to reduce the noise . it uses a protected algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool sets out sel@@ ectable images to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor @-@ smo@@ c from the camera or fashion ; -@@ effects of c@@ anned images of books or magazines .
if you need more information on Sens@@ or@@ rau@@ ts of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ kets that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you will only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay in default settings .
radius controls the size size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and may devast@@ ate the picture . the area indicated by the radius of the area moves over the image and the color in it gets smoo@@ th@@ ed and hence minor bugs .
ac@@ ut@@ eness : controls the focal point . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ stain from the filter to determine illumin@@ ating changes . if the value is increased , the adap@@ tive filter images can no longer obtain and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for ac@@ ut@@ eness . this value improves the frequency response of the fil@@ th . if it can be too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or smoke @-@ tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rob@@ bery or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ aires of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color @-@ tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to raise the toler@@ ances of the darker areas , which typically have rob@@ bery , to increase . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
absorption : controlled the adju@@ sting of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ red@@ dish . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther . if he is at his minimum , can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove noise rings and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ es@@ ystem and be loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ able for your purpose . the solution that character@@ ize the picture is much easier than a picture . use the tool for sof@@ tly labels with the menu entry , and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the showcase on the right side of dialogue display the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; checking ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo@@ ar@@ te@@ aser .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ der &apos;s smoking , cla@@ ws , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sive or retro@@ actively digital images to remove . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the images and thereby gets the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the algorithm is developed with another tool , the imaging body . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ st and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ment or quot ; arti@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting aims to correct these issues .
the buttons are saved as well as charging exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then be loaded again later .
photo Restau@@ ration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can also reduce as a photo with equ@@ ator smoking . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie filmed on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ul@@ arity on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan facts that were created by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos that have been included with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been used . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression across a built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright pixel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the ass@@ istants with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark &apos;s image directly following to discover new hot or bright pixels through c@@ CD def@@ ective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the correct image . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads again in the next session .
the picture section and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture . the showcase shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are taken up in all of the areas .
select an area to preview the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it will determine an average of the neighboring pixel . the color of this color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in block .
Kub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
below you can view the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ last@@ y is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. to correct corners , of an image .
fores@@ try lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the whole sensation area not ev@@ enly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( shady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that achie@@ ves the sensor there . teleph@@ ones may also show this behavior .
but he also has cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 out at the aper@@ ture filter , which means that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . far @-@ angle lenses should use , even with Center filter to use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise un@@ sharp@@ springs of movement arise .
with the big ins@@ ing areas of today &apos;s film and dy@@ e and video scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by sim@@ ulating an equi@@ valence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction is applied to one image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three re@@ trac@@ ts you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery and with three further expos@@ ing of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light weight damp@@ er at the point of the biggest density of the fil@@ ters . the default density is 2.@@ 0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with a aper@@ ture default of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the editing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction is reduced . you need to re@@ fine the exposure of the target image using these options , as you only need to increase positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more subtle re@@ vocation of the target image , let the values for illumin@@ ants / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; checking ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) displays the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance and contrac@@ tion was also performed with the image using this tool .
the &amp; checking was a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second counts is dealt with the general geom@@ etric distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conc@@ exe form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ p but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to that of the second count . if you combine these two , any geom@@ etric distor@@ tion can be eliminated virtually .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second count . with negative values , sound @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values ho@@ ver@@ ical distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the fourth gra@@ des . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; corners parameter &quot; has the opposite character of the parameter General .
z@@ oom : this value indicates the size of the size and thus leads the correction of the first gra@@ des by . negative values increase while positive the image is reduced .
brigh@@ ten : this value increases the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correc@@ tions . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ n@@ - or ho@@ ver@@ b correction should be performed prior to all assignment or size changes . best to carry out this correction as all the first . if you want to re@@ ap a picture and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction is available to you . move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the dot@@ ted lines . move it to an important place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ n@@ - / ver@@ b @-@ shaped distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you are correct a ver@@ b @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting picture is black corners . you can remove these with the cut @-@ cut tool in the menu trans@@ figuration from the image processing or via z@@ oom Re@@ aders to this dialogue .
for most images the tone @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate inf@@ rar@@ ed film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter reproduced the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window , you can choose the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set film bas@@ kets and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ deur texture of a highly sensitive movie . ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of footage and the dominance of paint green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter colors for the reproduce of inf@@ rar@@ ed film mix , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of inf@@ rar@@ ed fil@@ me@@ tic effect applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ ws .
the &amp; checking was a simple to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the makers mix large silver bas@@ kets of the photo enlargement .
the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to release a timeless atmosphere of daily life . if you want to use this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight specially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequent higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the cinem@@ atic effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity also corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; checking ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and style life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brus@@ hes between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for large images . smooth controls controls the smoo@@ th@@ tte or , from the other side view the uniqueness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and working with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and Sm@@ oo@@ se@@ tte 17 .
the &amp; checking was used ; filters coal @-@ drawing used color - and Inten@@ sity gra@@ dient to generate a carbon bacteria . the lines whose gra@@ dient is slowly changing and therefore is not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top rider select the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ ates the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ tte ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adju@@ sting the intention .
the &amp; checking ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stolen in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filtration group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is seen by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ e@@ mo@@ cks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass@@ blo@@ kes .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filtration group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of shar@@ pen@@ fe effects . it uses the protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ shar@@ fe : caught the image along the s@@ cent@@ red lines that go from a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ shar@@ fe : caught the image by rotation of the pixels for a focal point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
distance un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
movement @-@ shar@@ per : caught the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moti@@ ons , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft tones : caught the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or add a warm and subtle light .
fl@@ atter@@ ing sharp@@ ness : caught the image by random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulated the un@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ per : find the d@@ arbe@@ et in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural your pictures a great appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows the size of the tropical size to change . as the dri@@ ppers are not automatically reduced with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size and density of the drops . fish change the op@@ tic effect of the drop in the picture .
you can use the &amp; checking ; image editing an area free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay free . if you start after the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the range will be free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirror or spin into the right orientation . the tools in this menu can be found in the menu trans@@ crip@@ tive rotation or transformations .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture is smaller . the big question is , how can you blow up an image and bl@@ ush the details ? how can you invent the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to pick the pixels . if you want to enlarge a little picture with a better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the Image team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider new size and are enumer@@ ated below :
aspect ratio retained : if this setting is activated , the input of the new size remains the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it gets smoo@@ thes , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons are saved as well as charging are used exactly . each one can enlarge for photo may be stored as a text file , and then be loaded again later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load down@@ wards . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard aug@@ mentation .
cutting a photo is not only a commonly guided surgery but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile a picture . image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull off the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse .
when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photographs will be cut out . thus , you will get a good overview of how your photo will change after the cutting area . you can change the size of the area navig@@ ated by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle generate simply using the left mouse button .
once you are happy with the cut @-@ cut , use the button The Zu@@ k@@ schnei@@ der button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or file Save under the File File to save the photo cut .
in the screening area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
in the tool Up aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to width .
the tool does not use relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal to whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of dialogue there are two buttons on the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertical .
in the dialog section , you can set up the max. relationship with the max . cut the area to the highest possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation .
the tool After side @-@ ratio crop the settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the assignment tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected the image cut and not the original image .
the settings of contrac@@ tion assistance allow help to fade , so that you can put your pictures better together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of similarity . as the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden middle is a divi@@ der on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us snail or the leaf sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already been used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used their temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times if you put your pictures , buildings and even photographs to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number direc@@ ts itself from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures . one composition that is usually follows as visual .
the golden middle provides fluids relief lines if you put together a picture . these help are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden spiral will bring your target good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s view along the line of the spiral and creates an asymm@@ etrical visual flow .
another rule is called the right corner of the golden spiral , also called Golden justification . it should be used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this one can just be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden triangles are also derived from the above mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden justification . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not a tiny tri@@ ght triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frames , you create an effect of using professional photo@@ graphs dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that the camera is not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things turned to a corner . you can repair this with the instrument ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to trans@@ duce Free Rot@@ ation and j@@ us@@ hing the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can put the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right at the top .
for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cursor in the picture @-@ show around the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , click the angle as described in previous section .
after you turned out a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair is to utilize the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the auto @-@ cutting edge . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smoo@@ thes the picture a bit of the rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ ical transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview will then automatically be re@@ charged . on the right side of dialogue , you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area .
angle on the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area .
after adaptation of the perspective , the picture becomes a little lubric@@ ated . for individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you will get in@@ consp@@ ic@@ able tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to hide this is to cut the picture with transformations from the image processing .
the switching tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module through transform@@ ers .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by pressing the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press at preference , the angle on zero is reset . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are shown on the right of the display .
to your help will end a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after having done the p@@ adding , the picture is caught a bit . for a single switch , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shades produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the image with transform@@ ative access from the image processing .
&amp; checking ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iles were comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; checking ;
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F below .
&amp; checking ; shows only files in formats which knows . this occurs in the list of file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file editing ; you can change this list of file formats . in paragraph configuration you will find more information .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras even allow you to choose to use format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; checking ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression proceedings on digital images . in this way redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JP@@ EG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss , if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw format , you can read in Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert the Roh@@ format pictures in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the shell format of &amp; checking ; convert . in the configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; checking ; .
&amp; checking ; supports the charging images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was included in &amp; checking ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; checking ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are frequently saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but it &apos;s not a film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a film @-@ file , then the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play films to play the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module is a series of images exported into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you change the steps 4 and 5 you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four lines with the module white .
many tools that you need the photo editing are available in &amp; checking ; contain your description here .
all image processing tools such as raising , soft characters , smo@@ kes@@ hi@@ fting , re@@ focus , blur@@ red mas@@ king , the effect is applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ ly quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right indicates the filter to be applied to the area right of the selected preview area .
horizontal share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the under@@ e displays the filter to be applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertically split . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the top section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; M@@ ouse about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the field and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ score . the colors used can be adjusted within the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the image and disc@@ ard it on the part of the picture , from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower right corner : here is a help and possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ ts from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features displays essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is an intuitive card tool , based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can press and post@@ p@@ one with the mouse @-@ wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this is naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and use colors .
the p@@ allets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in a dialogue palette , you can select from a list of p@@ allets , or browse the files to files .
the cursor is displayed in the pal@@ chain view as a line . it can be moved by che@@ ating on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described below the palm view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select such a choice , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the cross @-@ area subsi@@ dy is activated , the color is inserted from the color board at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different one ; depending on whether the mode is selected to write . this mode can be set by re@@ writing the cross area under Bei@@ ge C@@ ursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the promotions , cutting and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , in case a further color follows . if there are three sequence values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;

&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing and graph@@ ed ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ ene are available in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; software program to visu@@ alize Graph@@ ene ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; cold program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing and graph@@ ically ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ p ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an application has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change of graphs in &amp; Kate ; graph@@ ene re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphs at &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs at &amp; k@@ graph ; in a &amp; Kate ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than this no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which requires the &amp; graphical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; needed for the presentation of graphs . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the strings . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special , left and right at the pressing &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been changed in &amp; k@@ graph ; loaded file from another program is displayed , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; if your decision will also be noted , you can set your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings box ; set up , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i outside of an ongoing &amp; c@@ graphical viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ graphical viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph@@ ene graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
during the start @-@ up , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
when you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph , which are to be inserted on one side , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the particular parts of the graph .
page preview of one on several pages shared graphs without header line and with another font .
the page again store gives the possibility to specify the behavior if a file is changed on the disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time .
the page opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; c@@ graphical viewer ; if a graph opens outside a running session . you can open a default behavior for that case ( the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is being asked .
the page administration page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can define a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or decide at any start after it .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or s@@ worn representations of targeted graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few can@@ oe trips .
the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for odd graphs . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ ray model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a jumping @-@ spr@@ ing@@ model layout . it uses the Fru@@ den@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ edge sa@@ vi@@ ers for the treatment of large and car@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm prescribed the knot@@ s circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or even the graphs with a filter change before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ eri@@ zed ) and uses the standard algorithm for each type of ( dot ; for orient@@ ated , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ feared graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse @-@ cursor . click with this mouse @-@ cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to obtain additional help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source folder .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special institution is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the menu settings you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five parts : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for strings , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette , and the grid net in which you draw the icon .
creates a new symbol . if the current file changes , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon will be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew .
represents the last und@@ one step back again . if you do not have a step down , this function is disabled .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the icon @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ;
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , they show you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current string , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colours of the symbol .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialogue with the three sides templates for symbols , background and symbolic grid .
with the buttons ... , Edit ... and Dele@@ te you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or display lin@@ e@@ ale and put one chess board as a Transpar@@ ency indication . you can also adjust for the chess@@ board the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Groß as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images can be found in order to read new images and to save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
pictures sc@@ atter@@ y : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the SAN@@ E project or another source like e.g. video streams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SAN@@ E .
when you scan the menu item , you will open a dialog that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . click here the source of which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click with the button scanning the picture . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
be sure that the window will be completely displayed , as some settings are not displayed otherwise .
after you have pushed down the button to scan , you will have to wait until scan , and the window will specify the options for the target picture . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the picture saved .
screen photos lets you generate after you have selected import and screen@@ shot ... you have selected a window in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window selected is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can check other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible work@@ station . if you choose to read the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long the screen@@ shot will be waiting before it starts . if you turn on other working areas , you should choose this delay highly enough to get the time to navigate .
once the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog options of the target picture with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS @-@ coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinator , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and lati@@ tu@@ fts are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mats . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above dialog window appears then . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a sp@@ ur@@ file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded in the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation performed the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time . this is why cam@@ az@@ eit must be re@@ funded with GMT . this can be done with time zone . click here your camera time@@ zone .
the maximum time for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ az@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation underneath , the data is assembled . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add the images . the difference between 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. may be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality an loc@@ ation is located in a large number of difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same site . as the dialog can use the coordinates from one call to next , you just have to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found and set up with the shown map and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the map can always be manually changed between card mode , satellite images and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script used that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums created as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the drawing will be UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ chmarks and the text that will appear in the HTML page appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you then click on a picture a new page is opened in the picture . otherwise , the picture will appear directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . select a folder in which you have a writing process . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected JP@@ EG @-@ file format , the EX@@ IF information will also be stored in the new images .
with other color @-@ depth , you can change the standard colour @-@ depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the riders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; riders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small pictures displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window indicates the user as far the action is . push the break to break the process .
if the module generated the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program@@ er to determine if errors occur during the generation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the preview of the gallery . push the module to complete the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture concerned is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ ung@@ chter allows it to watch a selection of pictures and perform on them ground@@ oper@@ as like tor@@ ches , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short shots and mouse clicks . it was developed for a quick screening and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss module is a tool to change images without compromising quality .
this module allows to save the images below , images in the JP@@ EG format without the usual loss of quality and met@@ adata .
the consequence of the loss of storage is to increase the file size , as no compression of the color information takes place , e.g. in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera click is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you would like to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file you want to copy it into the main program and then call the file expres@@ sive dialog with which you want to copy the target picture . the data is copied after which you have pushed for the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not to each target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ er module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can insert a basic images . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the Sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures that are to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can launch the module using ex@@ tras , MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images that you have selected are then enumer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . in case you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which will specify a picture . the speed of the picture will be specified below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast to a very smooth image change .
the background @-@ color can be set next next . in doubt you should have it black . the name and path of the generated file you can set under name of the MPEG output file . keep it as possible as the extension possible .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your needs , you can go to the production of the movie right now . depending on the speed of your host you can drink coffee or in all the rest of your machine and enjoy the slides when you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along with standard photo@@ box . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : sensible to enhance you or print the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM , respectively convert .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original county of Him is : await from d@@ cra@@ w that it does not produce the same results as the software from your cam@@ er@@ ulation . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Bild@@ kon@@ verter window appears then in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ fine the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether camera pres@@ ets can be used for the whit@@ eboard . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on .
a quadru@@ ple @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss of loss of your image .
if you plan to use your pictures often or later on , you should not select the JP@@ EG format since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ated . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ adata that included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to ab@@ ort this process again , you can use this break .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . use this mode so if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar is not available on how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images into an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , the star@@ tup and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the can be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick Package . you can shr@@ ink or enlarge the picture . you can add four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal magnitude in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : sizes change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
un@@ proportional : not proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : preparing the image for the photo pressure . the user can set up the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . further pictures can be taken on the list of the images to be deleted and disc@@ ard it there .
after which you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add additional pictures with a file expres@@ sive dialog . for the last shown picture a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the pictures list and disc@@ ard it to add the list of the images to be sent .
with the button to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of shown images .
after you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected are already attached as attachment .
don &apos;t be careful to send out too many images to once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions to the size of the emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to modify the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and once again used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures will be added to the images in a text file , and the mail has been created .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under loss of loss formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . therefore , you should use P@@ NG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and are the original files in JP@@ EG format , then the original random data are added to the stated pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages , looking for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button shot you can sh@@ it this window ? en .
after launching the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are enabled very elegant image @-@ passes through OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate Grap@@ hi@@ k@@ card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option fil@@ en@@ ames indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower right corner during the presentation will be displayed .
the option loop is that the presentation will be displayed in an end @-@ off loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ cape .
the option pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it will not be the order of the images used in the album .
under del@@ aying between the pictures the time gap between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect . so you should check this out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , choose another effect between images .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide .
on the left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ames , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ hing is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the work@@ surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE work@@ surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; cold photo ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , then in any group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries are available .
in the browser window you can see the categories that you have provided information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for itself .
if you press with the mouse to the entry people changes the view of the browser . see picture .
if you choose another person you will only see the images on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures to a few more images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can display with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ b album ; however , for each person a private appearance , this applies naturally also for places , keywords , and other categories you have defined yourself . see this picture .
to view images beside the names , select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no suitable images for your keywords ) .
you need to define yourself which picture is displayed for each individual person . to do this , you have to see the image editor &apos;s window ( in more detail ) and select the image editor you can see in the picture . here you can choose the enlar@@ ging factor according to your needs and thus select which part of the picture is to be displayed and cut off .
when you call on the entry window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the place of the image properties . this dialog can be seen on the picture again .
if you enter a string into the field lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tures and descriptions of images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however , are not shown in Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the manual book for &amp; k@@ b album ; . if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try out more functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photographs , and check out the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ iel album ; and choose in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ b album ; for the first time start , or select the menu Help menu entry album . as a result , some example photos are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; cold photo .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photograph album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photographs , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you multiple different time units . each list then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used on the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture will appear in the preview display ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently shown images if you can navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time information , drag . if you choose one area , you will preview images of this period . you can break the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ iel album ; introduces you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photographs , integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user hand , integrated version is described , which you can call on the HTML menu HTML ... call .
before HTML @-@ Pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the cover and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later . on cold photo ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ b album ; export file should be created on the overview page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be shown . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . note that all pictures are exported from a party . note that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this option to hide certain images from certain amount .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look . most settings are obvious why this is not specifically made .
at the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can search your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , if he would like to see a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and URL to where your website is stored .
best to choose all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you have to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored automatically and next time you can choose the location . here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if they really choose all of the viewer . if you have created for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you will need to copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , correctly will you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all the sub@@ folders are .
the currently described settings have been related all three to basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you set to the output folder .
in case you are on a family @-@ party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photographs , come together , you might want to create a HTML @-@ page for viewing the images . if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to go with &amp; k@@ photograph album ; this work does not yet again .
with &amp; k@@ b album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your data base . the Bil@@ de@@ co@@ operatives will be imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ if the images are stored in the file , or if in the file you can save all images to the file . however , the advantage is able to pass all images to the file , and this file will be able to pass it independently . however , the obvious downside is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the file extern@@ als ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this becomes an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in a two @-@ way . first , the images are not found , so the images are displayed in the .@@ k@@ im file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for the export of images described you can call on the Ex@@ por@@ e menu ... call .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when using manual , near the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atic option to copy Autom@@ atically near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ b album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures are already compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not comp@@ ress the files to comp@@ ress . if you want to do this nevertheless , simply select the option export file comp@@ ress .
the latest option of this site is maximum size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by example , that each image should be up to 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... it will be imported &amp; k@@ iel album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to import is made up of four steps . first , you must choose which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alise the category people of the imported file , while this category is called on your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories do they correspond in your database .
in the fourth step you can specify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to watch pictures from a different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash . if you want to see pictures of your Italy &apos;s holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass the different steps from the ( 1 ) fixed information about your images , via ( 2 ) the transparency and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adaptation options .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . but it was extended and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ iel album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photographs album : see the folder in which your images are stored and uses it automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photographs , then another folder tree with images , you can launch &amp; k@@ b album ; using the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
about the menu entry settings box , set up to a window , with which you can change the settings from &amp; k@@ photograph album ; in the following section of the user hand , you will find the different settings options .
left you see six different symbols that you can preview and call the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing on the F1 @-@ button and click on the desired option .
in it , you describe how you can set different characteristics for each image , e.g. people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
on the way you see dialogue being used to already edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options you can set complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained .
in view of the setup options available to you for fixing the member groups . with the above listed selection list , you can choose the category you want to configure . in the left window , a list of the current category and in the right contains a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photographs album : shares his module with other graphic applications , such as checking and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called by the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photographs , but are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules itself .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photographs . therefore , you should use new modules first with the demo database ; demo database you can either call via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photograph album / demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; cold photo album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage , if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photographs album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; cold photo .
thereby sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photographs album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the images that show you the picture @-@ look at the moment .
apart from the current album &amp; k@@ photographs album , the modules also have to pass on a list of albums . here is a photo album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ iel album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each item gives an album an album for the module .
or it will be the category you specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , you use the category people , will do &amp; k@@ b album ; so do if you have selected individuals to believe and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; cold photo album ; not compatible are you able to remove these from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select the area modules , which modules are to be loaded .
in the picture you can see an example of a picture screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ icks album ; start your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , you &apos;ll see the window looking at the window , with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will not return to this window , but now click on the entry to show you an overview with all the existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photographs album ; is the possibility to see any picture taken on the picture , where the picture was recorded , etc . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images given certain notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view of three lists using a text@@ box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photographs , as you will always use them again when you enter information on your pictures .
the following idea is based on the moving pictures within the list : if you are looking for example a family party and on all 50 images , the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are pic@@ tured , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and arrange the people faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected any notes for each image separately , you would like to edit all selected images and add these images to your notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right at the top .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all those images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in California , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
in the picture you see a browser window of the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the appropri@@ ating di@@ ver it is possible to add an entry to a existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category and disc@@ ard it to make this sub@@ category of this item . attention , this requires that you sort of your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the locking di@@ ver by forming the bar , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by using it outside the window range .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... , which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to display this window later again , use the button options ... and here window will be shown . you can see this process in the picture .
when you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply looking down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . simply try it .
if you are using a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture . if you do not have a window opened with a picture , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images from the picture below . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , or select either the Dele@@ te button or select the edit menu . well , the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ iel album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; cold photo ; i.e. images may also use without you saved on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the pictures from the disk . in the picture you can view the images from the hard disk .
pictures , in which the right upper edge is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nail pictures are present , so that the preview of these images can be displayed . however , you can &apos;t see these pictures with the image concerned .
as you may see this feature that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it again . if you want to avoid trouble as the mess of your images , please buy a bigger hard disk in order to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to pass a little more privacy , you will want to block the pictures that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click on update . alternatively , you can also view all the images that may see your little sister , s@@ cour@@ ing and block the menu All except current view .
this makes you set what pictures are to be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to block your laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu item that you have locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered into the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy .
remember that this picture protection is not very safe . for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other anyone who can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file , password as un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this kind of password protection serves only to those who are with &amp; cold album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures .
the reason you all want to see all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photographs ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to look at some point . for this reason , has a photo album ; for this reason , has a photo album ; above a picture _ and video concerned . you can preview this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it is of course showing the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily configure the mouse and put anywhere else . you can also configure the information displayed and whether information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . you can see the icon @-@ click below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here to view the browser , see the matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
in case you load multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons image high and picture down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ b album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing the str@@ g button and plus or minus . it will be stopped and stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful skill to the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ b album ; it is in the screen mode to switch . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to the screen mode and back .
when you use the spect@@ ator you can pull in the image and pull out zo@@ oming . with the mouse button you can pull the mouse button down again . with the minus key you can turn r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not drawn zo@@ omed . with the same key the zo@@ oms puts the zo@@ oms so that each pixels on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will function in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and M@@ inu@@ x key .
with the screen@@ savers from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it may happen that you will have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the Canc@@ el and Con@@ figuration dialog of the picture open to those names . you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and highlight them as good or bad as you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letters . in view , you will see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can press characteristics to the images by selecting the letters for the feature , after the picture was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ b album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to view a picture on the painted area . to turn off the painting mode from the context menu ; then , please select the painting from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not completely master but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the lens section and visu@@ alize the object in the wire views .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously , but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following set menu ends , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , edit or from the right @-@ click menu , you can never remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click the user to take over these changes . if you typ@@ ed invali@@ d values , a message with a error message appears . then you can correct the error errors and returns to the application or change the changes associated with abor@@ tion .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using the help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a pre@@ viewing view .
press a preview in Fe@@ atur@@ ts view and a small example of the scene is made with the selected texture . if you want to have selected the whole texture , even if you wish only one part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cris@@ p locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these lines with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a range of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the super@@ ordinate object or as absolute value . objects will only be shown if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as a default . the object tree and the view of the object divi@@ ding are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need another order , you can adjust it as you like . you can also save multiple wind@@ arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window on or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views about one another , drag the starter right onto a different view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the car@@ rot @-@ card top in the views .
the final possible window order are pig views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop , or click on the little to the left above @-@ top arrow in the fibre bar .
to conclude a view , click on the little cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the shot , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you can find entries for any type of views . new views are sc@@ iss@@ ful , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders the symbol rendering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full pictures in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu View modes ... choose the following dialog box :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets the characteristics of the mode be recognized .
in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the reduced image . if you only want to rent a small area of the image , select the cros@@ sover section and enter the picture @-@ out section for rendering into the input field .
in the combination of quality , you can select the characteristics which &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering uses . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user re@@ flexi@@ ve lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user hand@@ book to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is made with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or pattern @-@ effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the impact of these errors . generally , see pictures with this feature better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ uted and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ rent loop depends on the calculated colour .
when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam on pixels . if you set the difference between tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between color values divided the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion you can adjust with the depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smoke for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changing &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which is comp@@ uted diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this tab map , you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays did not hit the object .
opens a new window for display the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu entry file import ... and select in dialogue window a file .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete command @-@ cat@@ cher by &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if any error messages or warnings occur , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Be@@ gin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object to import objects in the scene , just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ amed . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in self @-@ setting view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for shown object . here , you will find the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire @-@ models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
you can set the object catch of points on the r@@ aster menu in the context menu of the wire model view . you can adjust here the em@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ ali@@ zations and rot@@ ations .
larger values results in a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the shown objects , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the details separately for two directions .
when you cross the high details loyal to advanced proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections using exceptions of the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you browse the wall , a wall behind the objects is rounded off . the wall is shown in a chess boards from two single @-@ adjustable colors .
when you display soil , a ground below the objects is rounded off . the floor is shown in a chess boards from two single @-@ adjustable colors .
if you activate Kan@@ ten@@ smoo@@ thes , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
this page allows you to modify existing window arrangements or create new window systems . in the section window arrangements , you can create and save window arrangements .
the combin@@ ation@@ field standard window displays : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Dele@@ te .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be added to add and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ its anchor the window below the existing window , with car@@ rot map , you will get a single card view along with the previous view and spot@@ ting the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just arrived &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate , simple scene , among beginners , very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program to first use , you should note these important rules :
if you have no camera set , no rules for ren@@ ders are being applied as a result you will receive a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you only receive a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the following set of windows :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu edit . therefore , you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you generate . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera in View checks can change with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button application or input button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene , for example , you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting extension body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a per@@ tin@@ ent method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button application or input bar . in the object tree the new name is instantly displayed .
the wire model view also shows the level , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level increases up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can check the entry for the floor if you click on the icon at the bottom of the object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : scal@@ ding , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise an unity below the horizon line , just allow you to get acquainted with some of these parameters . select shift and place the values as below :
first select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the pre@@ viewing of pig@@ ments shows just a mat@@ ured black material , because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , you always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the pig@@ ment . also , there are many options now , but now take the simplest .
if you do not preview color on qu@@ ader and ball , please click on the user &apos;s button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you want to ren@@ ders your picture now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results :
of course , this is not the colour . you will have to enter two new attributes . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called it . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree each time , and change the colors in the view of the obj@@ ectivity :
this step should you already be able to execute simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as simple as the floor :
in the view of obj@@ ectivity , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to press ) so the ball has float over the ground as you have moved the ground round a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering results now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball surface appears as a black black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select one single color and set the values as below :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some Finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the buttons or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ y@@ y@@ z is a cr@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the Ren@@ derer die hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , which reflects the scenes ) by every pixel and broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect as for example fog . thus , the scene is edited pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you view the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously any scene , which is to be e@@ ased , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu , replacing the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage space .
presents the scene in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you haven &apos;t been stored in the scene yet .
repeated the last one command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing options .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new dialog with this option for &quot; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the machine tool . you can add and remove this option tool@@ tip for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to carry out non @-@ smoking surface without changing any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etric form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for texture map .
fundamental bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens , or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , using a picture @-@ file as a color card .
&amp; Br@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture @-@ concerned and browser browser . the application has a file browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or screen mode .
the use of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with Click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button return .
you can set whether any picture should be displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures are always the same windows to use .
if you are looking for a specific file , enter the first characters in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable file name appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; ess@@ c .
in dialogue - &amp; sp@@ y show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , shor@@ eline for the display window and shor@@ eline for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; sp@@ y show ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; sp@@ y show ; in passing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , you will open the browser window , this folder in the browser window .
click the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; sp@@ y show ; to set up , that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged for the display window on the full screen . this option is enabled as a default setting .
sets out whether the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the picture change with a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it will be interrupted by the user . to enter the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; sp@@ ick@@ show ; in the box maps shor@@ eline for the display window and shor@@ eline for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
shows small symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
shows thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
res@@ ized the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is more open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling code is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; Show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; checking ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; checking ; project .
&amp; Show@@ photo ; is a quick picture editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ ens ; it &apos;s a show@@ room photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to its part at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; Show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report any mistakes or possible improvements . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can just follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; Show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ rooms , then we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ rooms , and hopefully soon we will answer questions of other users . however , in this mailing list , English language is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
the best way to get involved in the show@@ down photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ rooms .
&amp; Show@@ photo ; try to give you so much control over your working procedures as possible . to access these settings , you need to set up the menu settings show@@ down ; setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color which is displayed when the lower or over@@ load indicator should be selected . skill wise should show the colors with what you are supposed to show , contrast . sub@@ jug@@ ation should display a bright color and over@@ load a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ rooms has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and actions to the selected images . the same page bar you can also find in the image processing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that does not make more than scan and storing images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and storing images , which no longer makes a dialog to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display images in front of the file .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the use scanner and press OK to open the scanner . exit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
to make a picture , the user can only start a preview , and then scan for the final scan . the preview can be launched by the preview button .
in order to select the image better the user can get into the image and out of the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the complete preview fits the window .
if the picture is selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a showcase , as shown below is displayed . when storing pressed , then the image becomes saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a break and you will come back to the main window .
by the button Settings , the description will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user may consider the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be displayed on saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be deduc@@ ted .
this setting allows them to select the way as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog to store for each image opens the dialog before each sub@@ named folder . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically store with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to save yourself without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored at the option save without having stored after a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as a standard for dialog to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ tention images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical su@@ ff@@ ix of each time when a picture is stored . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
the user can adapt the quality of your image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help will start the KDE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button On the KDE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs key@@ boards . below you can set a list of these cut@@ ters and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select shor@@ eline .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands . this makes your keyboard on the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also available in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP &apos;s function could &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so the user ID , why a script does not run .
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
folder / templates will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly realize that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which each KDE installation should be attached .
most scripts allow to run outside programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple can be inv@@ oked . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , strings passed on the default script . for this reason , scripts should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to view the setup dialog . to store and loading the setup data , any script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ sets the work@@ folder in the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script could now &amp; b ; using D@@ COP @-@ functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signal a change of volume . the new volume is an inte@@ ger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ary P@@ AT@@ H@@ s contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry . sub@@ menu and item@@ Tit@@ le are also handed over to use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ alena Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu _ Tit@@ le ) . to add an entry back to d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok is termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example the storing of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks &apos;s script can also install script packages that the user &amp; b ; downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which allows the user to detect the archive clearly as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extending amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to @-@ loaded modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll side of &amp; Amar@@ ok . attached . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has a lot of useful and powerful functions and is nonetheless surprising to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can easily drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title of thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collectors browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which to hear ? then the playlist browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many other audio systems can be used so that S@@ IE can be looking for , how you want to hear your music . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew !
usually one has to enter into the basic folder of Amar@@ ok sources the following : to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ ok .
there &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used you should do not have any difficulty . if you encounter problems , please report this to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that can enable or disable for the compile @-@ time point with the configure script or disable them . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system conditions .
activ@@ de@@ bug@@ ging de@@ bug@@ ging . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set without any effort on the setup dialog . the furnis@@ hing dialog has several car@@ p cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
player window display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists will be available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . the option turns the experimental function of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stimm@@ ungs@@ bar@@ ometer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tuning full : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
voting files in the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . otherwise , the .@@ 00 files are stored in the settings of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ 00 files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok . ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok , will be started when a browser is needed .
use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list .
playlist saving , save the current playlist automatically when entering &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you do not want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , use from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
the actual piece can be seen in change @-@ change , that the play@@ lists window opened up / ab@@ rol@@ ment to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when changing to the context @-@ browser displays automatically the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the section appearance you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s appearance can be adjusted . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different scriptures in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set by mark@@ ings of Ac@@ ene Scrip@@ tures . you can select writings for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press on excer@@ pts ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom @-@ defined color scheme , you own the tor@@ ment of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the most activated color short@@ cut for front and background color .
re@@ viewing the start is that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start playing the play@@ back automatically with the piece on the spot , with whom she stopped working with the final conversion .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display set allows you to switch the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the OS@@ D will appear and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Cho@@ ose ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cros@@ sover shade causes the text in OS@@ D sha@@ ded .
own colors will give you the possibility to adapt the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to color choices . if suit@@ ably colors do not use , the pre @-@ presented &amp; k@@ ills is used .
the input field display text presents the text shown in the OS@@ D . through the type of space hal@@ ters the OS@@ D can be adjusted to its own needs . below , you can find a list of available space card and what they mean .
the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to decide on which screen a multi @-@ suite monitor environment should appear on the OS@@ D .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further inser@@ tion in this cart card .
the sample card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ field next to his name . this section also includes ti@@ cking fields to place as with the selected folders .
sub@@ folders recur@@ sively search : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed and its sub@@ folders to be followed by music .
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search will be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : results that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) adds to your collection . the automatically added playlist will then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part of collecting database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ational field drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another facility is needed in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql establishment .
the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : the machine is typ@@ ed on which the My@@ S@@ ql database . then , under port : the net@@ port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced .
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the Car@@ bu@@ cket last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can provide the names of split pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performer calls for activation : after activation of this attitude is called &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ts to the each play . note : you can not see the list in context @-@ browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok requires just the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the programs included in it , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the OS@@ D pre@@ dict that your window manager considers the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . therefore , Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are providing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library to days . you can fin@@ alize this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and let the collection go again .
mostly , this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the Met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , just try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit mat@@ ured .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . in case B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this results in editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off automatic . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common lap@@ se and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because there are many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ inf@@ os , but they do not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v = 0 &#93; ) ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script required the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons are always active in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) . this is a known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status De@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a icon that shows up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ .@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify yourself at the easiest way through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ che@@ en@@ vy .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you have something on the rec@@ ti@@ fying of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted into the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist . click with the playlist and select column display . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short sub@@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist to the folding menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop them there exactly as you would do with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to add @-@ button , is the button playlist load . click on it .
probably you &apos;re lacking the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . new . take a look after li@@ b@@ ish , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( about the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar at ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . G@@ stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG !
it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 @-@ Dek@@ or will be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos; s from : - )
if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to reach simultaneously audio . this can be achieved through a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) .
the output of this command should help you find a problem and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ cription ) .
this is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media should first de@@ codi@@ fy . G@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ cor with little over@@ head . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to Al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . select sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next item of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying the sound bu@@ ffer in your Al@@ sa @-@ furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to obtain the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ per@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine drivers has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller of the bu@@ ffer , the less contracts react the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ stre@@ amer you need to register all the components . execute G@@ ST register to register all of your streams .
read the G@@ uns FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg download , compile and install it . then execute the module folder of G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you can find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
please report from you under bu@@ zz@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is this already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm to the command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the play@@ back . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will have wo@@ ken up by the soft tones of the music that you stopped before going to bed .
how can one know the current one in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ongoing titles when one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you performer and title of the running piece by : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok , window . press this d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button represents a piece in the queue in the queue . by pressing the input button according to a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search is reset .
ok , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how about the icon in the system section of the Control bar ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ MB@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can choose which browsers are to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and appear on the console a lot of error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to use ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click on Audio CD . it opens a file @-@ browser with multiple folders . you can switch to the wa@@ v file , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code instead , instead , files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Lau@@ rel ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result .
you can fill the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a sp@@ readsheet in the playlist window . there you can select the evaluation of a piece just as you click , select : review or press F@@ 2 . you can edit the rating also in the dialog met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to present you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed release plan that is not associated with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok , but some users can certainly find annoying . disable the option symbol when playing anim@@ ate in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool to set up and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create a separate . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... image @-@ image context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too much . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ quer@@ or Navigation area allows you to monitor control and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok while in the context of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; then click the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add to Amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to information on what pieces will be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ername and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use Al@@ sa , please use the latest version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ ks and therefore also a lot of error messages .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you have to configure &amp; install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are installed . you now have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to compile and install .
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ational . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer with no p@@ rel@@ ational . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : use@@ d@@ ne no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I consider the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ amer , must be installed alongside g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer quick@@ time .
you will receive the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system manager G@@ ST register . then you start Amar@@ o@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ ok setup ... audio output enter the device . typically , B. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ smar@@ .@@ p@@ inch &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ect@@ l@@ .@@ smar@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b / 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b / 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b / W : 1 &quot; } ect@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual @-@ mix device , you disable the tick on sound card , supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio issue with Arts will not be further supervised . you can of course take this problem by yourself in your hand ! if you like , you can make the new so urgently required super@@ visor for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you do not like to update your collection , or the assistant simply does not like , then this quick start guide will help you . with her help you &amp; Amar@@ ok have set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . pull your mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . enter something in the text@@ box . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it by using the button playlist , you can save this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this playlist to the playlist . if the playlist is activated in the folder of your collection , then these play@@ lists are already activated in the construction view . with a right click on a playlist you will get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select an audio CD in the menu bar , please select a file browser with multiple folders and CD @-@ pieces in the W@@ AV format . drag the W@@ AV files into the playlist and then push the button down .
the audio CD function uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is available in the playlist . simply click with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have various options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . also , some additional packages are listed below , which make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . just like any normal multimedia player has a player window with the most important functions . additionally , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the playlist window contains several browsers to record and browse your entire music collection .
in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre . at the top of the window there is a run @-@ click display , which shows the current ongoing play or the currently running stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already exp@@ ired game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a choice of audio analy@@ zers , even below the run @-@ click display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer may be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the tre@@ ad display , the buttons and E@@ Q is also activated or de@@ activated by the PL window , de@@ activated the play@@ lists windows , while the E@@ Q is used for mounting E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the play@@ back @-@ buttons , the volume @-@ volume and the piece of posi@@ tional shooting . use the sli@@ ders to start the piece position or the volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can start playing / stop and jump to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Classi@@ cal to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer display ex@@ tras from the main menu or click the E@@ Q in the player window . once you select the cross @-@ field E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is in no other player . however , you can not deter@@ red from the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be split into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users .
the context browser displays various information regarding the running piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . this three sub@@ window will be added later in detail . they provide information about the current piece on different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might have noticed that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented here are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the Statisti@@ cal window can be collected ( ex@@ tras ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the just ongoing piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information on the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . among them you see the cover image of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this symbol to pursue the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information on the current piece . you see here how often and when the piece has been played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context @-@ browser , the cover images are displayed in the same folder as the actual piece . file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces there are the most favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest @-@ rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set the information displayed in the music window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current performer that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing with play@@ back . you can also click with the right mouse button and then select from the context menu one of the ways to add the piece or record to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded rec@@ text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text from other web pages . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , you try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which to be started .
the button Edi@@ ting allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the collection database is stored . this is not a run text script needed .
the button Find a search on google.com with the song for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group interpre@@ ters - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are not dis@@ regard .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t / album - first the pieces are ordered according to performer and among them will see another division after the respective album . if you want to see Con@@ clu@@ sions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ting after performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by one another . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces are first shown by genre and beneath interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - this setting works just as the above , but additionally still sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to expos@@ ing and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; your collection will automatically detect when you have something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the construction view . references to the use of this fil@@ ters , please refer to the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter a selection box , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . of course , you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection @-@ browser you will receive the following possibilities .
loading - This le@@ ert the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in play@@ back .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save a playlist ... it saves the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name in which the list is to be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add pieces into the queue for transmission to the media player . further details can be found in the section about the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / ups burn - Dad@@ es will be sent the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - opens the dialog for piece of information and lets you change the tags for one or several pieces .
( s ) files in the tr@@ ash@@ can move ... - will open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - marking the chosen album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to be different interpre@@ ters .
compilation mark@@ er raise - changes a compilation of the album back into a normal album . the album will no longer appear under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the associated interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ lists browser is designed to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , he also contains Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists for running time automatically . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even self @-@ created play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used for example to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the top list of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list . if you are finished , click on over@@ load . thus , the pieces will be loaded onto your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , and solve the drives permit for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you can search a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all the files will be hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria .
in the lower part of the browser &apos;s browser , you will find an address bar which allows you to pick music from a depos@@ ited URL . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and input box , you can play music from there into the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attach of files can be tricky by simply f@@ ading . in the case , the susp@@ end of the Shift key can be helpful : thereby getting inserted files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse .
the playlist en@@ list all of you to play@@ through pieces . you can modify the order by entering the entries at the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces will be displayed . to reset the filter , squee@@ ze the filter as long as the text box will be empty again .
if you input through space separate search terms , is called &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after entries that contain all search terms . if you enter e.g. one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , you are searching for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you would like to search for entries that include spaces , then add the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries that Mike Old@@ field does not include , but after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search box , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that are not included .
you can combine this syn@@ combination with one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher assessment as 50 and not included the comment .
you can specify the play@@ sequence of entries by holding the Str@@ g button down , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you can add the button add , with which you can add the playlist pieces . right next to it , you can save playlist , empty and random@@ ly mixing .
next , the buttons will turn back and re @-@ produce . thus , you can und@@ re@@ vert changes to the playlist or restore .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ hes rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration setup .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume management . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up the tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and re @-@ pick can simply change by clicking with the mouse double in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to disable the option status bar , in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alized plug @-@ ins . there you can choose the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting promotions Cover from the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in der &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will first play , 2 as second , and so on .
the administration of the queue open a piece of ex@@ tras and then click on + . you can also add the pieces in the playlist , then click on + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up this follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile that works this dynamic playlist .
double @-@ click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist , so you may save !
the two presented modes of random mix and play@@ lists . fill in immediately your playlist and you can add at least one piece himself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button Neu @-@ fill the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist process opens a dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist is continuously growing , the setting for coming pieces will be over@@ taken , and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces are removed under consideration of the play@@ mate pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist continuously grows , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you are joining several play@@ lists , will add &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow their own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry in the list will be installed . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button for further scripts .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . choose to delete the script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please check in the section writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this quick instruction will show you how to create with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD create an audio CD . to keep track of the steps , you must have an easy installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window in which you can choose which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other losses , then remember that you &apos;ll get to MP3 a lower quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ d@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . wait for the computer to complete the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to trace the steps , you have to have an easy installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; have entered the CD @-@ CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copying a data CD , please select ex@@ tras , CD copy ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings to burning .
after all of you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button Start . you will now see a dialogue which looks like this or something like that :
in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copying process . once reading the original file is completed , you will be asked for an empty CD medium that the data is to be burned down .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the Fig@@ ure file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the Fig@@ ure file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can not find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules not find . to fix this issue , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get the newest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . you can get feedback from the forums and learn news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audi@@ o- or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all the functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and expand these functions . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning of CDs . in some cases achieved &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality at burned audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are commonly referred to as Ripper .
O@@ GG Pre@@ vention : O@@ GG Pre@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Pre@@ vention benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( eg MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
L@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial endo@@ co@@ ders . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source code for loss of loss audio compression and compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder and the external audio @-@ enco@@ ding module , so you can read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to convert them to an audio CD .
so@@ x : a relief program that can go between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped author@@ ship to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video @-@ CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be use@@ able to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create CD &apos;s and MP3 @-@ collections ; without standardization , the different recep@@ tions can lead to different albums to the unpleasant effect that the musical pieces can be reproduced .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and to reproduce all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects recently . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialog store will appear , with which you can choose the folder and file name for the project file .
saves all of the opened projects . that &apos;s the same when you would save for every single project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can break off and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any non @-@ stored project for each project to happen , just as if you were called for any project file .
closes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project will be asked what to happen so as if you could have called the file .
when you call this entry , you can select the relevant dialog files to add to the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the characteristics dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you convert files to the current project . this is useful when you are not used for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files existing in the medium already available files and folders .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function uses &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it ends only the previously imported files back .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows without project file to create a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only want to burn one image from a CD which you can then eventually burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of losing a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue will not be supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
opens the dialog for delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you write the choice between the typ@@ ing modes and incre@@ mental .
if the dialog burns a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file is currently not supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
if a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously exu@@ ded DVD video can be transformed . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all@@ u@@ ously . it contains information about the exu@@ ber@@ ed video , enco@@ ding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the connected media . this information is displayed in the view view and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ sets of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switch the folder view , or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the view view is enabled , its content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features like media info , locks and cur@@ fe@@ ws of the drive or throw of the medium .
turns the table view a or out . the view view enables you to select and pulling files into the project view . the view view is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs unless a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switch the head list in the project view , or out . the p@@ oul@@ der list is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible if the project view has open projects . the p@@ fle@@ eing has no real function , it looks only pretty , and divi@@ des the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialogue window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after one of the available commands on the upper part , you can adjust the button order further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the correct authorization to be adjusted to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system manager rights needs , therefore you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) .
opens the settings from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here general programs can be made . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ dri@@ b . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and sub@@ mitting the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b is , like many other &amp; k@@ ills ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; use functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ all@@ ity , so it &apos;s more essential to what the attached programs you give .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; use functions , you have to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; Start is . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ ens ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface from &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; presents functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void @-@ format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void @-@ format D@@ v@@ d ( ) void @-@ file ( ) void ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void ( ) void ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X Project method one can generate a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ ick@@ turn this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is applicable only to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string parameter , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string Path ) void @-@ mod@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string Path , Q@@ string new@@ Name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
so it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cream Re@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT PH@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ sting / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; G@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ ah ; . with it easy audio CD , read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; G@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( compressed files in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern , which these W@@ AV files ( compressed compression ) does not have to be supported by Linux distribution . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD is read , and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss of F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , the read of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders are already available , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , it is not necessary to install the co@@ coa packages that are needed . if for example F@@ LA@@ C does not need to be used , the installation is not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to co@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to byp@@ ass the protection . in any case , it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even avoid the mechanisms of copying tools . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be made only once ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD is explained . this results ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the interface that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of commands given by the main window . on the page step by step , there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program maps for the configuration of the program .
launches the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a Encoder is configured in the setup settings in the setup mode - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection with a different Encoder can be read as the standard . it is to note that previously the Encoder in the tab map settings in the setup dialog was configured .
opens the file manager , so an already selected file to code is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the layout dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; closed ) .
opens the main introduc@@ tory dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different tab@@ s ( like Encoder , for setup of the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates , and helps you in choosing the right co@@ aster .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compressed depending on their psycho@@ acute model , MP3 and O@@ GG might have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce less important as both codes are very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high level of sound quality ( at high rate rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , slightly higher quality at deeper rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car @-@ stereo systems . today - initially , these devices usually support the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio @-@ quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most of the music &apos;s acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ Pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , Com@@ pres@@ sion rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ Pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , Com@@ pres@@ sion rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music by youths , portable devices and autoimmune systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you want absolutely the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with cooking programs , there is often a combination of programs for the co@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches to these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to add the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded using l@@ ame , the switch @-@ set of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in ass@@ istants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio @-@ CDs , so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself to the computer . it is noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m from the U@@ e@@ ber@@ ator : therefore , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less so the information can be added without the artist to the music company . any information can be obtained by an artist through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively used to use a cross @-@ box ( sending an address ) . in this kind of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for use of free@@ DB , the geograph@@ ically the nearest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mir@@ rors for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which can be used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that this cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precise , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the suitable distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
to save the under@@ ed W@@ AV files , the codi@@ le and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss of compres@@ sing for audio data ) to the setup of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the codi@@ le package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a codi@@ fication , more information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ vent window ( eg . console ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the installation of the device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reader , and whether both cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio codes of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a reference to what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by step , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program just what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , everything set up and our first &amp; CD . we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , whatever you can do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you can &apos;t have writing on it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what has to be repeated for any allowance &amp; CD .
here we determine the using enco@@ ding to the compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the free@@ ware to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not read it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , it can also provide the effective device drawing . if on the drive with other programs can be accessed , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stick and an attempt with the existing entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Kar@@ divi@@ der General Settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be exposed / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only when you select un@@ complete information , so that you will be notified when information is missing for the detection of keywords ( tags ) .
the Car@@ tei@@ card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second choice field is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry is immediately connected if you later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the fil@@ es@@ - or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , further note : if you want to enter everything manually , then disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not be used . however , this is about 6@@ 20 MB in the offline mode , consider the two selection fields selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following tab@@ s .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data inquiry , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . set everything as it is in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load will be distributed among the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server as but as many fire@@ walls have the protocol of 87@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first an@@ cros@@ sover should de@@ activate .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , please cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you have to cross this cross , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files are stored , the field is not yet crossed , the files will not be made in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
everything to enter as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ Pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , it is an adjustment for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously to codi@@ fying W@@ AV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ de more than one W@@ AV file simultaneously .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for any reading of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section will be described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive . we will build MP3 files . first , the folder structure , the way we want to pick up the Internet , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , the process of which is described in this paragraph , must be repeated for any allowance &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully transferred to free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually transfer instead of using it from the internet . comments will point out to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD is now ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window , be en@@ rolled .
after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been picked up successfully from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there &apos;s a window em@@ bell@@ ished , and you can select the database entry that your opinion best suits your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cros@@ sover for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local database , you need the access to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : CD editor - input of CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ver per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from free@@ DB is the CD editor not empty , but it contains already the data as in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags . this option is set up on the box map settings ; let &apos;s take a look at the section &quot; Basic Settings . &quot;
you can change the tag information of the generated files later on with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by any codes or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to find more information .
simply select an entry that is apparent with the style of the trig@@ ger@@ ent CD . in this example , this is not important , as we do not transmit the &amp; CD . for further information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are under rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors will be back and you will see that the fields are filled with the data already recorded with the recorded data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece definitely provide and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list .
note that there &apos;s a check @-@ in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or make sure you select the button All pieces choose at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
got started by clicking on the button selection read the read process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab orders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is being read straight on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the bottom line of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a coding which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folders are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked whether you have write writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 to the format MP3 . thus , reading and code in parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting , to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and code . in high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous reading and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers is . after the last piece is co@@ d@@ ded , a small window will end with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; G@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; nowadays , within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S are already familiar with CV@@ S . however , most distri@@ butions are already included a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; box ; -@@ package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is directed to persons selected by source files , and not for users intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different tab@@ s of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on after the first time starting the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu item ?
what is all about ? who read this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it &apos;s considered as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; however , who also always want to add something useful to change or change it . at least just after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange , if you succeeded to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ isons of &amp; k@@ ah ; besides others , he has with real @-@ time and kar@@ a@@ oke en@@ rol@@ ment of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asonic project driver , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of every MIDI @-@ channel by raising the weigh@@ ted keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id can pull .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( property events or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically det@@ ects the procedure used .
sitting support . if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , KM@@ id will start again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and beg@@ ging the button off in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu piece , or to@@ iling the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window move . ( with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then inter@@ play each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template , and so change the play@@ speed . to restore the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space @-@ button has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button break or the pick of the menu entry in the menu , then inter@@ rup@@ ting the playing button while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playing .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ity type is automatically enabled , so you do not have to manually set up a song . however , in the menu settings the entry Autom@@ atic text choice will be selected automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an E@@ ign@@ ist@@ ype , select from the Settings menu settings the entries text events or rec@@ ap@@ tions . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you are summar@@ ised . this will be played in the series . in this section stands , how you can use collections efficiently .
to put a collection , open first the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the wish in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not saved . keep in mind , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting managers . there you can add a song with the button add a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can choose the desired song .
a second way to add a song depends on the setting of automatic additions to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece when opening ( using file Open or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically added to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and checked . this collection will then continue to be added to the continued pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu , sequence of menus , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in collecting managers , or use the drop @-@ down list through the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow right .
to reverse a song again , select the button previous piece , the entry pre@@ defined piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that synthes@@ izer the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM -@@ compatible are ( incl@@ . awe @-@ and CIS maps , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file containing all required settings for the play@@ back of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section which may appear as often as desired . however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P , &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section explains how the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard . general usage as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal identi@@ fier is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence are available ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that supports this instrument ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) which is similar to a rif@@ le . therefore , carry out the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so , if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun barrels ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant for each tone a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drums , basin , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the tone signifies the pitch of the ever same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how notes are depicted on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the per@@ imeter channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , you simply do this in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is pic@@ tured on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will naturally be able to use the file name for this canal . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored the patch on this canal will try . in this case , then , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ine patch on the per@@ imeter channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o is to be multip@@ lied in what ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events is multip@@ lied with the value n , this will be re@@ funded with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file will not be dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is used because GM will present that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event will get to play with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards higher than to play an oc@@ tave . to get the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you will find in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings
the edge view is a window with a whole host cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on this pi@@ v@@ atures see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a tool , the button does not have more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the edge view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played sounds . in the menu , select Settings under the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the speed , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use it . but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file size needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , De@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without awe @-@ support has been compiled . to eliminate the issue you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; Home Main@@ page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually .
agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable the adjustment to be added to the collection in advance . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow @-@ button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD @-@ keys to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the default pace , you can double @-@ click on the LCD @-@ button .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; working space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI files and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this way , when I want to play a MIDI file , or I &apos;d like to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic enumer@@ ation to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to temporary collection . opening of files
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so let the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me to go on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . in the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es
you really make a giant look forward to me if you send me a postcard from your residence or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , if you want to use a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; fully written in my free time and I would like to craw@@ l any money for it . I want to emphasize that I will only be on programming because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. stages - recovery of the error that the pitch in awe @-@ cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the CIS support , has Pet@@ ter Bie@@ ker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Die@@ fen@@ cing , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a correction or only a supported e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , information look and pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , as the sound quality depends greatly on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM @-@ device or an awe @-@ card .
if you do not have sound@@ card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could hear a sound card , except that of course you cannot listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error messages directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . op@@ tionally there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window , which is only shown when information is to be found in it .
it is possible to store the preferred links below the book@@ marking menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy . if you have an associated entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the play@@ back starts with the added entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . you can only do this by direct editing ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / k@@ m@@ player / , can also be modified by an editor , but also by using the menu item . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist and select either the mode mode , or selected by another category .
all changes are lost if the working mode is left or another group is chosen without using the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ abilities and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ scure option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ n / intro@@ sp@@ lash / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be a supported XML file .
the animation during star@@ ving needs not to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation however , the user therefore can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite pictures : &amp; lt ; body@@ g ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ gest &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit ; / / / home / C@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit ; are in the directory testing / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configure M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ n . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through a manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ abilities , just as the setup of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type ; / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnis@@ hing dialog file assignment of KDE are stated .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles application to boot and search error regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus always a pre @-@ determined back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was determined also ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on can reproduce all the og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner device and the TV channels need to be configured . you can use the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ n is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europa ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
because the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functioning properly . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally by KM@@ players for the sources are used different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , exec@@ uting source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist .
are there hints like me to turn my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is available as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain to ensure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU must be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ t . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last recorded value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for the compile of &amp; k@@ ile ; needs .
l@@ atex ; : a professional writer application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be accessed through the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD is included .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow an easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . however , support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; website should be made .
if you have any questions or for the compile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or become desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ programs . additionally , the possibility to complete , compile , retro@@ edit and error tools for these . in conclusion , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; - reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to experience should be attracted to Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; Kate ; starting .

just like other recording @-@ languages includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page numbers and text gra@@ ves are specified as well as a body with the command \ \ The class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ \ { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a common function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assistant ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibility for the creation of the document . it can also be done some on the document related settings .
documentation : this is hereby reported to the type of document document : articles ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; source code &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Beam@@ er &#93; , Foli@@ en &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or custom .
coding : this is called the string coding . it should use the string enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 code enco@@ ding as standard . in case should UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; . for the involvement they are only shipped in the cross @-@ box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) : the documentation classes by Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users are now not worried anymore . it is a short description of the functions and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors , it &apos;s more likely to see if any mathematical environment is not closed on the screen . however , it &apos;s more likely that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , you will save it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the time @-@ raising time and time .
with the automatic disp@@ at@@ ement of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the same line to the locker room of the command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( saving is the most common and sub@@ dual element ) :
in the view of the document inside the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a single mouse click on the particular changes .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in search engines . as soon as a DV@@ I ; -@@ file &#91; framed file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ly File ) &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ observer for the appropriate line in the l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is besides PDF the incorpor@@ ation type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and environments .
when using the pension search , the elements of the DV@@ I ; -@@ file scre@@ ened with the editor and as soon as shown on an element in the DV@@ I ; -@@ source code is j@@ umped on the exact opposite . once a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is clicked , becomes the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; observer viewer .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project settings .
quick : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically appears ( if no error in the source code appears ) .
file cleaning : in this mode the DV@@ I ; -@@ file on top of n@@ der@@ s@@ â s . it is not a call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; according to the quick structure .
when considering the edit tool@@ bar , the three range of common elements should be developed into the document . the first selection field is for the quick outline of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Equi@@ pped &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box else is a range of items such as tags , joints , notes or links . the options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified name ( selection of a selection ) .
when editing quote , a selective list is displayed with literary supplement . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be found in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last drop box with the name is used for the definition of the fon@@ ts . it can be determined the fon@@ ts for the main text , the joints , etc . , and are the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection options available for the provision of : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determined configuration settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font should not be determined at the beginning , this may also happen in the text .
once the command source code has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to achieve this is the use of the building blocks or the push of the button .
the code text must be stored before the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage run automatically .
check the comp@@ iling of the document should be searched for in the log according to the errors . when using quick installation should be launched . if this is not the case , the log should also be observed .
a environment ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report is created with the font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ .
changes are only taken within the surroundings ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ , { environment } ) .
there are many similarities to the reading and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cou@@ pling , etc . these commands are either loaded with the \ \ \ &apos; s command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ : begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course , until he is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ &apos; ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; { rate } .
after the background to writing the source text with the l@@ atex ; indic@@ ative language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once an assistant was typ@@ ed a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be taken . at this end , a quotation , a few places in the fat and spa pressure and a poem are used to see the differences of these orders .
once the document has been viewed , using Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E to be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) , its window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and spa@@ wn .
DV@@ I ; is a common file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ish ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for reading the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Shift or computer screen .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - then the document can be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly set ) .
the tool@@ bar is designed to convert the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the transformation into being pushed into other formats by using buttons in the tool@@ bar .
to search for the direct jump from the editor to the same position within the DV@@ I ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . it only needs to set up modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools building blocks .
to search for the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and must be clicked on the table . the jump to the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; -@@ observer is made then .
with this function in the DV@@ I ; used with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the respective &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ os@@ net and for the corresponding row . it must set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; when text editor must set up ( settings ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
should you use rapid delivery of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers cannot exist , a bug can be made . if a error occurs , this will appear in the log file or in the news window summar@@ izing .
the log file inv@@ aded the error source in the source code . in the editor you can view the number of forecast La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã © La@@ Te@@ X errors . in the editor you can see the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the log and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the wrong line .
once clicked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears for the selection of the template for the document . the featured options are :
when selecting empty document a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document . further information on this can be included in the section .
frequent users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , need either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file size or a new file can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from a document to create a document .
when creating a new document from a template using the new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is being replaced by entering into document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ The class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the ass@@ istants and the findings of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been made :
when creating a new document the template can then be det@@ ectable instead of the default .
a template can be made from any &amp; l@@ atex ; a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and searched for the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and reading from many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for &amp; Kate ; can be done in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
to learn more &amp; Kate ; and to experience his sensi@@ tivities , the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called for the menu La@@ Te@@ X Re@@ ference . you can find an additional description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ clicking with tw@@ ined Str@@ g button to add the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way when clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when entering the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the text @-@ filled text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow ta@@ sts , you can get parts of the source text in the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and to mention them . for example , the l@@ atex sheets vary from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants can be fitted with fine ski brands . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted this jumping stamp , so that they will automatically receive the jump in the first entry of a sign .
the edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent mut@@ ations , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for the selection . under editing items , the following commands are included in the text selection :

below the word under the current curr@@ ent@@ position . this selection also has an advanced meaning , since this command also has l@@ atex ; commands with a single star ( * ) at the end .
partly down a part of the document can be removed from this first . &amp; Kate ; offers the short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with its own commands , for a faster result . under editing , the following commands are included in the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing content .
it has already been clari@@ fying that environments plays a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for NF further commands to edit an environment , an easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command will j@@ umped into the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to be placed in the area .
this command will j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed just behind the command to the end of the area .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the end of the environment is j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many spar@@ ed ambient commands , you can quickly get lost viewing . this command fell the most recently arranged environment , so that the wast@@ ing ambient structure is not cr@@ acked .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } are determined a few important commands that correspond to the surrounding area .
this command will be j@@ umped into the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the hanging brack@@ et .
with this command , the end of the current group is j@@ umped ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed just behind the hanging brack@@ et .
if the cursor is before or behind the soft brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is j@@ umped ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many disappeared @-@ brack@@ ets @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly get lost . this command fell the most recently agreed group , so that the disappeared structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not cr@@ acked .

even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; l@@ atex ; - or custom environments to support . these can be added under settings box ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users collect the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby classi@@ fy all the em@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) one another . at the wir@@ ing of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; looking for &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab@@ ulator in the next line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the same , for the column position of the current tablet .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers a good source code complete , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still expanded . there are three different modes available for this . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under settings K@@ ile ... ready to complete .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } becomes &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when it comes to the construction , the last letter of the entry is removed and rest@@ ores the remaining list . on the other hand , the list may shr@@ ank by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , descriptions can be found in selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to be considered , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible using the to@@ k@@ est jumping stamp , and that parameters can be found .
below settings box ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists can be made . there are different winding lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; - commands , as well as winding of general language use .
the command mode is for the completion of environments not n@@ ailed . there is always a few characters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call for completion mode is used to have a large list with ambient mode . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
when you call the full @-@ scale Alt + Shift key , the command becomes automatically frozen in the surroundings and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards the environment comple@@ ments completed in the easiest way and by wir@@ ing the input ) will be completed .
after this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; re@@ alizes that it is a list environment , it is even a first \ \ item command to be frozen .
under settings box ; set up ... k@@ ile ; default settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of command mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; - commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; supported custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are instantly replaced by le@@ qu@@ ant strings . as an example of a discount list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L was typ@@ ed and the word trans@@ verse mode is introduced , the code can be used by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X , the code is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
rough winding are not helpful for the automatic exp@@ ir@@ ation . however , it has been noted that many W@@ rit@@ r@@ ter are written in a document more than once . hence offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the expiry for all already written calves .
this mode can set up in the menu setting K@@ ile ... K@@ ile fertili@@ zation . here , the swelling can also be fixed for viewing the expiry date .

the dialog graphics are designed by graphics as simple as possible . to verify the basis of graphics , the sections should be looked after and observed .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for current and new arrangements of pages . the PDF file will be arranged , so the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file .
to be able to watch the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all components tools are group@@ ed in the quantity of creating comp@@ iling , creation , converting and creating view .

many people work in a kind hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features -@@ dialog are configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nickname and serves as unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of te@@ amm@@ it@@ ators who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list , and the button set as pressing . the currently selected member ( your identity ) appears f@@ ett after which you are : text .
nickname and setting their own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information about notes .
beside the overview of their team , there is another advantage by gathering the members of the team : it can be an event to provide information to the team leader when something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific occurs in the project . an example would be the record of the opening and end of the project so that a lot of someone worked , or the sending a message when a file is secured , or a script when a file is added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an E@@ Mail is sent to the addres@@ see in the addres@@ see list selected in the addres@@ see . the addres@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such a ladder is set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
to add comments is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ click menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in an commentary box followed by default text .
notes may be a determining member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nickname of the registered nickname of the team member project should be given to the respective divisions and sub@@ project guidelines , as described in the following examples below .
nickname and roles names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is a development environment for scripts and format@@ ting languages , the D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can set up with settings in Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated to one another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; concerning tags , including car @-@ completion can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / cereb@@ ell@@ ings of tags : large / cereb@@ ell@@ ings of automatically processed tags . normal bulk / cereb@@ ell@@ ings means the tags are inserted as they described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / cereb@@ ell@@ ings of attributes : large / youngest of automatically added attribute . normal Large / cereb@@ ell@@ ings means the attributes are inserted as they described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ;
not optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
starting - and final day automatically update : when turned on , the corresponding closing day is changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into the corresponding coding during the inser@@ tion .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ e@@ types for detection of different types of files . by default , default values can be restored .
standard string enco@@ ding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with file opening @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be covered ) . however , this setting is displayed here by the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is shown here by the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for not stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and the documentation can be shown either in the editing area or in his own view ( or the documentation in a diamond ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings onto the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface come through by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ registration area serves the control of the possibility to turn the ad of warnings carried out by no more questions .
the place around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can specify the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view of the shared mode . regards the different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , will be adjusted for details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action packed by clicking the structural tree with the mouse @-@ ta@@ iled action .
in the field of structural adjustment settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree can be automatically opened . blank knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are those in which the current document has not been found .
the area for determination of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are valid for editing to major text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s , it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ use abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be stated :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not at a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plugin refused to store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store if this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then tests &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; whether the information provided is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it is to be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug was completely re@@ developed . Die@@ Support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , the various implement@@ ations made via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only a plugin is available to provide support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a fitting de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger Plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; user interface :
a view in which the content is displayed by monitoring variables . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
a view in which all brack@@ ets , with sign numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view , in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually displayed in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or they share the plug @-@ in with , to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ging challenges . this promotion is provided by default , which is a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not need to be respected .
the equivalent to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debit request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger edition .
displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current line on line . if this happens when the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if this happens before a debit request started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script , without information on monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution runs further . happens before a debit mandate has been given , the execution starts as soon as a request will be made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction to the script without responding to the functions or lists .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script , whereby if possible , in functions and includes in error .
the de@@ bu@@ gger points to pass the de@@ bu@@ gger , to pass the statement and to move to the next one , as if there were the current not .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the a@@ woke value appears in the variation view .
this dialog can be entered or set a new value of variable .

this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; adapt to your needs and like you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; help better to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are given in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; used to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to give advice and flexibility made from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the can@@ up languages and &amp; CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the day folder and tool@@ ing . tag tool can hand @-@ hand , symbolic @-@ oriented Le@@ aders of Image scarce ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster in a document as a user could ever do .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be manually created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ making . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alogues , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . machine tools allow a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document with no risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is set out in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type above itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when it is used , att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Tag@@ ty@@ p class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Commons Attri@@ but@@ cher and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; nbsp ; text &gt; tag is determined . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it puts the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags you describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc . this is a single element type element .
indicates the source texts used for the attributes in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology name . the arguments used to be handed over to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ tag together group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for one attribute only once . it is a just @-@ element element .
sets the position of a tag within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur inside the specified tags . this item is a single element type .
specify a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly gre@@ ased and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces it . this will cause no leg @-@ break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ os ; -@@ window to start and audi@@ ble Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the review only occurs when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ace ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; pattern . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ coding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; D ; / day &gt; &amp; D ; / day &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor that can be processed via D@@ T@@ D Be@@ work D@@ T@@ D settings . in editing a &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D ; / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click on New action to get the same dialog :
this action is weigh@@ ted short@@ cut . with clicking the button user code can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . it can be typ@@ ed a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on that it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick start @-@ up dialog or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter should be stated . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified arrow allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh , scrip@@ ting / scripts local scripts / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special Vari@@ able that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is being replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; only one instance is running , the text will add to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; used by external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script may take input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; at default settings . in the selection box input can be determined what is to be sent to standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
according to the entry , the output of the introduced application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output . it can be indicated , which should be done with the text written to the default output , by using the value added to the selection box :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in any given case it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and if the day attributes have attributes and you plan to plan their use , activate dialogue &apos; Day edit , if available so that a entering in the event of action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; please select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select editing size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starter button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as useless , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; day in the current document will insert .
after creating the symbol it must be associated with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK .
push the user to the button and continue using other tags , so there are still what , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ologies : functions for tool@@ bar or it should be shared with a better overview of some Tren@@ ner into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and set the dialog on settings tool . make sure that the required tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the Tren@@ ner ( at the left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the Element@@ es , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner support group@@ ing . anyone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its tool@@ bar is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; for normal users the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; Re@@ pository Re@@ pository if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , we treat the second part here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for example @ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ ure Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ ure 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1 html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , look at the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level below top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Manual of content = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ ized .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the cart@@ el depth ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it out .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ ger &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; resources can be replaced .
the content stage is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to display the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context means the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of covers separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; ) these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / doc / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc
if you are sure this is good and it worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ repository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked at the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the total resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email sending menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , tool@@ box with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and used only when our team needs them as correct and usable for publication . thus , the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several key , you may need a look . in the dialog New resource , the input fields will be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK the up@@ loading .
the high load can be up@@ loading from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree will be started .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; but the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files will be necessary in day XML format . there &apos;s the simpler way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and converting a D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialogue will appear :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition header : the string that is in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ dt@@ m
fine : the D@@ TE@@ P according to conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; according to the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , one must first get familiar with these concepts . this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; .
global elements are available to everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; use , available . by tool@@ ing about actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; it enables the Group of administrators to guarantee different tool , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ ing with special actions especially for the files of a certain project . simply said this is the most reduced size . all elements are placed in the folder of the project , making the shared usage of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main segments : the editing window , the construction view , the car@@ rots with info and the tool . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the car@@ rot @-@ button with the right mouse button to get a text menu with the current document et pass@@ able entries , such as close the current , other or all diamond @-@ riders , re@@ charge , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editing area lead to a further context menu on the processed document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the mouse on the mouse cursor , or opening the file when the string ho@@ ver under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers there is the tool@@ ing of the editor . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional als Standard an , for which a set of tool can be demonstrated . in the course of further breakdown of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; the tool will be adapted to the new functions and associated users needs .
the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this straight day . if you want to insert the data for this straight tag , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building insight ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; to navigate , to open and to strip . in the representation with car@@ rots are available for files , project , pattern , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views .
project management is a powerful tool , which provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; providing all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like Add , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media with which then shown the text menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of outsourcing in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script . on the right mouse button , other functions are available , such as the script to start editing or send an email .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element it opens a list of commands relating to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other components . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . it allows for the content of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technique for your development . it can be un@@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be viewed and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , which can be achieved using the usable information : the news window and the problem window .
this car@@ rot displays information about each in the Qu@@ anta current script . thus , for example , the currently used D@@ T@@ D will be displayed on the current document and all changes to D@@ T@@ D .
this car@@ rot shows all errors in the up @-@ up of the current document . &amp; scripts that are executed , giving all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; tool help are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they obtain the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ese@@ en of tool@@ sets is the possibility of defining their own orders as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ace ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; sends the tool@@ bar as a zi@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can give them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; like any other secure and load !
it &apos;s reasonable when you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pr@@ es. files on your system . to get a complete list of options available to the configure script . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and are not executed here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; was optimized for a quick web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him absolutely greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; now long on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ise : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s community is based not only that is all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program com@@ promises they can have to remember ; expand without any other scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a quick web development and has quickly expanded to a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta exec@@ utable ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not based on the oldest entry .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ condition , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts with inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ shots , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of format@@ ting .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; copy , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert from &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
turns into the block@@ selection or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions , to help you .
displays the news window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and switching of problem conditions at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ace ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structural tree .
shows the tool@@ bar from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with one mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries or next , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document .
book@@ mark from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ projects are stored with the file address .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . that allows , for example , to copy video files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded another input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bar and are only in this menu , if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this created just the name . actions need to be set by settings actions ... added . tool@@ ing will be saved via tool@@ ing tool , or you &apos;ll be asked when you want to save the tool .
remove a tool@@ bar from the visual range . it does not delete them from hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; -@@ team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the charging machine tools to access the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
download one &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or somebody else did and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; own description format .
download / refresh the duck from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful if the entities should be removed from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is not present and a writing process in the global KDE folder is not present , fails the store .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently invited tool . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; inser@@ ting using the tool@@ bar , if this day refers to the rules .
in the plug @-@ ins menu the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . click a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated .
sel@@ ects the syn@@ cing mode for the current file . the list of available herr@@ ings schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developer . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application .
immediate conver@@ sions between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the car@@ rot mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is displayed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ace ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting a single one , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
turns the status of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ace ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influences each application using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse &apos;s environment , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ os ; -@@ project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small case letters and without blank spaces with the enlargement web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server @-@ address of the machine , which you want to access , one , except one edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ le ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocols are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ es@@ ystem to the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with the running script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to do differently .
An@@ ge@@ ha@@ kt leave if files , which are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started anew , not an@@ gled .
with this option all files and folders are shown within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project attributes in the sub @-@ window profile or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card is possible ) which can be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mental option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when opening the project . in fact , more about project views can be read .
the de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug can be adjusted with the button Options . in case , the de@@ bug is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles up@@ loading up@@ lift profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile , by displaying an own construction view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edit or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , you can switch event action and add these actions to change or delete these actions if a previously specified event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see the details .
by default , it is opening &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot currently affect .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; closed , the project file will automatically store . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; altered files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project construction gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder can be defined as well , however the entries are opening and open with ... in connection with the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loading files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is remote to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and is forgotten by program@@ ing . this option is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather safe password on the record can not be stored in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your opinion before the flood .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , many high @-@ speed profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . in editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified Dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or IP address will work .
the trans@@ fer@@ ment protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming experience can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. through simple exchange of view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool .
views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool @-@ tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; to its own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ ing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; best to do across the menu tool@@ bar . use and add . the add of tool@@ ing will be treated below in the section Add of tool .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either using the right @-@ click menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , allow other actions to remove tool@@ bar , modify tool@@ bar or execute tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , will additionally remove the entries and execute action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are included in the essential document skel@@ eton , code cut@@ let and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; uses basically just like a commonly used fil@@ es@@ ystem with expan@@ sive organization and interfaces . templates have been introduced in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; in approximately the restrictions you set out for the fil@@ es@@ ystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template , before using exactly .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , so images , and PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the pre @-@ fir@@ ing tree among global templates . further information on the templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special rum@@ ours for the purpose and organise the work in appropriate way to be efficiently . some examples may be found in the pre@@ judicial tree among global templates . see for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area over and over again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to Javascript or Perl &apos;s basis . some examples are found in the pad@@ lock tree among global templates . see for more information on the templates .
as the name says , these templates are designed for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organised in a comp@@ lied tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments .
design a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File as a template and save as a local template .
once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project position ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the pre @-@ fir@@ ing tree under proj@@ ections .
select text in your document and click on File When Refer@@ ences . alternatively , you can save a selection as a local / repository location . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn to c@@ ess@@ ation and deri@@ ves on the construction view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy into one device folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as pulling and deriv@@ ates or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder right and backup site template , but of course it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
proj@@ ections allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert he@@ aders and foot@@ he@@ aders or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , create files or connect with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files set in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and in the context menu features to choose from . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled when El@@ ter@@ ous attributes exp@@ ires .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem folders in the pre @-@ hand view . if a regular folder was so set , it would appear explicitly in this path . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear explicitly with something like text building . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allows you to locate or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ er @-@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to cover a folder of speakers in a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
in addition , you can press the right @-@ click menu ( click on the right button of the mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste of templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ partments ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the menu view . the first mode is replacing the editing window in two parts : source code Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ escence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; furthermore , the source code editor is necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously changes both in the source code Editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ized . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , this mode is already active , puts the active cursor from one window to another , while the position is maintained in the document .
the sync position between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta . you can choose between synchron@@ isation according to a click or automatically . in addition , the selection automatically can be set up for the time . basically , the recommendation applies : a small span@@ ne for fast computer and a wide range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the document features . thus , the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called for as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will be created . this is the reduction of the suspension code . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. tags for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows the change of content , such as keywords on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a @-@ elements . editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ sty@@ list by pressing on the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is as in a text processing , possible by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is odd . the mark@@ er works as usual . text can be inserted through inser@@ tion and by means of re@@ use or removing button .
the inser@@ ting of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ box , such as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags before existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded by text , any other embr@@ acing anchor has to be removed .
some tool@@ sets just like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later working in &amp; V@@ PL ; function , in this release , the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style equipment . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for specific elements is possible and the version of style can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ ah ; still the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ ills .

there are many graphical tools for comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the gathering was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and had simultaneously changed the influ@@ x of many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result had numerous conflicts coinci@@ de .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what was changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the re@@ traction had changed . that result was a small nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , a lot more useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparison windows .
a function made a lot of work was the same and composite of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file @-@ browser .
also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two people will work independently of each other in a piece of co@@ de and make changes . in this editor you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three quantum files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also at the same and perform complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ together :
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of current colour monitors . if you often have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble anymore , if Yemen and the submission will change . )
when a file is equal and the other differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color signifies that both files differ .
if all the files are the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the typ@@ ing work by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
diff@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 Ord@@ in@@ 1 Ord@@ in@@ 1 Ord@@ in@@ 1 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 3 Ord@@ in@@ 1 folder 1 Ord@@ in@@ 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows you to enter the manual @-@ type of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file @-@ browser ( File ... ) or select one last time . you don &apos;t have to specify the third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the same or perform of folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders .
when combined , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify a output file . you can also do this step later on Save .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / perform .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you do not have to select any files , you can easily connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and deriv@@ ates : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to load two appropriate files , it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now , you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you cannot draw anything out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the c@@ ading release of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and deri@@ vation of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ de info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while above the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three swelling are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the colour green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be modified via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the color color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s the next section ( perform together ) .
links next to the text is the column column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some cases where white signs are not so important , it &apos;s useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the column column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the particular source file has no lines . if the sign @-@ change is activated , the line is displayed on the broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the added issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; when you have processed the result . usually it contains the automatic composite already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! up to all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next / un@@ solved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference in the same time has to be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the box column in one of the windows , the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will then be highlighted the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for the current range and on the left hand appears a black beams .
sometimes , by automatic editing , or by manual do not have any further line remaining in the group ; then this text is displayed in the quot@@ a ; this text is only a wild@@ card for the case that you change your mind , and perhaps again select a different source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; the conflict @-@ conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources selected the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating the arrow using the mouse and the mouse , but you can also use the arrows on the left , right , high , down , page on , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . the over@@ clock @-@ column can also be used by other programs as well .
in the ey@@ abe@@ window you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and trans@@ cri@@ bing mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merger columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all not automatically resolved conflicts also after the manual resolve to be considered conflict . therefore , it must be separated from resolved and un@@ solved conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copy into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual cou@@ pling . be careful with this option but carefully over@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
signs are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a line @-@ based sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ er + Zei@@ len@@ vor@@ tex \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the drawing end of the source files not with , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not use with binary files .
the options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved while the next start . ( menu App@@ lic@@ enced - &gt; K@@ diff@@ user ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue will also contain scripts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in short script . if the chosen script does not support this account , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be represented . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically presents an odd colour .
when this option is activated , when pressing the tab@@ s button , the appropriate number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ular character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the submission of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system .
at the same of files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is not ignor@@ ing each line . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also , white signs will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon beam &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a row @-@ bu@@ b &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is activated , you will be treated with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , however , such as a white character . during which , this option has to be de@@ activated . in default , this option is down@@ lighted .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atic @-@ rout@@ ing mode , this option determines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters . this is useful when white signs are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the features elec@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the composite menu . note that the Autom@@ atic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignore ignor@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan of folders and transmis@@ sions . look for details on documentation to the directory comparison and contrac@@ tu@@ tion .
if a file is stored and already a previous version exists , then the original version depends on the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be er@@ ased without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program . you have to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set over the control centre there . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries .
the selection of the codes for coding appears a brief indication of what the local enco@@ ding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a pure informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and assembled with different enco@@ ding .
if you edit a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be working with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the editor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output commands .
disable this in order to sup@@ press her@@ edi@@ ts of changes in white characters in the text or view@@ points . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignore ignor@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded over@@ clock column . by selecting A &amp; B ; C , A &amp; B ; C ; C , A &amp; B ; C ; C is shown beside the normal nor a second over@@ clock column with the required information .
sometimes you would rather like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just add the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window next to each other or over@@ head . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click will work together . a simple click will start collecting and using the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pre @-@ established names for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ comp@@ ose it again , then the name of the last used file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function , e.g. to cut any disturbing parts or to correct the return .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when drawing up this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow the user to gain more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it yourself . the good news is however , that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ editor to convert the entry into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems are using some keywords : \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ de@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command line for line @-@ off . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hand is replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; However , per@@ l needs some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the added &apos; \ &apos; .
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and comp@@ osing . the further operations only change the data , which sees the line @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to work in a folder multiple files . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively compare and combined .
... makes a suggestion for every object ; you can adapt the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate this and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without really perform them ,
... introduces selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparisons and run of individual files very similar . you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not match the together , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will receive a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then were compared .
if the scanning of the folder is closed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ...
each file and any folder which has been found during scan , is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can double @-@ click a folder by clicking on the + / - or using the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions and sub@@ folders with which you can open all folders and folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file will be rest@@ ar@@ ted and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the date type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the date type is different from the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the contrac@@ tion action may not be automatically selected . if that will be run together , you will be informed about problems of this kind once again .
as seen in the above picture , the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries differ .
folders are considered to be the same as its overall content is identical . then , you also have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let back , which is only green , then yellow is and later , if it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it may not run together .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. when a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it may not run together .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to re@@ install both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : assembled and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the composite is copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are assembled and select the option new file instead of merger ( unsafe ) , then appears a error error : files are different , but the date is identical .. if such errors are not eliminated , it may not run the folder .
during the composite a file is de@@ composed after the other one . it status column indicates , if that occurred together successfully , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something emerges , you should make a final review and check if the status is all right .
if in the furnis@@ hing dialog the file @-@ method full @-@ permanent analysis is selected , K@@ de@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved conflicts , not wh@@ iter and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ vable conflicts will only appear if three folder compared or combined . )
you can either merge the selected record ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assemb@@ ling actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can perform this together .
please note : if you have no target folder , then will be used in three @-@ folder mode C as the target , in the two @-@ folder mode , B is chosen as the target and used to sync a B and / or B as destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check out if all entries are displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to pass through the specific entries . check these options to avoid un@@ disturbed surprises :
to perform all entries : choose directory @-@ assembled / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only execute the current record : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist together , a message appears to be pointing to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options average , sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
choose sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without having to change the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual surgery is required ( assembled a single file ) , then a composite window will pop up ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , choose again directories , continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with it .
if a few entries have been combined individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries ( in the current session ) and execute them again later . even if here it has been sw@@ apping or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the composite action , these entries are brought together again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ user up ... ) now has a section called directory gathering with these options :
only files that fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . there are multiple patterns to be entered . separate space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folder must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree ; it can be more than one pattern to be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree ; it can be more than one pattern to be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific with an .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file can be adjusted . ( see below : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a fold attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a moving point . a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in the default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links indicate . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder are treated and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a fin@@ d@@ loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is off in default .
results an exhaustive analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ der , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis , and much slower , if it is applied to files that do not contain any text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ ation date and file size . however , this speed pre@@ diction will cost you a certain degree of security . please use with caution . this option is pic@@ tured in the default .
similar to familiar to the chan@@ gel@@ ist date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered to be identical if when copying the amendment of the amendment . please use with caution . this option is pic@@ tured in the default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the proposals are identical . also the results of the composite of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain because the other file is not also changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal composite folder , not only the composite folder . this option is enabled in the default .
normally , the folder @-@ together view is visible to the composite individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file using double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , in the directory menu , you can also merge an appropriate menu item . if you save the result , the current file is assembled , and the file will not be combined once you run the folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status is lost if you once again read the directory : list menu : new ein@@ read &quot; &quot; &quot;
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed Archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively long or contain .. that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be masculine . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit any per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( please note the option familiar with the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main use of the purpose is currently considered as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first starts the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a box , it takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is irrelevant if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same from two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that together or the same of folders , is not supported in the K@@ Part Mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ is es comp@@ are ) there are already . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 has already pointed out that it can perform together as the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL @-@ programs quite long and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or let him go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and told the configure script probably not the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this is is , but this is the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . however , this important information is simply lost by clicking in the code text and select the button A / B / C . however , this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is much effort to create extra a private file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can re @-@ recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly up ; no sr@@ c line@@ els ; no sr@@ c has been published and the text cannot delete itself . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to distinguish from differences . even more exc@@ itation would be confusing and lacks the purpose . use another editor .
many good ideas and fault @-@ reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of it , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
information how you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with the compens@@ ate . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift + insert the text out of the cli@@ p@@ board at the current rate position and replaced the current mark@@ er .
only differences : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh again . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also leads to identical files in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on selection of the source associated with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the appropriate window at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed while clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default setting , this option is down@@ lighted in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is fairly handy to see the running programs on the working areas , to change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only clicked the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ end . if however , to an application within B &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On the desktop and Be@@ end . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
if this crosses marked is marked , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also other areas of work can be moved .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; the names of the virtual working spaces are displayed .
cross this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . it is fitted together with name , will provide the names with folder pay , &amp; eg ; 1 . work surface .
if this box is crossed , the background of each work surface is also shown as the background in the camp .
if this box is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; box office ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable them to choose from .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple indicates a simple justification with the proportions of the program window . the icon shows the windows with its standard symbol and pixel . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; -@@ main window appears : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other Wind@@ ow@@ man@@ ners appear , how out of P@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ man@@ ners will appear ; wa@@ xing shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row and vertically in a vertical row , which is very well suited for the display later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click the right mouse button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and we will set up the closing switch of switches ... lets the dialogue appear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not have a spelling for the file , you have to apply as a user root , or turn to your system administrator . in this file you need to apply the key moun@@ ts Transpar@@ ency and assign them to a value .
there &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE floor packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen@@ shot . you can enlarge a part of the screen , so as if you read the newspaper a L@@ upe for the folding prin@@ te or the exact viewing of a photo . this application includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you do , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as enlar@@ ging window . the image that is displayed in enlar@@ ging window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting is enlarged and likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; make a select screen display in the magni@@ fier window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
would you like to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse @-@ cursor . please note , the &amp; b ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard k@@ ills ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following manner :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the magni@@ fier window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can set the content of the magni@@ fier and move . this also goes with the arrows .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , push or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection window will stand firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; owns a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy into a file ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the st@@ opp@@ en of the update causes that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
select the updating rates ( Very low , small , low , high , high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; B ; uses automatically your listing sheet to store files , opening a new window , Dru@@ cken , newcom@@ ers ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and cl@@ oning , etc ; .
it may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen@@ shot ; you can enlarge a field of screen , so as if you want to use a screen printing in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped .
to find more detailed user documentation : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor takes a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive straight into inflation ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this , however , requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain using the click of the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also get pain that breaks with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clarify it even though : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; to avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by the damage due to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and carries out a mouse @-@ click , once you break the motion shortly .
if the smart de@@ slide is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a break after the push of the mouse button em@@ ulates . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute the pulling off the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the pulling off the mouse button . the smart de@@ bu@@ ds requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this wei@@ ght@@ time must be pet@@ alled by the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click leads .
if smar@@ ter switched on , the rot@@ ate field is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button , before moving the mouse button again , if there is no reason for the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; supports now the click by mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . if this feature is activated , creates a slow shift because of right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow shift to the left and back takes a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time it will be started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is marked , it is started &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; at any start from &amp; k@@ ens ; currently this function is currently available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please note the relevant documentation to find out how to start the program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values that were submitted to opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button to the user , the settings will be reset to the booth after the last push of users .
the best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first use the preference . in particular , the smart slide you should first turn off . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart slide .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains at no effect : the clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , leads not to un@@ winding reactions . therefore , you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ led , you should clean your mouse . this is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to pick out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . however , it should be quickly clear if you view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the bul@@ let , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt road can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if just a different departure has been started . if in this case you use the smart slide , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to quit through the release of the mouse .
this happens if you are using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; using a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is reset , and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another passage .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you are a short@@ cut reactions . so secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas for the mouse @-@ cursor and menus and the front @-@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent hard@@ ship , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
smart de@@ slide is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert any other action , in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice here :
do not use the smart slide if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; please select text instead as follows : execute the switch button down , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and once again move the mouse button down .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way , if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when in the intelligent disp@@ atch the different period begins . later you can use the smart de@@ slide even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be installed on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and those who are preparing the to@@ ilers of the mouse pain .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button off . in this way can also the pulling and deri@@ ve with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the mu@@ te user to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user may choose from a list of the conversation process , which should be talked again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes screen@@ shot ) enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the layout .
on the second page you select the standard text box . from the text pass@@ able books you can often select text passages , without having to tap into . the text passages can be edited naturally .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ ment . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can retrieve the words of words with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are recorded in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly visible and contains essentially a input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a publisher of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have k@@ mouth , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . every av@@ owed sentence is attached to the publisher &apos;s memory . you can select these propositions which are to be talked again .
with the Settings menu entry k@@ mouth ; setup ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two tab@@ s , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ s@@ cription , as well as the site of K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the cartridge language output , enter the command to call the language generators . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the string enco@@ ding with the text handed down to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the cross area if the text is to be passed on as a default version to the language generator .
if the cros@@ sover is not selected , the text is passed on as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using as a language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is first trying to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language . if that is successful , the further settings will be available on this page . this option is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action following the selection of a text cycle , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text cycle in the menu text pass@@ a@@ book or in the bar for text books .
with the selection of so@@ fter , the chosen text pass is directly spoken and added in addition to the purchasing memory . with the selection of into the input field , the selected text track will first be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box shot of the text enco@@ ders for text enco@@ ders , you can define whether the text pass@@ book with the closing of the mach@@ ining process should be automatically saved .
with the selection of text pass@@ manual data , the book will be saved . if you choose changes , the text password is not saved . select pre @-@ store , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ s@@ cription contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ lds . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box you can currently use the dictionary used to resolve the word .
with the buttons on the right side of the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to edit the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection box language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ ah ; documentation one . the frequency of individual words is easily determined by deduc@@ tions of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wording list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to just add correctly written words to the new dictionary .
with this option you can perform the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and how this weigh@@ ted should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary throughout time .
the main range of the window to edit text pass@@ books is divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are shown as tree @-@ structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text cycle , you can change the text cycle or the associated button short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or select selected text passages and books , you can either reach via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or over a folding menu .
the order of text pass@@ able text@@ books or text@@ passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , this is otherwise used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text box is selected , this is otherwise used , otherwise the selected areas of the publisher .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is not used , otherwise the selected sentences of the publisher .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifting tool@@ bar with buttons for commonly used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow le@@ bar in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifting bar list for text pass@@ text@@ books is indicated by default . the bar is arranged by default above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point .
probably you did not have the command for the voice output correctly or not completely typ@@ ed . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page of General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the cart card . ( see Settings dialog for voice events for further details . )
festival is a language version of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is now supported . the license allows to use the Festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the attitude of the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a Java &amp; Java . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ations . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to transmit without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the language output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wave@@ file so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to transform the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to be the last character of the text , so an additional characters must be added . the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option is to send data as standard input .
the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications for a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . he uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the voice @-@ generator takes place only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to adjust the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ TT@@ SD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page , which is published in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

filters on the drawing suspension offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or incorrect to correct news . it removes the tags br and b from the news , the k@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
Fil@@ ters will be processed text before going to the speech of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unciation to replace incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and spokes@@ person or to circum@@ vent certain def@@ ici@@ encies of languages and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue has the highest priority . it is pulled aside all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received are continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning have the next priority . this step is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
News have the most high @-@ highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome that straight the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; aler@@ ts are also news . read here .
the rest are simple text@@ orders . each order which you have from the Car@@ tei@@ card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are thought for the output longer texts that have no special urgency .
all four order types are shipped in queue , except the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will be stopped and finished .
first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen recur@@ rent . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text presentations as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News applied .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there may be even more types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre @-@ defined strings such as : - ) through text or for a format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to transform &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . within the scope of delivery , some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker @-@ op@@ ters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text by KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a language output . if the filter is fixed , its rules will not apply , it gives the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text message , a message , warning or a &amp; box ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all activated filters , shown on the page below . the processing through the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be de@@ activated from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and you will see the next furniture di@@ alogs below .
for the establishment of strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
type a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you like , he only has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list is being processed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete the current list . download the file from the file to the existing list .
here is a language entered , the filter is only used when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pushed down .
here is a value entered , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ saving programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; number must you we@@ ep . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ ID @-@ Cou@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can be displayed , you are only allowed to enter copies .
the drawing filter filter is applied only then to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter apply when coinci@@ de . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words the drawing filter regul@@ ates regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions about writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs Add or edit as help to meeting these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regulatory and # 160 ; phrases can be found in the parcel .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ forming . it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the relief program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , you can also range x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the spokes@@ person accessible , you can send texts to a specific spokes@@ man , which is set up on the Car@@ tei@@ card spokes@@ man , or to a spokes@@ man with certain properties . you can define for example that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text about the filter gives , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the present@@ er properties that selected the text , and selected the characteristics of the speaker . with the spokes@@ person , you can write the selected speaker .

the spokes@@ person filter is applied only then to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the slide filter if apply . you need to apply at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can lend their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the box ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d above the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; console ; window . start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned languages synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Con@@ former@@ filter is set up , but when using the module for festival , websites may not be read .
due to a mistake in the 1,@@ 95 beta version , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work . however , you must then do that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause error in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole phrases ski@@ pped or only che@@ ek @-@ wel@@ d is spent . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option string is set to the right value for the corresponding language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string qu@@ orum filter . see .

the voice &apos;s synthes@@ izer , which are shared by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the KDE source code , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find it in the folder . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ file under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with every language synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of languages mentioned above may be un@@ complete or outdated . therefore , take a look at the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , by information , which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table architecture for voice types . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; um &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or new ) including the packages and the developer files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source tex@@ te from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ file or have downloaded the tar@@ ball rolling out of the source , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first to check if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script to use the shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program coinci@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is said to be further developed that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual sentences . the user can leave Sat@@ z@@ - or ab@@ dic@@ ated , repeat the output or break off .
if an application provides text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , you can request a female English speaker . if you have a spokes@@ person , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man is selected , you will see in .
if you click on the Car@@ tei@@ card spokes@@ person to add or click on editing a speaker in the list or click Edit , the map card spokes@@ person is displayed as Interactive . as an example , the device &apos;s device is shown for the Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter a festival .
select the string enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to the festival . at votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is automatically made . in general , it will use Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set up volume , intercom speed and sound level of synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice you choose not have chosen these settings .
some voices like multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this starter field , these voices are already loaded in the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( on a larger memory ) the first sentence will synthes@@ ized faster .
if this crosses cannot be selected , you have not yet arranged a speaker ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this crosses marked is shown at the Start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after starting just the symbol T@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
is this cros@@ cros@@ sover marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . this allows you to keep reading or otherwise control it .
here are all orders given in queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the just processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card speaker .
with the buttons in this range , you can fill in the order which is selected in the list below , - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes of settings ( including on the other carrier cards ) and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . click on this icon to show the program window again .
if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Car@@ tei@@ card audio . see also .
here are only text files listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , warnings and messages are not displayed . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have Al@@ sa selected , select the PC@@ M device . see also
place the talk @-@ speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equivalent to half the half and 200@@ nbsp ; % roughly the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program will need to be installed .
click on the application to assume the new settings for the current &amp; desktop system .
the list of al@@ sa equipment includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this tab map , you can set up special actions which will always be executed if the word order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language contracts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue has the highest priority . it is pulled aside all other orders and holds these orders . once the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Screen Reader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version was read , the received orders received are taken back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning have the next priority . this step is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . an alert keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued by the warning of warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who welcome the room straight away .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue ein .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this cart card are only valid for normal text files . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy messages can be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications .
highlight this cross @-@ box to turn the vor@@ tex of &amp; k@@ ens ; however , this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read aler@@ ts .
if this setting is marked , aler@@ ts , in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read beforehand .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button &quot; Add , &quot; a dialog appears where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message which &amp; conversation will be sent when someone mentions in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing different , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired tal@@ ker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker which is shown on the list on the map card holder as the top entry . see this also .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . as the last option , the action takes place to carry , which is specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All aler@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications how follows :
use the button to save the settings for aler@@ ts to a file . use the button to start saved settings from a file . if you want to start out with an empty list , click on Dele@@ te . all entries besides all de@@ x@@ tures will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling the voice , the volume speed , the volume of the voice and sound level . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ices XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or audio situation in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous spoken .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA = = / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis = / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis ? said M@@ är . who slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and satellite @-@ recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds submit text into single phrases . this can only be synthes@@ ized , not the whole word order . thus , you can also stop or jump out the whole word order , even if the language is not directly supported .
here you see the proposition bor@@ ep@@ ed filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is automatically created as a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter . you can change its settings or add further proposition bor@@ ep@@ ed filters , beginners will fall away from it .
the easiest way to learn the speaker selection through out . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . check out the speaker selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . you need of course have more than one spokes@@ person , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the full text block , which can last very long ,
you can hold text files then on the cart tab or break down , even if the language is not supported this function .
for these reasons the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ ing filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ z@@ limit@@ en@@ recogni@@ z@@ filter compare text with a regular expression of pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ular character ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the filter borders , which is automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default filters reserve the string to reserve .
SB@@ D filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ nights ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen repression .
if you have removed from accum@@ ulating the normal Satan @-@ bound@@ ed filter , you can insert this again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included in the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the Car@@ list menu Interphone selection , you can re@@ write the Spe@@ aker settings for application . the car@@ rot card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the Car@@ tei@@ card spokes@@ man ) . in other words , no speakers will be defined .
the use of the most suitable speaker , which shows all the properties of a modular intercom . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom . otherwise , you choose the speaker . otherwise , you choose the speaker . otherwise , the speakers are selected , the most originally built @-@ to @-@ date properties .
select the method for entering the desired Interphone properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
here , select the properties of the desired intercom . if this property does not play a role , do not give you anything .
select this cross @-@ field if the property is to have priority before other properties . you can also place multiple mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor when running the issue is , it is always treated as a prefer@@ ential property . the only case in which you might want to specify the attribute language , is before you know that a particular application is sent text in a different language than that of the working environment .
to use all properties in the field of speaker which is most likely to clear , click on the selection button and then use speaker which corresponds to the speakers listed below .
in this case 0 is 0 for the last word order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number , the input is 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr rus@@ hes immediately when it started . I have pre @-@ compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get any back@@ tracking .
G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , if the problem is not solved , it may be an un@@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ stre@@ amer .
the audio output above Al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I have a word order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur in Al@@ sa , which can prevent an simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . tips for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed her and can use them in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / ect@@ ts@@ d / name the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer .
on the Car@@ tei@@ card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program so@@ x is installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H det@@ ectable . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ s like Festival Interactive provide an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the talk speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read about your own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the transformation of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conver@@ tible filter , and set the talk speed .
I don &apos;t manage that websites are pre @-@ read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at the 1,@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able gender does not seem to work . so that festival does not make any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber uses the gender tags . the same applies to the Voice tags .
I have added a piece of strings filters and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer in a double @-@ screen print or going back . on the car@@ rot orders is shown , the order can only be done out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , frac@@ tory , compres@@ sive sign , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you may not be fil@@ tered . use the filter instead of a filter for satellite detection .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer , whose source code is open in general , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , intercom speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . do you want to read Web sites , you have to install the ( Male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets a record 1.@@ 95 in beta or later . the voice is still in the early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / year / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; please look for the first time on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ese as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer will take over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded from

after installation a new module network settings at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; shown . the module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : the device at all displays and setting the network features .
in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded via adaptation of the following files , accordingly to the kernel release :
the module net@@ settings is loaded when the config settings is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this system will automatically detect the system to detect the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release points best corresponds to . by selecting the setting non @-@ once @-@ ask , the definition can be permanent . at the next start of the network settings , this selection is automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed grey , which means the settings can only be viewed through clicking the button management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the total functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three horse@@ men :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button @-@ button ... in a dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below and shows the dialog with further possibilities .
with selecting Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings will be required for each system start . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information on each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selective list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP according to the system .
with the selection Manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address . in the input field IP address must be specified the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask is set to set the sub@@ network mask .
if this setting is marked , the system is initi@@ alizing the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alisation is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
net@@ work@@ devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch @-@ off of a fully @-@ switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface . ....
net@@ work@@ devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch off of a activated network device is selected by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if there is more than one network interface available on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name replaced by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers request only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing up part of the named nam@@ ing is a simple administration of this list . entries may be added , removed or changed den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a tra@@ ges and add @-@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons , or are re@@ arranged in priority .
by clicking the button of the button , a DNS server can be added to nam@@ ing a DNS server . it will be displayed the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ators to nam@@ ing the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of particular known hosts describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it may replace DNS server .
normally the list contains any known machine some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still available in the test or in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
type the name of the well @-@ known machine and click the button Add . if the well @-@ known computer has multiple ali@@ ases , de button add several times and enter the other alias @-@ names .
select an entry of any known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog of acquain@@ tance calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , you have to switch to a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface , such as k@@ icks or the installation tool of their distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ ens is sufficient , but additionally the development packages are necessary with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file will be discussed .
this section can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network are convey@@ ed .
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . from IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to be consistent in the near future . this description is therefore focusing on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is aware of . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work is the network administrator which addresses a valid IP address , or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen as easily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so your use is possible .
of course , access to the internet can be made for such machines by hiring a gate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , usually addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 uses . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . the first one is the so @-@ called standard route , the 2nd to the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) .
the PS@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections , some other content is to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you see a list already included tasks and associated environmental variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears for all users of the system as well as system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be up and folded .
at a de@@ activation task , program name and parameters cannot be displayed and displayed under description .
the seper@@ ate ambient variables are the otherwise existing environment variables for all specified tasks except effect . in a de@@ activation variable appears as a description disabled .
to create a new task , select the tasks -@@ folder first . proceed then in the menu to edit New .... aging , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks @-@ folder and click in the following context menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rigid program &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you can either indicate a relative or an absolute path . if you want to search the program first , press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
choose the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can supply the minutes in five @-@ distance steps .
if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ Day ( e ) as well as a week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed with a suitable date and a suitable week@@ day . if you run for example the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will run independently of the week@@ day , and also on every Sunday the months , no matter what date they fall .
as when creating new tasks , changes are only then active when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved .

&amp; D : is a backup program for band working on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to quickly , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer it takes when you secur@@ es ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ date ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; D : trains the band back and read the pr@@ elo@@ ad of the banker . realize &amp; k@@ date ; the fore@@ spell on the tape do not , you &apos;ll be asked if the band is format@@ ted .
realize &amp; k@@ date ; the fore@@ spell , looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band &apos;s index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes the belt drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through out of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the gang , first of all must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; D : there &apos;s a change of symbols for the band to realize that incorpor@@ ating the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the volume can now be rejected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ date ; used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ date ; format@@ ted .
a band @-@ types must be format@@ ted before you may be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ date ; this process requires not to happen before you get format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; wedge . it is usually doing a format@@ ting of the prec@@ ursor , DA@@ T drives , on the other hand .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity is running &amp; box ; with the format@@ ting of the gang . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form , the belt is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you hit the backup process , you need to select the moving files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be stored this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only those files are stored in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the same marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select ...
once the backup was introduced , dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , dialogue will be backup . the dialog shows the progress of the security process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
highlight a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the check process has been started , the dialog settings for testing . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for the review .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears over . this dialogue shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data offset and the remaining time .
before you can establish the re @-@ establish , the files that are to be restored , this can be highlighted in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which includes the entry for the belt drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be copied as marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , dialogue will be re@@ inst@@ ated . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as data protection and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ xes file with the band &apos;s content . this process sets all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this makes a backup profile created with the currently marked files and the default settings . you can set up the following settings for a backup profile :
the current operating folder in which the backup should be made . the list of insured files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders , which are listed below backup files , applies that only those files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders , which are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can apply separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then have changed .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file prior to the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be set up :
the complete path to the device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ tention variant of the band &apos;s device .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; box ; before the tape is em@@ powered loading of the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option turned on to block &amp; k@@ date ; to block the throw at the belt drive . maybe this setting does not work with all band@@ drives .
if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ date ; automatically the tape is k@@ icked off . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ners .
is the option turned on to change &amp; box ; the hard@@ working block size for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block@@ ages . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to &amp; b ; in any case the block@@ size for your belt work is shared .
if this file is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the gang . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the file content is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , with the host name of the full name of the system , in which the tape is format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ date / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar leave . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ observer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , users access quickly access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer in the background makes . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 possesses &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot places &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting up &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially , the main protocol of the system - the system protocols - will not appear , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you do not have a small news window . the protocol files are usually found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have a permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a written crit@@ erion . the list of the log @-@ lines is now automatically changed , so that only log @-@ lines are displayed . in default , a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can also select a different entry at this point . select the string of the filter button then only with the entries in the selected column . select the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines sent , which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a consp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol lines of level indication . the color representation of protocol lines can be connected to setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system Protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can get the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to switch new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open up additional sub@@ windows and manage . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. dump , you will find further information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; box ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following as named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts at the high @-@ cycle of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is why it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could attempt to convert a machine to system V In@@ it without having a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the high @-@ level of the system or switching onto another run@@ time . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ tes , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems possess this file , even if there is actually not much use for this . you can also want to create a r@@ c.@@ it in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line in the starting field as the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you have achieved something , then you &apos;ll be repaired by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you are not correct files . instead , each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually launch these scripts in hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one includes a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple type , machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level , which leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ time , the &amp; eg ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , or change the position within a level by changing it somewhere else . this will only happen when it comes out of its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pick up an entry from the range of availability system services .
note : entries will be moved if you simply drag them into a new area . to simply select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of one item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you must edit the sorting entries of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service .
note : at present there is no possibility to re@@ establish entries that have been thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to post@@ p@@ one an entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ time with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
