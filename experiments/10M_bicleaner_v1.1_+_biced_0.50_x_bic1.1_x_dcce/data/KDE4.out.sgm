<seg id="1">The module Web site can be found in & Konqueror; menu items under extras. select the list and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated in place of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, tentions are not able to make important decisions without the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the babelfish-site yourself, where you can insert a translated text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & Conqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & Conqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about using & Conqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual to & Conqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Konqueror; choose settings to set up extensions.... open the menu card tools and choose the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard setup modules from the package box; add-ons. please note that perhaps more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, the & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Konqueror; click extras. then you can view the page, the & conqueror; for crash, or the list of the crash, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module review filter (also called folder filters) can be accessed in the & Konqueror; menu bar under extras filter. with the module you can filter & conqueror; 's up-to-date work directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree-view in & Konqueror; use extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as a default, the display begins with the root nodes of the document, example: the element, all other knots are sub-elements of this root canal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to make the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of a spelled folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map graphically. each object is proportional to its size, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereas the size of an order is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be detected within the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; it is an entry in the Treemap that represents a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the right corner of meaningful color and instruction settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is turned over view color mode, can either be a depth of light detection, or the illustration of a different file name such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can determine if enough space is present at all, or whether the surface is being used by subordinate cells (whereby therefore display errors caused by restrictions on the sign of the tread). furthermore, you can define the relative position of marking in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">When designing algorithms for treadaps should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the item. during the tread in & FSView; this target will not always be respected in order to present the tightening entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As dividing the surface area of an item for the subordinate entries remains the implementation is left up. here it is for the protection and prevention of space loss by means of getting advantageous to divide the areas that are as square. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns, or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum present area for an entry over the menu entry view on area. instead, a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the superior item, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an ordered entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets, designed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras record the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will also be implemented as a disk drive. the camera can also use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used to connect the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& checking; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is also supported the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transferring images of digital cameras to billing and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slowly, this connection has now been deprecated. & checking; supports these cameras and introduces the images to the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support, so that the thumbnails will be read by checking out. if the EXIF support is not present in libgphoto2, you might find precautions possibly nothing or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & checking; is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for checking;, KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it's much simpler, & checking; by writing a small module to complement one function, as the changes in & checking; even perform.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need not even know how many photos you have, then you don't even know & checking;. the approach allows metadata to save both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving, which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know anything you need to maintain in your system is building information structure in contrast to data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos are to save or on a network drive & etc; please note that you will have to change on a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can easily be found in one year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export a folder for images that you print or post on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, working procedures, constant export of images to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% working files have, and you will then not want to reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking is simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to save metadata in the file page. this ensures that exif- and IPTC data are written in the file. if you forget this, then you can load the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what is to change? this includes a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select any photo keywords, caprigs and an evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures that will need the same attribute and then put the value then. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now proceed with keywords, keywords, as you often continue with other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalyzed images from another source of embedded sampling, then it's checked; automatically the tree for you to build the images to the right place. the changed keywords are being completed by the tree; the changed keywords are being pursued by & checking; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata realises itself. this is a very crude representation, as each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar dates can be found for all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to captures or comments, the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want most not to let your photos just be seen, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time of time is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panoramas completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos is the title possibly more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key it is the meaning of the viewer to help Him through the motif you've moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a marking for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & checking; you can save you as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) if you can use it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE also provides you with a spelling check. you need to tell you the story of your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the Web-Galeriesystems. you need to tell the story so for the depledge a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it the earth not a boring planet in front of googleEarth? well, because with images the train runs the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolocalization are already innumerable and are still far-reaching in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also open kml files you can open with goodies Earth. this then shows the photos at the recording location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice of copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information on the setup page of & checking; as information is stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creators and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. after that value, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support commmas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for fibre-line): linked to the author. examples may be the working designation of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: Andeter photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be filled as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for suppliers): use the provider to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a camp photo, the group / agency will be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. anyone who has no protection against abuse. anyone who is embedded in the picture is digital watermarks. for individuals, this is for the majority of your photos only of low interest. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & checking; will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, plate, power supply, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desaster time, temperature, size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that are lost on the street or fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper images or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data collection of the world, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must not buy CDs and DVDs in archives. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe it is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discos and good recording devices and they are in the right way store. so the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable. so it is about to select the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you have just been written. that's why they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. in spite of this massive protection they are needed for formatting, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which seems to perform wonders in CDs and DVDs. however, similar applications are not available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged floppies, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the Formating War against the HD DVD. a dual-Layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six smal the capacity of a dual-Layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that can be said to CDs and DVDs and also applies to Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good reception device on high quality media in a not propriate format. read then the media with a description, date & author labels and then store on a clean, dark dry and pre-protected site store. do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer's boosters include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of harddisks: diserror</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disco hold the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. with lower temperament, SMART cannot determine this error. some of the SMART announced errors announce the immediate immediate expiration. these are in particular readefehler and publishing number. the expected life-time amounts to between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss of loss, due to excessive voltage. of course, you can also get data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses normally can be re-established without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices are not making a lot of account, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processors are different. these can cause severe damage, complete data loss, hardware alternating, breakage, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from inavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against blackheads is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of the energy heat absorbed and cuts the rest. it is usually available in the form of a peckerbar. keep in mind that not every peckerbar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also be careful that it protects the protection against lightening and thus protect the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can use to your computer, you should also be sure that all Peripherals machines, which are connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protective devices that also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you'll need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. this means that you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system will be protected from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a fall of a few seconds may result in the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a non-breaking power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overtension, these devices automatically provide cordless energy, if a power cut off. this gives you the possibility to save your data and re-run the system. if you buy a USV you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern the potential risk, which your machine system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all cable before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer which allows you to store any data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are very expensive compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you must send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore intended only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com set out online storage services that are available on photos. your professional version is more available to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $a year you will have unlimited memory, which should only be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distribution memory. so they are desastersafely.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem sefs and btrfs are at least secure the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your computer. it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection for you in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interactions within the data stream. with normal filesystems this error remains unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you're not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records on lower level and can be scalable. it's open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protections used in the Alpha status and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in job systems. at Notebooks, the percentage of theft is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss based on viruses is less common than the Meists think. it leads to a lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations; and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; long no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, Cancellate, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file is not completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture-settings from the fundamental physical limits. meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise-characteristic for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras will go towards the 10 Megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">One 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so do not get anyone else responsible for data loss. so keep your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or the magnitude of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA-drive. if, then one day, a lightning strike will have you luck when the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster struck locally and destroys a lot. forget airbrush: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desaster prevention is always a non-local store. bring your backups up the stairs to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since last backup. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup occurs next with the exception that it is only downlighted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transcripts copied rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images right after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore it. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, original keep memory, storage, scalability, media, recovered from images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really remember you because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature is unpredictable, you need to consider everything that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to let yourself be compatible with caution. unfortunately, there is no other option than a certain waver. the less variations you have used in the past, the more easily it is the question of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available nowadays for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: everytime you change your machine architecture, your memory and safety technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have been planning the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not attach them.</seg>
<seg id="235">The new record is / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record in MBs; # works with ext2.3, fatal 16, 32 and rearmament & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of an iron if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore no longer use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace the GIF. however, it can save XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG may have relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed shape or container with a loss free compressionment (debrate). a problem is however, that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives format is a licensed and open air format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use metadata. a handful of camerers is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon it also at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is available with extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored the data for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. however, since the metadata can be found separately from the image file. however, you should think about problems in linking between the metatendatei and the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you are using DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata, which supports a large range of applications and modelling, discussions and collective work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your shell archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & checking; then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into WebGallery, code in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print, etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & checking. in the section add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can have photos, which you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & checking, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file arrangement for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of a contract or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays files characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras you will not be available all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, producer, GPS, etc. this information is the same as with the metadata page from the main window of & checking; or the image processing. note that these metadata must not be available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera into one album in & checking; while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are sure to be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the requested with the default methods of & kens. once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download. the selected select is long as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">When your camera is supported it is an option new downloadable. these pictures have not yet been downloaded by & checking; in this case the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in the showcase. if you choose this option, of course, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all download or download, appears a dialogue with which you can select the target album, in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is sorted, as normal folder. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you have chosen the target album, press OK, and & checking; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once, by deleting the button Delete All. if you only want to delete a few, you must first select it and delete the selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; they should therefore check carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete them from the camera, you should do so much faster than cameramen, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually reputed once you load photos of different lifts into the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the image was made to integrate in the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dataloging sub-based shelters. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different calendar format than the standard format, you can e.g. use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% D:% S. turn off the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the stringtime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the config file name, you have the option to change the filenames in small case letters. or in case letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & checking; used for a photo, the camera will be displayed in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& checking; can use all information about the orientation of the camera on the time-point of recording, in order to perform an automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, leaves, and checking out; the photo in its original orientation. if you want the automatic turn off, use the button and select the Automatic spin in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available, it can & checking; all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the page sidebar Meta data you can read which information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case stores, and checking out; the photos are right next to the target album. if you want to change this, you have to switch this option. use the button-based subversion at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computers to their camera is the button download. select the file inappropriate dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kens; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, asks & checking; you where the pictures are to be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position that is indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to use an area through automatic recording of the GPS data to cartographies. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can click with a click to open the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & checking; users want to send the place the photos therefore, or simply document this aspect, it's good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, semites and card referenced. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data of images and GPS and correlate it. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitudinal and latitudinal and other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the presigated coordinates that are created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com with no European road cards. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& checking; tries to give you so much control over your working procedures as possible. to access these settings, you need to select the Settings menu; setup dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can be selected based on embedded preview or image processing. you allow the standard behavior of & checking; however, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardization and copyright data. this data is automatically selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected for downloading from the camera system. also, with a database synchronisation, this data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author is a synonym for twisting footer: this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer. this can be designations like e.g. Andeter photographer, freelance photographer or more independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description for the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publishers will be a synonym for suppliers: use this field to provide the description of the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is a picture photo, such as Reuters or Associated Press;. if the picture is a camp photo, then the group or agency should be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions save the data in the corresponding IPTC rim. thus, the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only entered into the database of & checking; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported, without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images can be stored in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. caution: in pictures that already contain signs, these are already written by the checking; overwritten.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; checking; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats. to specify which file types & checking; display, you can add the file expansions to this list and remove. each file in a & checking; Albumfolders, which has none of these extensions, ignored and ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Curches right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminance of & checking; can then be set on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can hereby receive better vision results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing has used a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this here. you can switch the toolbar when you use the image processing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underminated areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this vision mode can be integrated with F10 and F11 and be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling is meant that the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">By setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value on high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files, you can switch the Deflates -Compressionism for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no influence on the image quality, since the deflate algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the attitude of loss of JPEG-2000 files you can choose loss-free. even if you choose the loss of loss loss and file size far better than in the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & checking, the image processing was just a picture-concerned for photos. currently, it develops quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard increase is that all green pixels are identical. if you use this option to react more sensitive to ultra-violet light than the pixels in odd lines. if you use this option, you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the picture a little soft, however the 2x2 Gitterpattern can be eliminated with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white-off of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whiteboard is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This option is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that undermined images in four steps will get more details in the shrews. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the incapacity of your camera will capture the shlichess. use the setting-in-whites in different Roses. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the shrealism.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & checking; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you reconstruct the option you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value after your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the standard 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the & checking; image processing should be too small, you should proceed as conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process designed to provide a complete image of the particle data, which will have many cameras and which provide a matrix colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farbreconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& checking; and Dcraw put you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. but it creates farctefacte at edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colouring of your lenses, you can set the rotor and blue proofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a color scheme, as you will be carried out during the blanking.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & checking; information such as the color-information of a color-level in the others are to be translated with the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setts here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can store all your profiles. & checking; examines this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squelot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed after opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures coloured not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camerers and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not have any color-tone or gammacorrectly. currently, dcrab Gamma is not required for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof-profile which you emulate how your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print picture, as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated with it. this could you manually correct, instead of leaving for the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not at the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles working together. this answer is of course incompatible:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon extension provides the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface which is supported by a series of & kde; image concerned and image editing; many modules support which were written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, check out a list of available modules. select those you want to use, and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short subcommands to tasks run by modules can be set in the menu below settings shoreline.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper regler jushes the time between the images, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other Ancrossfields turn the metadata a or out, which finishes at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera characteristics show a list of all cameras on the left side. on the right side there is a camera detection working on the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image mode. these are currently serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / sable, specify on which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & checking; you need to connect the camera with your computer, put it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & checking; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera and port manually. after you set your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera in the menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; pictures in the trashboards, you can set the conversation of & checking; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections Delete of a Photo and Delete of a Albums you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used by checking, if you use the option changes to the right side bar without any setbacks. otherwise, you need to apply changes to the button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also stop the ad of welcome screen and checking out; while staring it, this accelerates the start-up process of & checking;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setup starts to search for new photos & checking; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the time time to new or deleted albums / photos. if something has been deleted from the base folder, ask & checking; you know if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different shades can be used in & checking; used to customize the main window to your tastes. these settings can be chosen under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & checking; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& checking; contains a quick picture editing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and to correction and enhancement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button, preview and selecting the item displaying / edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & checking; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data number, enlarging factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the edge and including the toolbar for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing changes your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file Save or the button saving from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the button File Restore, or the button The button Restore reproducing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the image processing can be undreed or recovered. the last action you can undone by selecting editing, or restored, by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for the catchy and Ctrl; -Shift-Z for re-establish.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; via the back-in or re-manufacture button in the toolbar you can press a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you choose one of the menu entries, all actions are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the editing process, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, by using the navigational buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; Mauswheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the default menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarging factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. usually you do not want to use the toolbar. if you do not like this, you can change this in the setup dialog by & checking; you can call this section from the schedule window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the picture in the menu, and get the standard & box; pressure dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can select individual images or whole sets. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exporters. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & checking; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigational camera, even in the editing room. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the marking view, you can input or insert bullocks with unlimited size or insert. note that all special features are allowed. the signments are copied into the EXIFs and IPTC- fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC-data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are selected according to 2000 characters and are special characters. if you want to use the IPTC signpost in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, you can either use the button applicationor simply switch to the next image, the signposts are then stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user-button, there is a button. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also select the metadata to the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Review review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut C + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating will be written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box to the filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously contained in this & checking; session required keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords tree will be dynamically adapted to the search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of keysocket on a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markings of the corresponding arrivals in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, and select a keyword in the keywords, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the whole selection, If you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section of the sample filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures shown in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and viewpoints. if in addition one or more keyboards are used in the right hand, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all provided keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw tags and discard it. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view, to draw you with keyword. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. thereupon, a dialogue that you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which has been selected with Strg + a, and after that, a keyword was drawn from the right keywords on the selection and put aside. a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be displayed under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and discover that it should be a or its, you can easily change it with a double-clicking on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to search for the database in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can choose a search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the cross-box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to checking; s made concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors come from your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or in the web publish them from your digital dark-chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the issue comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the outcomes he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information on color administration. in addition, links with deeper information enable you to make your own informal decisions to make you make the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your educational workflow meets all the criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that has been calibrated on the sRGB Farming m. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image spending are via e-mail or the web, where sRGB of de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So when sRGB works so well and that life is so easy for all, why should one use another color and thus have to worry about colour managers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB compared to the colours we really can see below is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshobic region, and the colors in the RGB Farms, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and then click on info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to show my monitor, if I decided to work only at the sRGB Farming m?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB Farms or not, you need to work your monitor kallibrides since sRGB of it, therefore, you need to operate your monitor on sRGB, then you need either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool sets five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, final, automatic, and contrast to the menu Corrigible Automatic correction automatically try out of your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scale the luminous figures on the whole picture, allowing the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing color shades. this function is often a magnet correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method jushes the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so the histogram of the Intensity range is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in one image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scanning: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright limit tones and jusates the red, green and blue channels on the complete histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a re-ending of all values in-between. this is only visible in shown images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & checking; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white off-out of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is somewhat confined to over a color-bit, with 8-bit per colour. if you can perform too far from the original image, you can perform the white-off mode, which is in the 16-bit mode, so your possibilities are better to correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equivalent salvim of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start using the menu items white-off of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the previewing of the target picture. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white, then it's enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right upstairs, a histogram is displayed that once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels very small Luminescent values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminancy.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also download.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature-pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture-show to use the color temperature of the white-comparison. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white-off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overload indicator increases the colors when more than one color canal is overexposed to the pixel. this will display the combined result in the white text. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as well as charging make exactly this. each attitude of the whiteboard you have set, you can save it in a text file and then recharge it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets puts all the filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral whiteboard. note that also neutral settings will be a different photo than your original results. if you save it, your original picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the coding depth per color canal of the working image. 8-bit encoding is the widely spread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires even more plate, data time and is available onlya for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the handling of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors tonality correctly. this tool sets an integrated way to adjust multiple shades simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistake and you therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for audio files you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"" "the" "" "checking effect" "" "tool has four work-les effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter." ""</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar polarization, even Sabatier, an effect that was created when one gets partially developed pressure from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar generation. with approximately 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally generates a negativity that so does not produce on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar power effect. the original image is the (1) and edit the (2). the applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by giving the colors brilliant and glitating. try it easy to embellish lots of photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the market name for one in light-optimised color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated color with natural photography. Velvia offers very saturated color but also some photographs, especially those who hardly obscure landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight at the contracepts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sliding repeats the strength of the neonite. in large pictures the filter can wipe all the CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counterast and the luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice. also in this case, the tool for brightness is to reduce the saturation instead of raising them. all changes you can perform at the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma is the tool key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog has worked very complicated for this tool, you need only the area of shooting. concrete the three slider below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the Intensity, a histogram, the active canals or the selected range. beneath the graphs are three slider into the inside, and which can be moved to change the intention of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to operate the operation is to postpone the regulator and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, updated by the settings of the picture. on the left-hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scalding: with this selection box, it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. in pictures the large areas of a constant color include the linear histogram of a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the previewing of the original image, in order to form the enclaws of the shade, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit status: the withdrawals allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulator which can be used to evaluate the evaluation interactively as in the input field. the compression of the exit can be used for example to create a detailed picture as the background to see while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the values are automatically set according to the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be stored and later loaded again. the Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three shades, the input code is automatically reactivated for all shadows, funds and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the previewing of the original image of the histograms of red, green-, blue and the luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overload indexing indicator controls all color channels to display overloaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview, and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input code applied to red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha canal, as well as the exit status are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left-hand side, half of the original is displayed and the target picture is displayed. the preview will be refreshed depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you postpone a curve to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones with darker expressions, and that the associated pixel pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change will be a suitable line on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is jushed according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as well as charging: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each bend that you have created may have to be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp short format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to use this method and the three colors of color buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the controls for the red, green-, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload indexing indicator controls all color channels to display overloaded pixels. if in more than one channel overloaded pixels, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview, and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that has been corrected in the luminous canal. shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel conblender of the & checking; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the canalectbox you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first notice how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared with his own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to view the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are at the right bottom: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels. if you can also activate the appropriate color components, as the channel mixer then creates the tool for generating magnificent black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome that comes from color-coloured, which occurs from color canal. if that is the case you can improve your monochroid converting it in which you reduce the color-body first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The store as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each mixer setting allows you to save and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overload indexing indicator controls all color channels to display overloaded pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only appear in the preview, and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was restarted. the Luminancy option is activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, as color pictures can simply be converted to the computer. also, with a set of film profile profiles.</seg>

<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film screaming with an orderly lenses. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film screaming with a red liner filter. this creates dramatic parts-effects and can simulate lunar effects on the day-time. thus, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lenses. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm light and medium tones, while he adds a bit of cold in the cupboard. this is very similar to the process of the pale of a pressure and redevelopment in an epithelium. this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and thus the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">By checking out; tool texture can apply decorative textures to one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color-image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the thrust of an old master, a pop-screen portrait of enlarged points or like a wall-screen on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the semblance of depth and three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief is placed on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">"" "with the" "" "checking;" "" "tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture." ""</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streetting eye. under picture frame can add the module from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you put the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly, the image is surrounded by a thin line, low line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), bottled water with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a knocking effect and decorative fits a ornamentation with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value area for width is 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">This embellished with the frame it will be greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after side-ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into a picture at any location. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it using the mouse. use text output, orientation, color from color and drawing with its features as you need it. the larger the image, the larger must be the character set. at the end, you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. already the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button" "" "OK" "". "once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">By checking out; tool Schablone can apply a stencil on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu picture Schablone uses in the image processing can be used to set scrotons over one image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compressing (9) for reduction of file size. if you just want to add an e-mail in English at the & checking; mailinglist checking-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your template folder with the button basic folder in dialogue. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil folders. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils has been set a construction view, which reflects the folder structure of the Schablonenordner. selecting a folder updated the preview of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you are located three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is enlarged the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Downstairs: this button shrinks the underlying image. if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the picture below the template. take the image and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Ok if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& checking; presents three different tools for acuteness. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for acuteness. it is very fast and easy, but also creates, especially in dark areas, granary pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharpness mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharpened. actually it's not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken out of Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most of digitalized images require a correction of acuteness. this in turn leads to a common colour combined with minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more intolerable sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera is often used in internal clarity. pictures in the raw format against it must always be used throughout the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a sharpenal filter during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by raising a photo with the sharpening box. this allows you to call with the menu entry corporal sharpenalties.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this, however, to deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, you will be able to focus on the menu entry. below Refocus you will find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crackable. the solution that characterize the image a bit soft, is much easier than to use it. use the tool for softmarking with the menu item corrigible and experiment some with settings. the showcase on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help to edit the picture. the display window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the unsharpest mask too strong, noise and impression of grats can produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel can be affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radios. you should therefore sharpened pictures at the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply difference. thus, it can define a minimum difference between the killing of the sharpenes and therefore beauty abnormalities in faces, Celts and Watergrounds are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & checking out; tool refocus is focused on an image by improving the sharpness. it used the filenary filter algorithm used by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture & quot; refocused quot; this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. you can usually start better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular fission works much better than the Gauck's Faltung. the Gauck's Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung will be influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should place 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but then heed to halves.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values nearby 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smokers can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will also consume the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge Gauß'sch. this parameter is most often caused by a previously unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to be annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequally null, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the robbery filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrimony size: this value determines the size of the transformational atrix. an increase in the height size can produce good results, especially if you choose huge values for the circular sharps or the palate's sharpness. however, note that the module will be very slow if you choose huge values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The store as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each of any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and Intensive architectures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but left later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than acutches. this could be caused by unsharp masking a larger area used as acutches.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practical is the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the unsharpest mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color-image has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lenses.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of acentral correction in digital images you can read a technical comparison of English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothtte sets the unsharpness of the area that was darkened to create a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinte allows an adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool imaging body is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm used by the Image team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filtering settings for a jushing you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailkeeping p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a moderate smoothness over the image. weighed value of 0.9 should give details so that no sharpenalties should be intolerable. please note that the detailled posture always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Rifle dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes smoothly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie baskets or CCD Rauschen a high value will produce wavy similar patterns. JPEG artifacts will best be eliminated with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of smoking inside your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it gets smoothes, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetition: is often passed on as often the algorithm. usually here is 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">Winkelp-wide da [5, 90]: Winkeldependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, there should also be small for a long term. thus, you should therefore select this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral single step [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixels. you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixels smoothing and never get bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the range of quality that you get by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the term. we recommend it to permit him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons are saved as well as charging exactly this. each adjustment of images can correct it in a text file and can be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">The error error correct is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture bugs can be corrected with little artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that is used in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefacts in the background that caused by a poor film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & checking was a very powerful tool to reduce the noise. it uses a protected algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool sets out selectable images to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor-smoc from the camera or fashion; -effects of canned images of books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on Sensorrauts of digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a baskets that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you will only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can stay in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the size size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and may devastate the picture. the area indicated by the radius of the area moves over the image and the color in it gets smoothed and hence minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Acuteness: controls the focal point. this value sets the pixelabstain from the filter to determine illuminating changes. if the value is increased, the adaptive filter images can no longer obtain and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for acuteness. this value improves the frequency response of the filth. if it can be too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or smoke-tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak robbery or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminaires of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to raise the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically have robbery, to increase. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controlled the adjusting of phasenjitterreddish. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is reacted on variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother. if he is at his minimum, can remove noise and phasenjitter on the edges. he can remove noise rings and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your lives. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrective with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crackable for your purpose. the solution that characterize the picture is much easier than a picture. use the tool for softly labels with the menu entry, and experiment with the smoothness. the showcase on the right side of dialogue display the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & checking; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photoarteaser.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts of your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauder's smoking, claws, scratches, compressive or retroactively digital images to remove. the smoothing takes place along the images and thereby gets the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the algorithm is developed with another tool, the imaging body. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the Image team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannst and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compressionment or quot; artitequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting aims to correct these issues.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons are saved as well as charging exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restauration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull off. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can also reduce as a photo with equator smoking. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 movie filmed on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granularity on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan facts that were created by the scannerlighting and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & checking; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos that have been included with a CCD camera, eight have been used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw-mode photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression across a built-in oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and" "" "bright Pixelquot; and" "" "bright pixel" "". "there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button dark. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to discover the dark's image directly following to discover new hot or bright pixels through cCD defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the correct image. an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture section and the preview will help you correct the result within the picture. the showcase shows the output of the filters with the current settings. bad pixels are taken up in all of the areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it will determine an average of the neighboring pixel. the color of this color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 from the pixelblock, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubically: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can view the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & checking; Vignettierungslasty is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. to correct corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Forestry lenses, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often illuminate the whole sensation area not evenly. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that achieves the sensor there. telephones may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has cons. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 out at the aperture filter, which means that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. far-angle lenses should use, even with Center filter to use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise unsharpsprings of movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big insing areas of today's film and dye and video scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating an equivalence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrection is applied to one image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three retracts you can control the VignettierungsSurgery and with three further exposing of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light weight damper at the point of the biggest density of the filters. the default density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with a aperture default of 1, or randomly to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma-settings: the editing of a picture with the Vignettierungscorrection is reduced. you need to refine the exposure of the target image using these options, as you only need to increase positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle revocation of the target image, let the values for illuminants / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & checking; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of Vignettierungscorrection to an image. the original image (1) displays the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminance and contraction was also performed with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & checking was a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second counts is dealt with the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or concexe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar circular effect, flap but at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote corners to that of the second count. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second count. with negative values, sound-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values hoverical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth grades. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the "corners parameter" has the opposite character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value indicates the size of the size and thus leads the correction of the first grades by. negative values increase while positive the image is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value increases the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview the distortion corrections. the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or hoverb correction should be performed prior to all assignment or size changes. best to carry out this correction as all the first. if you want to reap a picture and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is available to you. move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the dotted lines. move it to an important place like e.g. the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonn- / verb-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you are correct a verb-shaped distortion, the resulting picture is black corners. you can remove these with the cut-cut tool in the menu transfiguration from the image processing or via zoom Readers to this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tone-shaped correction is made. the next logical step for some motives such as recordings from the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tone-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduced the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window, you can choose the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters set film baskets and film-sensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate the grandeur texture of a highly sensitive movie. ISO regulator changes the quantity of footage and the dominance of paint green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter colors for the reproduce of infrared film mix, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filmetic effect applied to a landscaping photo from New Zealand. the original image is placed under (1) and the processed image below (2). higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the shrews.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & checking was a simple to use tool to reproduce film baskets on your pictures. this is of classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the makers mix large silver baskets of the photo enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="596">The cinematic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want to release a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want to use this specific, gallery-like, street photographic, grained sight specially in your monochromen photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of grains. the default value is, although frequent higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the cinematic effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the used film-sensitivity also corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & checking; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & checking; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top selects the brushes between one and five out. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smooth controls controls the smoothtte or, from the other side view the uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and working with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and Smoosette 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & checking was used; filters coal-drawing used color - and Intensity gradient to generate a carbon bacteria. the lines whose gradient is slowly changing and therefore is not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top rider select the pin size and the lower jusates the contrast (smoothtte).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intention.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & checking; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stolen in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & checking; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtration group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: shares the image in cells and makes it look as if it is seen by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analog to the wavemocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glassblokes.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtration group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of sharpenfe effects. it uses the protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharfe: caught the image along the scentred lines that go from a center. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharfe: caught the image by rotation of the pixels for a focal point. this simulates the sharpness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance unsharpness: caught the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharper: caught the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear motions, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft tones: caught the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Flattering sharpness: caught the image by random shift of pixels and simulated the unsharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharper: find the darbeet in the picture and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your image. this makes it natural your pictures a great appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Trough size allows the size of the tropical size to change. as the drippers are not automatically reduced with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size and density of the drops. fish change the optic effect of the drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & checking; image editing an area free of regentropes. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that is free to stay free. if you start after the filter regentropes, the range will be free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropes Filters. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirror or spin into the right orientation. the tools in this menu can be found in the menu transcriptive rotation or transformations.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture is smaller. the big question is, how can you blow up an image and blush the details? how can you invent the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear interpolation method to pick the pixels. if you want to enlarge a little picture with a better quality, try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & checking; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the Image team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider new size and are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio retained: if this setting is activated, the input of the new size remains the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more it gets smoothes, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons are saved as well as charging are used exactly. each one can enlarge for photo may be stored as a text file, and then be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load downwards. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a commonly guided surgery but also a commonly underestimated tool to compile a picture. image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull off the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photographs will be cut out. thus, you will get a good overview of how your photo will change after the cutting area. you can change the size of the area navigated by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle generate simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are happy with the cut-cut, use the button The Zukschneider button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or file Save under the File File to save the photo cut.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the screening area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Up aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool does not use relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal to whether you use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of dialogue there are two buttons on the selection automatically horizontally or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog section, you can set up the max. relationship with the max. cut the area to the highest possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After side-ratio crop the settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the assignment tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are reflected the image cut and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of contraction assistance allow help to fade, so that you can put your pictures better together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third elregel, harmonic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a divider on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus snail or the leaf sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1.618033988... and you have already been used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times if you put your pictures, buildings and even photographs to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number directs itself from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures. one composition that is usually follows as visual.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides fluids relief lines if you put together a picture. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring your target good results for your photos. compared to the third elregel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's view along the line of the spiral and creates an asymmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the right corner of the golden spiral, also called Golden justification. it should be used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this one can just be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also derived from the above mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden justification. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a tiny tright triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frames, you create an effect of using professional photographs dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that the camera is not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which the things turned to a corner. you can repair this with the instrument; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transduce Free Rotation and jushing the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can put the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right at the top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse-cursor in the picture-show around the two lines. now, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, click the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you turned out a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair is to utilize the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the auto-cutting edge. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit of the rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivical transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview will then automatically be recharged. on the right side of dialogue, you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adaptation of the perspective, the picture becomes a little lubricated. for individual adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you will get inconspicable triangular holes in the corners. a way to hide this is to cut the picture with transformations from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The switching tool is used to postpone part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can launch this module through transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your picture by pressing the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press at preference, the angle on zero is reset. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture are shown on the right of the display.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help will end a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After having done the padding, the picture is caught a bit. for a single switch, this effect is usually negligible, but two shades produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has a beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the image with transformative access from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& checking; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiles were computed. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & checking;</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to choose to use format. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & checking; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression proceedings on digital images. in this way redundant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, smoother results as JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save loss, if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw format, you can read in Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert the Rohformat pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the shell format of & checking; convert. in the configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with & checking;.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & cold program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing and graphically; -dot; graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kp; -program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an application has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Conqueror; (such that a change of graphs in & Kate; graphene recomputed and in & kgraphic viewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs at & Kate; to open or to open the graphs at & kgraph; in a & Kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than this nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; -program which requires the & graphical; -tool & dot; needed for the presentation of graphs. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. in the beginning, when you start & kgraphviewer; without an argument, the toolbar will only open the icon and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first symbol to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the Graph is bigger than the strings. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>

<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for targeted graphs. he produces hierarchical or sworn representations of targeted graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few canoe trips.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & Neato; algorithm is the standard for odd graphs. it produces depictions according to the springray model. thereby the Kamada-Kawai-algorithm used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a jumping-springmodel layout. it uses the Frudenman-Reingold-Heuristics and includes a multi-edge saviers for the treatment of large and carclustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm prescribed the knots circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then run by a shell, and the calculated layout of the graphene to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms special options, or even the graphs with a filter change before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodier module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a basic images. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the Slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures that are to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can launch the module using extras, MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images that you have selected are then enumerated under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should choose the other settings. in case you are planning the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is pre-adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which will specify a picture. the speed of the picture will be specified below. a lower value creates very sudden, a high contrast to a very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background-color can be set next next. in doubt you should have it black. the name and path of the generated file you can set under name of the MPEG output file. keep it as possible as the extension possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your needs, you can go to the production of the movie right now. depending on the speed of your host you can drink coffee or in all the rest of your machine and enjoy the slides when you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along with standard photobox. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible to enhance you or print the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your in RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM, respectively convert.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original county of Him is: await from dcraw that it does not produce the same results as the software from your camerulation. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw-Bildkonverter window appears then in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now refine the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether camera presets can be used for the whiteboard. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later on.</seg>
<seg id="857">A quadruple-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrasting information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss of loss of your image.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to use your pictures often or later on, you should not select the JPEG format since it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata that included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to abort this process again, you can use this break.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time. use this mode so if you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar is not available on how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images into an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of a record. you can set the prefix, the startup and the timestamp of the can be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can shrink or enlarge the picture. you can add four types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal magnitude in a dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): sizes change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Unproportional: not proportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: preparing the image for the photo pressure. the user can set up the print resolution and the size of the photopapiers. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the added images before. further pictures can be taken on the list of the images to be deleted and discard it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you. you can add additional pictures with a file expressive dialog. for the last shown picture a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the pictures list and discard it to add the list of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button to remove images, the selected images are removed from the list of shown images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected are already attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't be careful to send out too many images to once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions to the size of the emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to modify the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and once again used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you must specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the Gmail agent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments to the pictures will be added to the images in a text file, and the mail has been created.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted under loss of loss formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original random data are added to the stated pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not be automatically closed so you can view the status messages, looking for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button shot you can shit this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After launching the module Advanced Diaschau appears a window with questions like your Slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation are enabled very elegant image-passes through OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate Graphikcard, as otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filenames indicate that the filename of the images in the lower right corner during the presentation will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop is that the presentation will be displayed in an end-off loop. you can then break it manually with Escape.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it will not be the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delaying between the pictures the time gap between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect. so you should check this out before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, choose another effect between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can hold the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen you can see the current filenames, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date jushing is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background picture for the worksurface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE worksurface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & cold photo; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, then in any group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories that you have provided information when you have provided your pictures and videos with comments. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, viewing the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumbnails. in the following each is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse to the entry people changes the view of the browser. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose another person you will only see the images on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures to a few more images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can display with thumbnails to view the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can save with & kb album; however, for each person a private appearance, this applies naturally also for places, keywords, and other categories you have defined yourself. see this picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images beside the names, select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You need to define yourself which picture is displayed for each individual person. to do this, you have to see the image editor's window (in more detail) and select the image editor you can see in the picture. here you can choose the enlarging factor according to your needs and thus select which part of the picture is to be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call on the entry window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the place of the image properties. this dialog can be seen on the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the field labeling or description, the captures and descriptions of images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however, are not shown in Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the manual book for & kb album;. if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try out more functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotographs, and check out the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kiel album; and choose in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kb album; for the first time start, or select the menu Help menu entry album. as a result, some example photos are loaded and you can test the functions of & cold photo.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotograph album; as an associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotographs, see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you multiple different time units. each list then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. in the picture you see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be interactively used on the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture will appear in the preview display) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently shown images if you can navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time information, drag. if you choose one area, you will preview images of this period. you can break the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kiel album; introduces you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is available in & kphotographs, integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user hand, integrated version is described, which you can call on the HTML menu HTML... call.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-Pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the cover and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later. on cold photo; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kb album; export file should be created on the overview page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be shown. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. note that all pictures are exported from a party. note that all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this option to hide certain images from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look. most settings are obvious why this is not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can view different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The spectator of your site can change the resolution at any time. so he can search your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, if he would like to see a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and URL to where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to choose all your HTML files a base folder and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored automatically and next time you can choose the location. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if they really choose all of the viewer. if you have created for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise, the web browser will run in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder, you will need to copy them manually. thus, the import function, see, correctly will you need to specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all the subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described settings have been related all three to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you set to the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are on a family-party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotographs, come together, you might want to create a HTML-page for viewing the images. if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to go with & kphotograph album; this work does not yet again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kb album, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import others into your data base. the Bildecooperatives will be imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ if the images are stored in the file, or if in the file you can save all images to the file. however, the advantage is able to pass all images to the file, and this file will be able to pass it independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the file externals... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this becomes an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the images in a two-way. first, the images are not found, so the images are displayed in the .kim file. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the export of images described you can call on the Expore menu... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When using manual, near the .kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatic option to copy Automatically near the .kim file copy & kb album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not compress the files to compress. if you want to do this nevertheless, simply select the option export file compress.</seg>
<seg id="941">The latest option of this site is maximum size limit. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by example, that each image should be up to 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... it will be imported & kiel album; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import is made up of four steps. first, you must choose which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalise the category people of the imported file, while this category is called on your database. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories do they correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can specify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and watch pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to watch pictures from a different picture groups & mdash. if you want to see pictures of your Italy's holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass the different steps from the (1) fixed information about your images, via (2) the transparency and prestige, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptation options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. but it was extended and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kiel album; saves all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file, which you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotographs album: see the folder in which your images are stored and uses it automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotographs, then another folder tree with images, you can launch & kb album; using the -c option -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">About the menu entry settings box, set up to a window, with which you can change the settings from & kphotograph album; in the following section of the user hand, you will find the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">Left you see six different symbols that you can preview and call the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing on the F1-button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it, you describe how you can set different characteristics for each image, e.g. people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On the way you see dialogue being used to already edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in dialogue options you can set complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of a mediator as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setup options available to you for fixing the member groups. with the above listed selection list, you can choose the category you want to configure. in the left window, a list of the current category and in the right contains a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotographs album: shares his module with other graphic applications, such as checking and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called by the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotographs, but are distributed separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotographs. therefore, you should use new modules first with the demo database; demo database you can either call via the command line with the command &gt; kphotograph album / demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & cold photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage, if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotographs album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported in albums: this kind of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & cold photo.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulated & kphotographs album; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the images that show you the picture-look at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Apart from the current album & kphotographs album, the modules also have to pass on a list of albums. here is a photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kiel album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each item gives an album an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, you use the category people, will do & kb album; so do if you have selected individuals to believe and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & cold photo album; not compatible are you able to remove these from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select the area modules, which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example of a picture screen as soon as you & kicks album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you'll see the window looking at the window, with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will not return to this window, but now click on the entry to show you an overview with all the existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotographs album; is the possibility to see any picture taken on the picture, where the picture was recorded, etc. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of images given certain notes at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view of three lists using a textbox by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotographs, as you will always use them again when you enter information on your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the moving pictures within the list: if you are looking for example a family party and on all 50 images, the same 5-10 persons are pictured, so that the names used are moved upwards to find and arrange the people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any notes for each image separately, you would like to edit all selected images and add these images to your notes. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture right at the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all those images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in California, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window of the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the appropriating diver it is possible to add an entry to a existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also take an entry to a category and discard it to make this subcategory of this item. attention, this requires that you sort of your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the locking diver by forming the bar, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by using it outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options..., which offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely out. if you want to display this window later again, use the button options... and here window will be shown. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply looking down the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. simply try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you are using a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture. if you do not have a window opened with a picture, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images from the picture below. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete, or select either the Delete button or select the edit menu. well, the window will appear that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kiel album; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use & cold photo; i.e. images may also use without you saved on the hard disk. in the picture you can see the pictures from the disk. in the picture you can view the images from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, in which the right upper edge is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnail pictures are present, so that the preview of these images can be displayed. however, you can't see these pictures with the image concerned.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you may see this feature that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it again. if you want to avoid trouble as the mess of your images, please buy a bigger hard disk in order to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to pass a little more privacy, you will want to block the pictures that you want to make for others inaccessible and click on update. alternatively, you can also view all the images that may see your little sister, scouring and block the menu All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This makes you set what pictures are to be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to block your laptop with your little sister, simply select the menu item that you have locked out. if you want to see the pictures again, click Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered into the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Remember that this picture protection is not very safe. for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other anyone who can access the index.xml file, password as unencrypted text or delete it. this kind of password protection serves only to those who are with & cold album; not very familiar to repel the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all want to see all your pictures with & kphotographs; manage and spend hours over hours with it, of course, that you want to look at some point. for this reason, has a photo album; for this reason, has a photo album; above a picture _ and video concerned. you can preview this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it is of course showing the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily configure the mouse and put anywhere else. you can also configure the information displayed and whether information is displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. you can see the icon-click below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here to view the browser, see the matching entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">In case you load multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons image high and picture down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as diaschau. & kb album; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image by pressing the strg button and plus or minus. it will be stopped and stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful skill to the beholder of & kb album; it is in the screen mode to switch. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to the screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the spectator you can pull in the image and pull out zooming. with the mouse button you can pull the mouse button down again. with the minus key you can turn rauszooming The Plus button zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not drawn zoomed. with the same key the zooms puts the zooms so that each pixels on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations will function in videos that are in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minux key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screensavers from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it may happen that you will have a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the Cancel and Configuration dialog of the picture open to those names. you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and highlight them as good or bad as you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letters. in view, you will see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so you can see all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in Dre preview view, then you can press characteristics to the images by selecting the letters for the feature, after the picture was selected. you can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you & kb album; on the picture to paint.</seg>

<seg id="1011">In order to view a picture on the painted area. to turn off the painting mode from the context menu; then, please select the painting from the context menu. to finish the Malen, simply press the cross in the toolbar above on the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not completely master but the documentation about & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the lens section and visualize the object in the wire views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously, but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object to the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multi-possible positions, the following set menu ends, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, edit or from the right-click menu, you can never remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click the user to take over these changes. if you typed invalid values, a message with a error message appears. then you can correct the error errors and returns to the application or change the changes associated with abortion.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object using the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a previewing view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview in Featurts view and a small example of the scene is made with the selected texture. if you want to have selected the whole texture, even if you wish only one part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), crisp locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these lines with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through dragging with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a range of visibility. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the superordinate object or as absolute value. objects will only be shown if they are selected or their Visibility level smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as a default. the object tree and the view of the object dividing are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window order, or if you need another order, you can adjust it as you like. you can also save multiple windarrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or below a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views about one another, drag the starter right onto a different view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the carrot-card top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The final possible window order are pig views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from the anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop, or click on the little to the left above-top arrow in the fibre bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To conclude a view, click on the little cross in the fibre bar. to prevent the shot, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you can find entries for any type of views. new views are scissful, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window order... save it. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for renders, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual was written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene, click on the icon renders the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the size and quality of renders. if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a fast preview to full pictures in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar, or select the menu View modes... choose the following dialog box:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets the characteristics of the mode be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can enter the width and height of the reduced image. if you only want to rent a small area of the image, select the crossover section and enter the picture-out section for rendering into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality, you can select the characteristics which & Povray; for rendering uses. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflexive lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user handbook to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is made with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or pattern-effect in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the impact of these errors. generally, see pictures with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, computed and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is always further divided and adaptive because the recurrent loop depends on the calculated colour.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam on pixels. if you set the difference between tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixel is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between color values divided the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which can be followed individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion you can adjust with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the production of smoke for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changing & Povray; the rays for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which is computed diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this tab map, you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the associated rays did not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for display the & Povray. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu entry file import... and select in dialogue window a file.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command-catcher by & Povray;. if any error messages or warnings occur, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object to import objects in the scene, just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renamed. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in self-setting view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for shown object. here, you will find the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is used in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for wire-models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected check points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of points on the raster menu in the context menu of the wire model view. you can adjust here the emaster separately for shifts, scalizations and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values results in a more accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the shown objects, but require more time for renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the details separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the high details loyal to advanced projections, all the wire model views are further divided, when the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections using exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you browse the wall, a wall behind the objects is rounded off. the wall is shown in a chess boards from two single-adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you display soil, a ground below the objects is rounded off. the floor is shown in a chess boards from two single-adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate Kantensmoothes, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering of the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to modify existing window arrangements or create new window systems. in the section window arrangements, you can create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combinationfield standard window displays: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements. a new arrangement can create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can be added to add and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Units anchor the window below the existing window, with carrot map, you will get a single card view along with the previous view and spotting the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just arrived & Povray; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate, simple scene, among beginners, very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program to first use, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you have no camera set, no rules for renders are being applied as a result you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark, and you only receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler: the following set of windows:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu edit. therefore, you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you generate. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera in View checks can change with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button application or input button, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene, for example, you could insert a quader (inserting extension body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a pertinent method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button application or input bar. in the object tree the new name is instantly displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level, although at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the level increases up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can check the entry for the floor if you click on the icon at the bottom of the object. in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object: scalding, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise an unity below the horizon line, just allow you to get acquainted with some of these parameters. select shift and place the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the object tree (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the previewing of pigments shows just a matured black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, you always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the pigment. also, there are many options now, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not preview color on quader and ball, please click on the user's button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you want to renders your picture now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour. you will have to enter two new attributes. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called it. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree each time, and change the colors in the view of the objectivity:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to execute simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball is just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of objectivity, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button to press) so the ball has float over the ground as you have moved the ground round a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results now a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball surface appears as a black black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, select one single color and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some Finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the buttons or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection result in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Rayyyz is a crender method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracer a scene raytracts, the Renderer die hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera, which reflects the scenes) by every pixel and broken, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect as for example fog. thus, the scene is edited pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you view the scene. without a light source you will also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously any scene, which is to be eased, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu, replacing the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last recorded version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you haven't been stored in the scene yet.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the last one command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing options.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can edit or add new dialog with this option for "kpovmodeler; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the machine tool. you can add and remove this option tooltip for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-Map is a way to carry out non-smoking surface without changing any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump-Map as well as for texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Fundamental bodies are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens, or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models will then be processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base, using a picture-file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface from Amarok has many general functions which are mostly also available in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the DCOP-functions from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts. an example call for the DCOP's function could & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde;. in addition, Amarook has some own command-lines options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog so the user ID, why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">BEGIN require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for Ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">Folder / templates will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly realize that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP can exchange your scripts with Amarook and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which each KDE installation should be attached.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow to run outside programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively simple can be invoked. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, strings passed on the default script. for this reason, scripts should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to view the setup dialog. to store and loading the setup data, any script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarosets the workfolder in the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signaled that a new piece is alluded. the script could now & b; using DCOP-functions further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signal a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customary PATHs contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry. submenu and itemTitle are also handed over to use the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script addalena MenuItem (submenu _ Title). to add an entry back to dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook is terminated, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to work for example the storing of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks's script can also install script packages that the user & b; downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2), which allows the user to detect the archive clearly as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extending amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining to-loaded modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok requires just the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have Kdelibs therefore installed (including the programs included in it, for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD predict that your window manager considers the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. therefore, Gnome will work for example. we try to support Amarook on all platforms so we use Kdelibs and Qt because they are providing an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library to days. you can finalize this bug to the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org and also attach the caputte file that has caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and let the collection go again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, this is that Taglib when reading the Meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, just try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is a bit matured.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. in case B. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.x compiled, then this results in editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatic. switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or do not use at least a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common lapse and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because there are many program data as UTF-8 into the meta-infos, but they do not identify as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $argv [0]; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($argv = 0]); print" errors in writing the tags of $argv [0]\ 'unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge projects recently. the associated submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project has already been saved, the file will be overwritten, otherwise it is asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialog store will appear, with which you can choose the folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all of the opened projects. that's the same when you would save for every single project file saving.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and has not been saved, asks & K3b; according to what is to happen. you can then choose between saving and changes. furthermore, you can break off and keep the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all opened projects. & K3b; will ask for any non-stored project for each project to happen, just as if you were called for any project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and finished & K3b;. for each non-stored project will be asked what to happen so as if you could have called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select the relevant dialog files to add to the project. that's the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "burning" for the current project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the characteristics dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described above the What is that? -help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it is useful when you convert files to the current project. this is useful when you are not used for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used, so that you can see the files existing in the medium already available files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function uses & K3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it ends only the previously imported files back.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copying dialog. this also allows without project file to create a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only want to burn one image from a CD which you can then eventually burn later. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialog. this also allows you to create a DVD of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. besides, there is also the possibility of losing a DVD with the help of the copying dialogue will not be supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to the formatting of a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you write the choice between the typing modes and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">If the dialog burns a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file is currently not supported by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, therefore you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">If a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you to a * .iso -file as a source of data, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously exuded DVD video can be transformed. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be used alluously. it contains information about the exubered video, encoding settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the connected media. this information is displayed in the view view and include characteristics of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolsets of & K3b; if an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switch the folder view, or out. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the view view is enabled, its content is displayed in the table view. CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features like media info, locks and curfews of the drive or throw of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Turns the table view a or out. the view view enables you to select and pulling files into the project view. the view view is also the interface to read audio- or video CDs unless a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switch the head list in the project view, or out. the poulder list is a narrower area, which is only visible if the project view has open projects. the pfleeing has no real function, it looks only pretty, and divides the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialogue window to change the keyboard orders for & K3b;. after one of the available commands on the upper part, you can adjust the button order further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistant. thus, the correct authorization to be adjusted to burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system manager rights needs, therefore you must enter the password for the system manager (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings from & K3b; here general programs can be made. almost all the functions of & K3b; should work on Andrib. this dialog is intended for personalize and submitting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b is, like many other & kills; applications also, with a & DCOP; interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; use functions, you can use either the command line dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionallity, so it's more essential to what the attached programs you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; use functions, you have to make sure that & K3b; Start is. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kens; -program in common, supports & K3b; mostly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-Interface from & K3b; presents functions like copyCD, format DVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPf createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef. () DCOPRef. () DCOPRef. () DCOPRef. () void format Dvd () void format Dvd () void-format Dvd () void-format Dvd () void-file () void () void burndvd image (KURL url) void () void (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXX Project method one can generate a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (K3b, K3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject Thickturn this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is applicable only to data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring parameter, Qstring Parent) void removeItem (Qstring Path) void-modItem (Qstring Path, Qstring newName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT Cream Recop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT PHUrl / home / trusting / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& Gaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -read for & kah;. with it easy audio CD, read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& Gaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compressed files in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many Kodierern, which these WAV files (compressed compression) does not have to be supported by Linux distribution. further encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD is read, and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per titles) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as the loss of FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the read of the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia; almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvoruntil (for OGG) or other coders are already available, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, it is not necessary to install the cocoa packages that are needed. if for example FLAC does not need to be used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which Kodierer- / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coerer, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass the protection. in any case, it is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even avoid the mechanisms of copying tools. simply avoid the purchase of copier audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be made only once (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), the daily use to read a & CD is explained. this results (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the interface that you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the freeDB from the internet or can work completely without network, whereby everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands given by the main window. on the page step by step, there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection with a different Encoder can be read as the standard. it is to note that previously the Encoder in the tab map settings in the setup dialog was configured.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so an already selected file to code is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the layout dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; closed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main introductory dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different tabs (like Encoder, for setup of the Encoders). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates, and helps you in choosing the right coaster.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the downsides are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compressed depending on their psychoacute model, MP3 and OGG might have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences will produce less important as both codes are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high level of sound quality (at high rate rates), but compared to OGG, slightly higher quality at deeper rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a machine-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car-stereo systems. today - initially, these devices usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio-quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most of the music's acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--Preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, Compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--Preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, Compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by youths, portable devices and autoimmune systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want absolutely the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB via the internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file name as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with cooking programs, there is often a combination of programs for the coerer and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to add the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded using lame, the switch-set of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio-CDs, so that all the other information can be downloaded from yourself to the computer. it is noted that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm from the Ueberator: therefore, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less worthless so the information can be added without the artist to the music company. any information can be obtained by an artist through a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively used to use a cross-box (sending an address). in this kind of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used for use of freeDB, the geographically the nearest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org supplies a current list of mirrors for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which can be used to save pieces from the & CD; save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precise, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the suitable distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the undered WAV files, the codile and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of compressing for audio data) to the setup of the Kodierers. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codile package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codification, more information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolvent window (eg. console; console). it must be replaced by the name of the Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the installation of the device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reader, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codes of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a reference to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by step, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program just what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, everything set up and our first & CD. we will lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile the source files, whatever you can do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you can't have writing on it (eg; by trying to copy with the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what has to be repeated for any allowance & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the using encoding to the compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used to use the freeware to use the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not read it with any reading of a & CD; change if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, it can also provide the effective device drawing. if on the drive with other programs can be accessed, a look at the file / etc / fstick and an attempt with the existing entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The Kardivider General Settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be exposed / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only when you select uncomplete information, so that you will be notified when information is missing for the detection of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Carteicard CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second choice field is easier, will be a & CD; entry is immediately connected if you later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the files- or filename is changed with conqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, further note: if you want to enter everything manually, then disable the selection fields and freeDB will not be used. however, this is about 620 MB in the offline mode, consider the two selection fields selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following tabs.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server on the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. set everything as it is in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the site of freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load will be distributed among the machines. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server as but as many firewalls have the protocol of 8780 standard, there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first ancrossover should deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time only an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author does not know it, therefore simply try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, please cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you have to cross this cross, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored, the field is not yet crossed, the files will not be made in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something must be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--Preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, it is an adjustment for very good audio-quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for limiting the generation of tags at version V1 / V1.1.ID3v2 'tags can also be deleted. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to codifying WAV files: at a Dualcore or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as default for any reading of a & CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section will be described how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive. we will build MP3 files. first, the folder structure, the way we want to pick up the Internet, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described, the process of which is described in this paragraph, must be repeated for any allowance & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freeDB, see the screen photos a little different from the data for a & CD; with successfully transferred to freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually transfer instead of using it from the internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD is now; in the drive, which was defined in the main window, be enrolled.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been picked up successfully from the freeDB, all titles of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there's a window embellished, and you can select the database entry that your opinion best suits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the crossover for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first knob in the toolbar. if you do not have local database, you need the access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD editor - input of CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screenshot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered into the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidiver per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from freeDB is the CD editor not empty, but it contains already the data as in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2-tags. this option is set up on the box map settings; let's take a look at the section "Basic Settings."</seg>

<seg id="1597">Note that there's a check-in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or make sure you select the button All pieces choose at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Got started by clicking on the button selection read the read process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>

<seg id="1613">What is all about? who read this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it's considered as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; however, who also always want to add something useful to change or change it. at least just after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaisons of & kah; besides others, he has with real-time and karaoke enrolment of texts also some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI player do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; ultrasonic project driver, which is needed for CIS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & conqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and begging the button off in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu piece, or toiling the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts when you move it to the & kmid; window move. (with several pieces you will be added to a collection and then interplay each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template, and so change the playspeed. to restore the original speed, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space-button has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button break or the pick of the menu entry in the menu, then interrupting the playing button while no piece is played, starts & kmid; the playing.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces do not have text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be presented and even better: the Eignity type is automatically enabled, so you do not have to manually set up a song. however, in the menu settings the entry Automatic text choice will be selected automatically. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an Eignistype, select from the Settings menu settings the entries text events or recaptions. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you are summarised. this will be played in the series. in this section stands, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, open first the collection manager. this can be found in the menu collection under the Point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will include the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the wish in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not saved. keep in mind, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting managers. there you can add a song with the button add a song. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second way to add a song depends on the setting of automatic additions to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece when opening (using file Open or drag & drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically added to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and checked. this collection will then continue to be added to the continued pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you have to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row from the submenu, sequence of menus, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting managers, or use the drop-down list through the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song again, select the button previous piece, the entry predefined piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI-MIDI events are translated into events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need a MIDI map because all Soundcards GM -compatible are (incl. awe-and CIS maps, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file containing all required settings for the playback of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section which may appear as often as desired. however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP, "END Define KEYMAP" A further keymap "... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section explains how the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard. general usage as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal identifier is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence are available (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also have no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all notes that supports this instrument (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60) which is similar to a rifle. therefore, carry out the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun barrels), it takes a patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant for each tone a different percussionist instrument (drums, basin, maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the tone signifies the pitch of the ever same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how notes are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the perimeter channel. take a look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to swap the first and second channel, you simply do this in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is pictured on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will naturally be able to use the file name for this canal. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored the patch on this canal will try. in this case, then, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch can be useful for example to always use the perkine patch on the perimeter channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchbenderratio is to be multiplied in what ratio Pitch-Bender events is multiplied with the value n, this will be refunded with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file will not be decimal (decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM will present that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender Event will get to play with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, try some keyboards higher than to play an octave. to get the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you will find in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The edge view is a window with a whole host claviatures (one for every MIDI channel). on this pivatures see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the edge view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose a tool, the button does not have more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The edge view has (until now) two different views to view the played sounds. in the menu, select Settings under the point of canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the speed, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians playing the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anybody, & kmid; to use it. but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file size needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without awe-support has been compiled. to eliminate the issue you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 'Home Mainpage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed to support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable the adjustment to be added to the collection in advance. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow-button on the left of the Tempo- LCD-keys to slow down the playback. to restore the default pace, you can double-click on the LCD-button.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; working space a & conqueror; window with my MIDI files and & kmid; in this way, when I want to play a MIDI file, or I'd like to play a file, simply switch to the & conqueror window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic enumeration to the collection, and the new one; file is added to temporary collection. opening of files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so let the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me to go on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. in the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arraver.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a giant look forward to me if you send me a postcard from your residence or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, if you want to use a MIDI file, but you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends greatly on your soundcard. it is not the same whether you use a FM-device or an awe-card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have soundcard, you have to compile & kmid; using the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you could hear a sound card, except that of course you cannot listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made from so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window, which is only shown when information is to be found in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to store the preferred links below the bookmarking menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy. if you have an associated entry, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and the playback starts with the added entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updated piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. you can only do this by direct editing; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / kmplayer /, can also be modified by an editor, but also by using the menu item. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist and select either the mode mode, or selected by another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the working mode is left or another group is chosen without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayabilities and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obscure option on '1'. if the option is not present it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmn / introsplash / exit.xml. the format has to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starving needs not to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be disturbing at the end-animation however, the user therefore can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation may be the display of a favorite pictures: & lt; bodyg; & lt; IMG Dur = "ingest" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet,"; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit; / / / home / Coos / mum.gif" fit; are in the directory testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to configure Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the Mplayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debug is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmn. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; everything must be configured through a manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayabilities, just as the setup of the backend by mimetype. here is an example of a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be inserted the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as service provider for the Mime type; / x-Shockwave-flash in the furnishing dialog file assignment of KDE are stated.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is in a consoles application to boot and search error regarding the loading of the browser module library. if no error occur, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a pre-determined backend for a particular Mime type is taken (of course only if this was determined also), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon can reproduce all the ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the scanner device and the TV channels need to be configured. you can use the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (video data recorder) settings in kmn is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europa), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support from kmplayer only can use XVideo (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is why the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functioning properly. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by KMplayers for the sources are used different names. at the time of the emergence of these documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, executing source, source source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they begin with the playback of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1760">With the automatic dispatement of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & kile; automatically a blank line (for entering the text) and the same line to the locker room of the command (e.g.\\, {command}). set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following items (saving is the most common and subdual element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document inside the structure, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a single mouse click on the particular changes.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in search engines. as soon as a DVI; -file [framed file (engl. D e V ice I nly File)], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -observer for the appropriate line in the latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is besides PDF the incorporation type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and environments.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the pension search, the elements of the DVI; -file screened with the editor and as soon as shown on an element in the DVI; -source code is jumped on the exact opposite. once a section in & latex; source code is clicked, becomes the corresponding position in the DVI; observer viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be adjusted to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result automatically appears (if no error in the source code appears).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File cleaning: in this mode the DVI; -file on top of ndersâ s. it is not a call from & Okular; according to the quick structure.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When considering the edit toolbar, the three range of common elements should be developed into the document. the first selection field is for the quick outline of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... Equipped & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box else is a range of items such as tags, joints, notes or links. the options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified name (selection of a selection).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When editing quote, a selective list is displayed with literary supplement. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can be found in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop box with the name is used for the definition of the fonts. it can be determined the fonts for the main text, the joints, etc., and are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two selection options available for the provision of: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determined configuration settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the settings [12pt] sets the font. if the font should not be determined at the beginning, this may also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the command source code has been typed, the & latex; source code has to be compiled. the easiest way to achieve this is the use of the building blocks or the push of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code text must be stored before the compile. & kile; for the storage run automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Check the compiling of the document should be searched for in the log according to the errors. when using quick installation should be launched. if this is not the case, the log should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English environment) is a text that is different from the rest of the document. for example, a report is created with the font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only taken within the surroundings (from\\ begin {environment} to\\, {environment}).</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many similarities to the reading and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, coupling, etc. these commands are either loaded with the\\\ 's command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\: begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course, until he is closed with a\\ '{emph} or any other environment. a single word in a proposition can be illustrated with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ 'ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\' {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text with the latex; indicative language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once an assistant was typed a bit of text, a few adjustments for the better legibility of the document should be taken. at this end, a quotation, a few places in the fat and spa pressure and a poem are used to see the differences of these orders.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, using Editor-View or Strg E to be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer), its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and spawn.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a common file format (engl. D e V ice I nish). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for reading the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi edition such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Shift or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed by file (in the viewer) (if the printer is properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar is designed to convert the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the transformation into being pushed into other formats by using buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">To search for the direct jump from the editor to the same position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. it only needs to set up modern under settings Kile... tools building blocks.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the pre-search search, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and must be clicked on the table. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; -observer is made then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in the DVI; used with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the respective & latex; -document of & kile; geosnet and for the corresponding row. it must set & kile; in & Okular; when text editor must set up (settings eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should you use rapid delivery of the & DVI; viewers cannot exist, a bug can be made. if a error occurs, this will appear in the log file or in the news window summarizing.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file invaded the error source in the source code. in the editor you can view the number of forecast LaTeX errors and NÃ © LaTeX errors. in the editor you can see the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the log and & kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears for the selection of the template for the document. the featured options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty document a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document. further information on this can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates can be stored in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, need either an existing & tex; - / latex; file size or a new file can be created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection from a document to create a document.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using the new file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or string coding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is being replaced by entering into document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ The class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$]</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and the findings of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been made:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document the template can then be detectable instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be made from any & latex; a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and searched for the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and reading from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many adjustments for & Kate; can be done in the MenÃ ¼ Tools directly from & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more & Kate; and to experience his sensitivities, the manual should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can be found there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called for the menu LaTeX Reference. you can find an additional description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-clicking with twined Strg button to add the & tex; this means that in this way when clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When entering the text with penetrated linker, the text-filled text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow tasts, you can get parts of the source text in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most different types of source texts and to mention them. for example, the latex sheets vary from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can be fitted with fine ski brands. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. this is also highlighted this jumping stamp, so that they will automatically receive the jump in the first entry of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent mutations, have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; special commands for the selection. under editing items, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Handles a complete paragraph from (group of lines that included on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph includes tables, latex; commands and all other lines of source texts. the only bending thing in & kile; is that the absorption is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Below the word under the current currentposition. this selection also has an advanced meaning, since this command also has latex; commands with a single star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">Partly down a part of the document can be removed from this first. & Kate; offers the shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with its own commands, for a faster result. under editing, the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of editing content.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarifying that environments plays a central role in & latex; therefore, offers & kile; for NF further commands to edit an environment, an easy work with & latex;.</seg>

<seg id="1823">This command will jumped to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed just behind the command to the end of the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, the end of the environment is jumped (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many spared ambient commands, you can quickly get lost viewing. this command fell the most recently arranged environment, so that the wasting ambient structure is not cracked.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by parentheses {...} are determined a few important commands that correspond to the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will be jumped into the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the hanging bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the end of the current group is jumped (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed just behind the hanging bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the soft bracket of a & tex; group # is, the other end of the group is jumped (or vice versa).</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code complete, this in & kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) still expanded. there are three different modes available for this. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under settings Kile... ready to complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} becomes & kile; automatically the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When it comes to the construction, the last letter of the entry is removed and restores the remaining list. on the other hand, the list may shrank by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameter. alternatively, descriptions can be found in selecting a command. alternatively, a jump to be considered, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible using the tokest jumping stamp, and that parameters can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Below settings box; set up... kile; complete settings to these lists can be made. there are different winding lists for & tex; - and & latex; - commands, as well as winding of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the completion of environments not nailed. there is always a few characters with\\ begin to be entered and the call for completion mode is used to have a large list with ambient mode. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the completion of the environments.</seg>

<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debit request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Displays the debugger to begin with the execution of the script and to send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current line on line. if this happens when the script is stopped, the execution will be continued. if this happens before a debit request started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, to begin with the execution of the script, without information on monitoring variables and the current line number. if this happens, the execution runs further. happens before a debit mandate has been given, the execution starts as soon as a request will be made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next instruction to the script without responding to the functions or lists.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next directive in the script, whereby if possible, in functions and includes in error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">The debugger points to pass the debugger, to pass the statement and to move to the next one, as if there were the current not.</seg>

<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the day attributes have attributes and you plan to plan their use, activate dialogue 'Day edit, if available so that a entering in the event of action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; please select from the & KMenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starter button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as useless, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; day in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be associated with the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantappartments;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Push the user to the button and continue using other tags, so there are still what, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantapologies: functions for toolbar or it should be shared with a better overview of some Trenner into several groups. open the toolbar and set the dialog on settings tool. make sure that the required toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the Trenner (at the left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the Elementes, which is to be added to the toolbar, push the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner support grouping. anyone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & conqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar is loaded (s) when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the worth mentioning of & quantappartments; for normal users the ability to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantappartments; Repository Repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part is left to you, we treat the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example @ p42 / # Secure Section 1 = Section1.html = Secure 1 = Section1.html = Sec2.3.html = Sec2.html tag1 = tag1 html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, look at the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level below top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Manual of content = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synchronized .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the cartel depth (except the reason) mdash, but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequential at the top of the Baumanger & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantappartments; resources can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content stage is the area of the docrc file, which is to display the context-sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; script for context means the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of covers separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;) these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply save to $HOME / .kde / doc / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure this is good and it worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used to the & quantappartments; -repository for the use by the & quantappartments; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked at the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantappartments; are you not alone. it is possible to share the total resources (DTEP packages, tooling with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, toolbox with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantappartments; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and used only when our team needs them as correct and usable for publication. thus, the origin of resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several key, you may need a look. in the dialog New resource, the input fields will be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and start clicking OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high load can be uploading from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantappartments; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature. if the integrity is given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not created by & quantappartments; but the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files will be necessary in day XML format. there's the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and converting a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. afterwards, the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition header: the string that is in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / WTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtm</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine: the DTEP according to conversion: when activated, brings & quantappartments; according to the transformation the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantappartments, there are some key concepts. to understand this and get full benefit from & quantappartments, one must first get familiar with these concepts. this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantappartments; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantappartments, the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantappartments;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to everyone, the & quantappartments; use, available. by tooling about actions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantappartments; it enables the Group of administrators to guarantee different tool, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to tooling with special actions especially for the files of a certain project. simply said this is the most reduced size. all elements are placed in the folder of the project, making the shared usage of special tools and patterns of all staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantappartments; -MDI; consists of some main segments: the editing window, the construction view, the carrots with info and the tool. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the carrot-button with the right mouse button to get a text menu with the current document et passable entries, such as close the current, other or all diamond-riders, recharge, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editing area lead to a further context menu on the processed document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the mouse on the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string hover under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensters there is the tooling of the editor. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional als Standard an, for which a set of tool can be demonstrated. in the course of further breakdown of & quantappartments; the tool will be adapted to the new functions and associated users needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tooling is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, for example & lt; then click on the icon that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this straight day. if you want to insert the data for this straight tag, you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building insight (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information & quantappartments; to navigate, to open and to strip. in the representation with carrots are available for files, project, pattern, scripts, attributes, and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, which provides & quantappartments; providing all files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like Add, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media with which then shown the text menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantappartments; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of outsourcing in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script. on the right mouse button, other functions are available, such as the script to start editing or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element it opens a list of commands relating to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other components. with it, some can change attributes and namespace. it allows for the content of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technique for your development. it can be unpacked documentation for & quantappartments; from the quantappartments; 'documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be viewed and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantappartments; two tabs at the bottom of the window, which can be achieved using the usable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carrot displays information about each in the Quanta current script. thus, for example, the currently used DTD will be displayed on the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carrot shows all errors in the up-up of the current document. & scripts that are executed, giving all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantappartments; tool help are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they obtain the corresponding command. the Chocoleseen of toolsets is the possibility of defining their own orders as symbols in & quantapace; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantappartments; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantappartments; sends the toolbar as a ziar-archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can give them in & quantappartments; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable when you want to adapt the place of & quantappres. files on your system. to get a complete list of options available to the configure script. / configure --help one. the options are easy to understand and are not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantappartments, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantappartments; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantappartments; was optimized for a quick web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort, the best & HTML; editor to create, the developers began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantappartments; an independent, extensible Markup languages would be? well, this would make him absolutely greatest Web-development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantappartments; now long on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarise: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaport; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantappartments; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer's community is based not only that is all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantappartments; to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantappartments; allows webdevelopers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. through the program compromises they can have to remember; expand without any other scripting language tax. (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a quick web development and has quickly expanded to a well-engineered editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detail documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta executable).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon sequel @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not based on the oldest entry.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see in the section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project precondition, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts with inserting from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; -shots, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a form of formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; copy, which is the correct way to inserting specific characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert from & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turns into the blockselection or out. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions, to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the news window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and switching of problem conditions at the bottom of the & quantapace; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the toolbar from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries or next, depending on the position of the Cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmark from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantappartments; -projects are stored with the file address .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. that allows, for example, to copy video files into your project folder or a subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and whether you have downloaded another input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantappartments; the project managed. in Chapter & quantappartments; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in Project You / toolbar and are only in this menu, if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this created just the name. actions need to be set by settings actions... added. tooling will be saved via tooling tool, or you'll be asked when you want to save the tool.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the visual range. it does not delete them from hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantappartments; -team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the charging machine tools to access the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; that you or somebody else did and convert into the & quantappartments; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Download / refresh the duck from the & DTD; it is useful if the entities should be removed from the & DTEP; if this global is not present and a writing process in the global KDE folder is not present, fails the store.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags, which are present in the currently invited tool. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is in the tags menu a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the intelligent insertion of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantappartments; inserting using the toolbar, if this day refers to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-ins menu the available plug-ins are listed under the above-mentioned menu points. click on it. click a activated plug-ins deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syncing mode for the current file. the list of available herrings schemata depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developer. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on selected & DTD; using the external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate conversions between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the carrot mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is displayed in & quantapace; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting a single one, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Turns the status of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantapace; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influences each application using the KHTML Part, including the & Konqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the Editorfensters. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbox, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse's environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantappartments; is a high-quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaport; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom, as for example after filling the project, the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering the name file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantapos; -project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small case letters and without blank spaces with the enlargement webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server-address of the machine, which you want to access, one, except one edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemple) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocols are used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the tool can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem to the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. with the running script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to do differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Angehakt leave if files, which are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started anew, not angled.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are shown within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by clicking or, by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project attributes in the sub-window profile or with the shortcut Shift; F7 will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard is possible) which can be ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplemental option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when opening the project. in fact, more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The debugger can be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the debugger plug can be adjusted with the button Options. in case, the debug is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles uploading uplift profiles (see in) as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile, by displaying an own construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edit or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window configuration, you can switch event action and add these actions to change or delete these actions if a previously specified event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it is opening & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot currently affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantappartments; closed, the project file will automatically store. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantappartments; altered files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project construction gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder can be defined as well, however the entries are opening and open with... in connection with the right mouse-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploading files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button is remote to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and is forgotten by programing. this option is useful when common uploading files is necessary and the rather safe password on the record can not be stored in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you change your opinion before the flood.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantappartments, many high-speed profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto different servers. in editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified Domainname or IP address will work.</seg>

<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. through simple exchange of view, various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings tool-toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantappartments, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantappartments; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tooling in & quantappartments; best to do across the menu toolbar. use and add. the add of tooling will be treated below in the section Add of tool.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either using the right-click menu (right click on the toolbar), allow other actions to remove toolbar, modify toolbar or execute toolbar, which can be specified in dialogue, where actions can be displayed on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, will additionally remove the entries and execute action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are included in the essential document skeleton, code cutlet and files to connect. & quantappartments; uses basically just like a commonly used filesystem with expansive organization and interfaces. templates have been introduced in & quantappartments; in approximately the restrictions you set out for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantappartments; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template, before using exactly.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, so images, and PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the pre-firing tree among global templates. further information on the templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special rumours for the purpose and organise the work in appropriate way to be efficiently. some examples may be found in the prejudicial tree among global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful when not a new document is to be inserted based on a template, but the same text area over and over again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to Javascript or Perl's basis. some examples are found in the padlock tree among global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are designed for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organised in a complied tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantappartments.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File as a template and save as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project position) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the pre-firing tree under projections.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File When References. alternatively, you can save a selection as a local / repository location. alternatively, the selection can easily be drawn to cessation and derives on the construction view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy into one device folder. it can be used to use all file management functions, such as pulling and derivates or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder right and backup site template, but of course it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projections allow a very target-oriented approach. you can insert headers and footheaders or dynamically with & PHP; create, create files or connect with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files set in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / Templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button on the folder and in the context menu features to choose from. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled when Elterous attributes expires.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for the stem folders in the pre-hand view. if a regular folder was so set, it would appear explicitly in this path. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear explicitly with something like text building. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to locate or set text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines and footer-lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to cover a folder of speakers in a folder with special Headlines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can press the right-click menu (click on the right button of the mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste of templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantappartments; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the menu view. the first mode is replacing the editing window in two parts: source code Editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch when needed to source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -Editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor on a document, which contains & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandescence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; furthermore, the source code editor is necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously changes both in the source code Editor and in VPL; -Editor synchronized. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, this mode is already active, puts the active cursor from one window to another, while the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The sync position between the VPL; -Editor and the source text editor is adjustable using settings Quanta. you can choose between synchronisation according to a click or automatically. in addition, the selection automatically can be set up for the time. basically, the recommendation applies: a small spanne for fast computer and a wide range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose the document features. thus, the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor will also be called for as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor will be created. this is the reduction of the suspension code. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document themselves e.g. tags for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows the change of content, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta-elements. editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-stylist by pressing on the file-open button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the Cursors is as in a text processing, possible by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor is odd. the marker works as usual. text can be inserted through insertion and by means of reuse or removing button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The inserting of tags is made in the same way via the toolbox, such as in the source text editor. it is to note that inserting tags before existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded by text, any other embracing anchor has to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolsets just like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they are later working in & VPL; function, in this release, the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of style equipment. in contrast to other programs for styles, the search for specific elements is possible and the version of style can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with installed readline library, you can browse the arrows to / from the commands of the previously planned orders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than an argument. quotes may be used to pass composite expressions as an argument. & eg; "as an argument, a holding point in a file called" break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot; "set.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The gathering was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and had simultaneously changed the influx of many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result had numerous conflicts coincide.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what was changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the retraction had changed. that result was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within a row and changes to white characters. later, a lot more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, just copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the same and composite of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file-browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two people will work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. in this editor you can even edit the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three quantum files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also at the same and perform complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Cdiff3; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of current colour monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if rows differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble anymore, if Yemen and the submission will change.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal and the other differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color signifies that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files are the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the typing work by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 Ordin1 Ordin1 Ordin1 folder-3 folder-3 Ordin1 folder 1 Ordin3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to enter the manual-type of filenames, selecting the file-browser (File...) or select one last time. you don't have to specify the third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the same or perform of folders. if for A file is selected, for B and C a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filenames from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When combined, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify a output file. you can also do this step later on Save.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / perform.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you do not have to select any files, you can easily connect the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and derivates: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would have to load two appropriate files, it in & kdiff3; download and then compare it. now, you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you cannot draw anything out & kdiff3; only the cading release of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and derivation of text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Ede info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest a while above the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three swelling are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (these presets can be modified via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees the color which file differs. if both files differ, the color color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's the next section (perform together).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the column column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some cases where white signs are not so important, it's useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the column column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the particular source file has no lines. if the sign-change is activated, the line is displayed on the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the added issue:, the filename and [Gechanges] when you have processed the result. usually it contains the automatic composite already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! up to all conflicts are dissolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to next / unsolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference in the same time has to be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the box column in one of the windows, the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.) This group will then be highlighted the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for the current range and on the left hand appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic editing, or by manual do not have any further line remaining in the group; then this text is displayed in the quota; this text is only a wildcard for the case that you change your mind, and perhaps again select a different source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; the conflict-conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources selected the options numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating the arrow using the mouse and the mouse, but you can also use the arrows on the left, right, high, down, page on, side, end, Strg-beginning and Strg end, siw as you are also used by other programs. the overclock-column can also be used by other programs as well.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eyabewindow you can also use the other keys to edit. with the insert button, you can switch between insertion and transcribing mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merger columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already in the section) and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-image downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. note that & kdiff3; all not automatically resolved conflicts also after the manual resolve to be considered conflict. therefore, it must be separated from resolved and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to press the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-insert). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, automatically copy into the clipboard and the manual coupling. be careful with this option but carefully overwrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Signs are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix-variants use a line-based sign\, and Win32-based systems use Wagener + Zeilenvortex\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the drawing end of the source files not with, therefore you should use & kdiff3; not use with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be automatically saved while the next start. (menu Applicenced - &gt; Kdiffuser...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue will also contain scripts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in short script. if the chosen script does not support this account, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colours, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be represented. on these systems the button presets automatically presents an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, when pressing the tabs button, the appropriate number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabular character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the submission of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied into the clipboard. the manual copy into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same of files tries & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step is not ignoring each line. in this step white signs will not be ignored. also, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon beam '\' at the end of a line, others only save a row-bub '\'. usually, if this option is activated, you will be treated with different sizes in the page-on-side comparison, however, such as a white character. during which, this option has to be deactivated. in default, this option is downlighted.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis are numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic-routing mode, this option determines how long the result of the selection is displayed, before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters. this is useful when white signs are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the features elecle A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the composite menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignore ignororiere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan of folders and transmissions. look for details on documentation to the directory comparison and contractution.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already a previous version exists, then the original version depends on the Suffix .orig. if a file exists with the Suffix .orig, it will be erased without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program. you have to stop & kdiff3; stop and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set over the control centre there.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection of the codes for coding appears a brief indication of what the local encoding is. (this can not be changed here and has a pure informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and assembled with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you edit a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be working with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the editor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this in order to suppress heredits of changes in white characters in the text or viewpoints. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignore ignororiere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overclock column. by selecting A & B; C, A & B; C; C, A & B; C; C is shown beside the normal nor a second overclock column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would rather like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just add the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window next to each other or overhead. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click will work together. a simple click will start collecting and using the filename of the last source file as pre-established names for output file. (if this function is used to recompose it again, then the name of the last used file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be delivered first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function, e.g. to cut any disturbing parts or to correct the return.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is used only when drawing up this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow the user to gain more flexibility in setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it yourself. the good news is however, that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-editor to convert the entry into large letters: sed's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems are using some keywords:\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kde3. but it's good as an example for another pre-processing command line for line-off. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' and ']' is a hit, and each hand is replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'However, perl needs some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the added'\ '.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and composing. the further operations only change the data, which sees the line-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to work in a folder multiple files. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively compare and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for every object; you can adapt the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate this and shows the simulated changes without really perform them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... introduces selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and run of individual files very similar. you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are assembled, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not match the together, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will receive a small news window on the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then were compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is closed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left-hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder which has been found during scan, is shown here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can double-click a folder by clicking on the + / - or using the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions and subfolders with which you can open all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file will be restarted and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the date type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the date type is different from the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the contraction action may not be automatically selected. if that will be run together, you will be informed about problems of this kind once again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries differ.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be the same as its overall content is identical. then, you also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet back, which is only green, then yellow is and later, if it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. when a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, it may not run together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. when a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, it may not run together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action to reinstall both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: assembled and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the composite is copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are assembled and select the option new file instead of merger (unsafe), then appears a error error: files are different, but the date is identical.. if such errors are not eliminated, it may not run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the composite a file is decomposed after the other one. it status column indicates, if that occurred together successfully, and correspondingly other messages, if something emerges, you should make a final review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the furnishing dialog the file-method full-permanent analysis is selected, Kde3 will show more columns. these contain the number of unresolved conflicts, not whiter and white conflicts. (the column for solvable conflicts will only appear if three folder compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected record (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the assembling actions (also in all subfolders), you can perform this together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then will be used in three-folder mode C as the target, in the two-folder mode, B is chosen as the target and used to sync a B and / or B as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check out if all entries are displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to pass through the specific entries. check these options to avoid undisturbed surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries: choose directory-assembled / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only execute the current record: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist together, a message appears to be pointing to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you perform all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options average, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose simulate if you want to see what would happen, without having to change the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& Cdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual surgery is required (assembled a single file), then a composite window will pop up (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, choose again directories, continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake you will find a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with it.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If a few entries have been combined individually, you notice & kdiff3; this entries (in the current session) and execute them again later. even if here it has been swapping or not saved, these entries are considered to be completed. only if you change the composite action, these entries are brought together again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiffuser up...) now has a section called directory gathering with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree. there are multiple patterns to be entered. separate space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folder must not correspond to this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree; it can be more than one pattern to be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid Placeholder: '*' and '?' default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not shown in the elementary tree; it can be more than one pattern to be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid Placeholder: '*' and '?' default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many autonomous files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder-specific with an .cvsignal file can be adjusted. (see below: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a fold attribute. in other filesystems, a moving point. a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links indicate. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folder are treated and recursively searched. a link to a folder of a link on itself would lead to a findloop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Results an exhaustive analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of solder, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binding analysis, and much slower, if it is applied to files that do not contain any text. (give an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder via a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changelation date and file size. however, this speed prediction will cost you a certain degree of security. please use with caution. this option is pictured in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to familiar to the changelist date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered to be identical if when copying the amendment of the amendment. please use with caution. this option is pictured in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode if two folders are compared and no target folder. in this mode, the proposals are identical. also the results of the composite of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered uncertain because the other file is not also changed. you should consider this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version is renamed with the .orig extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal composite folder, not only the composite folder. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder-together view is visible to the composite individual files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file using double-clicking. nevertheless, in the directory menu, you can also merge an appropriate menu item. if you save the result, the current file is assembled, and the file will not be combined once you run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"" "however, this status is lost if you once again read the directory: list menu: new einread" ""</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed Archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively long or contain.. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masculine. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit any permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (please note the option familiar with the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main use of the purpose is currently considered as differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts the built-in differences. in order to start Kdiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a box, it takes a patch file in the Unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. furthermore, please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is irrelevant if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the same from two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that together or the same of folders, is not supported in the KPart Mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heis es compare) there are already. besides, the name Kdiff3 has already pointed out that it can perform together as the program diff3 out of the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL-programs quite long and have learned a lot by watching in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or let him go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and told the configure script probably not the correct prefix to KDE. in the default installed configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this is is, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. however, this important information is simply lost by clicking in the code text and select the button A / B / C. however, this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is much effort to create extra a private file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can re-recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly up; no src lineels; no src has been published and the text cannot delete itself. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Cdiff3; uses already many colors to distinguish from differences. even more excitation would be confusing and lacks the purpose. use another editor.</seg>

<seg id="2483">The default setting is enlarged and likes; the area around the mouse-cursor. alternatively, you can & kmag; make a select screen display in the magnifier window (selection mode) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse-cursor in the magnifier window and hold the left mouse button down, so you can set the content of the magnifier and move. this also goes with the arrows.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key, push or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, as soon as the mouse-cursor a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from the RSI syndrome (repetitive-ray syndrome) and those of any mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, as soon as the mouse-cursor takes a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who emulate the repetitive straight into inflation (RSI) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this, however, requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain using the click of the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also get pain that breaks with the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it even though: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain caused by the damage due to the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result may vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and carries out a mouse-click, once you break the motion shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart deslide is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after the push of the mouse button emulates. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before the slogan of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can execute the pulling off the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the pulling off the mouse button. the smart debuds requires a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This weighttime must be petalled by the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse-click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If smarter switched on, the rotate field is switched off (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button, before moving the mouse button again, if there is no reason for the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; supports now the click by mouse-postponement. if this feature is activated, creates a slow shift because of right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow shift to the left and back takes a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool; the first time it will be started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction times. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, it is started & kmousetool; at any start from & kens; currently this function is currently available under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please note the relevant documentation to find out how to start the program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values that were submitted to opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button to the user, the settings will be reset to the booth after the last push of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best use & kmousetool; first use the preference. in particular, the smart slide you should first turn off. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the smart slide.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to decrease the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains at no effect: the clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window, which does not represent a link, leads not to unwinding reactions. therefore, you can park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckled, you should clean your mouse. this is usually fairly simple. the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to pick out the mouse-ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse differently. however, it should be quickly clear if you view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the bullet, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt road can be easily scratched with a flat blade or fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if just a different departure has been started. if in this case you use the smart slide, this means that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer able to quit through the release of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you are using & kmousetool; using a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run yourself a mouse click. here, the status of & kmousetool is reset, and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another passage.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you are a shortcut reactions. so secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas for the mouse-cursor and menus and the front-lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent hardship, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Smart deslide is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it in the clipboard and re-insert any other action, in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice here:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart slide if you just start using & kmousetool; please select text instead as follows: execute the switch button down, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and once again move the mouse button down.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this way, if & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when in the intelligent dispatch the different period begins. later you can use the smart deslide even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; it should be installed on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and those who are preparing the toilers of the mouse pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button off. in this way can also the pulling and derive with the mouse can be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters will be processed text before going to the speech of speech dispatcher. they are useful for enhancing the pronunciation to replace incorrect words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and spokesperson or to circumvent certain deficiencies of languages and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">"" "the" "" "Screen" "" "issue has the highest priority. it is pulled aside all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the orders received are continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning have the next priority. this step is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the most high-highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page, you can welcome with & kmouth; someone welcome that straight the room. & kmouth; alerts are also news. read here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textorders. each order which you have from the Carteicard orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are thought for the output longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are shipped in queue, except the issue of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue will be stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen recurrent. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text presentations as well as on & kde; -News applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there may be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts can specify either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with pre-defined strings such as: -) through text or for a formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to transform & XML; from a format to a different format. within the scope of delivery, some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker-opters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which sent the text to & ktts; if you have set a female voice for example, you can read text by KDE messages about it. Siehe can read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a language output. if the filter is fixed, its rules will not apply, it gives the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text message, a message, warning or a & box; sent to & ktts; sent it by all activated filters, shown on the page below. the processing through the filter is carried out in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and you will see the next furniture dialogs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of strings, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. these patterns are exchanged in the text, then the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type a name for your filters. you can choose this name as you like, he only has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column. the list is being processed from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; to allow users to create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings at the & kcontrolcenter; shown. the module settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers have to be fully installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf: the device at all displays and setting the network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at installing & Linux; installed and furnished. network devices later added, the drivers must be loaded via adaptation of the following files, accordingly to the kernel release:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module netsettings is loaded when the config settings is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this system will automatically detect the system to detect the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release points best corresponds to. by selecting the setting non-once-ask, the definition can be permanent. at the next start of the network settings, this selection is automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode. previously, all options are displayed grey, which means the settings can only be viewed through clicking the button management mode at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the total functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button-button... in a dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button below and shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode, TCP / IP settings will be required for each system start. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information on each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selective list can be selected either DHCP or BOOTP according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP address. in the input field IP address must be specified the desired TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask is set to set the subnetwork mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system is initializing the network interface in the boats. if the initialisation is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name replaced by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers request only IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>

<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains any known machine some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. these are still available in the test or in the future version 4.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, you have to switch to a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distribution (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply download the rpm package and in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface, such as kicks or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kens is sufficient, but additionally the development packages are necessary with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second, all of & knetwork.conf file will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network are conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great spread. from IPv6, it is expected to be consistent in the near future. this description is therefore focusing on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is aware of. in foreign networks, at & eg; work is the network administrator which addresses a valid IP address, or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen as easily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so your use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet can be made for such machines by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 uses. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called standard route, the 2nd to the loopback address (localhost = the own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The PS7.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files, which are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections, some other content is to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindexes file with the band's content. this process sets all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This makes a backup profile created with the currently marked files and the default settings. you can set up the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current operating folder in which the backup should be made. the list of insured files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed below backup files, applies that only those files are stored in the same file system, such as the folder. folders, which are on other filesystems, you can apply separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files that have changed since then have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file prior to the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; lt; and lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be set up:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-retention variant of the band's device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & box; before the tape is empowered loading of the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option turned on to block & kdate; to block the throw at the belt drive. maybe this setting does not work with all banddrives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & kdate; automatically the tape is kicked off. use this option not at Floppy Streamners.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option turned on to change & box; the hardworking block size for the belt drive. not all drives support variable blockages. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to & b; in any case the blocksize for your belt work is shared.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If this file is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the gang. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the file content is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, with the host name of the full name of the system, in which the tape is formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the time the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdate /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives directly with & GNU; - tar leave. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -observer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, users access quickly access to information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer in the background makes. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 possesses & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot places & ksystemlog; functions are available with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily filtered and sort. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting up & ksystemlog; initially, the main protocol of the system - the system protocols - will not appear, and it opens up instead of a small news window, so you do not have a small news window. the protocol files are usually found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually does not have a permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a written criterion. the list of the log-lines is now automatically changed, so that only log-lines are displayed. in default, a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. select the string of the filter button then only with the entries in the selected column. select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent, which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a conspicuous color as a protocol lines of level indication. the color representation of protocol lines can be connected to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system Protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can get the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to switch new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open up additional subwindows and manage. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dump, you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & box; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following as named as & ksysv;. this section runs a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts at the high-cycle of the system in the & Linux world. this is why it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could attempt to convert a machine to system V Init without having a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service that you want to start at the high-level of the system or switching onto another runtime. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like settes, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems possess this file, even if there is actually not much use for this. you can also want to create a rc.it in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line in the starting field as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you have achieved something, then you'll be repaired by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you are not correct files. instead, each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually launch these scripts in hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one includes a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple type, machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level, which leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; running. furthermore, I could also have a user runtime, the & eg;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln, or change the position within a level by changing it somewhere else. this will only happen when it comes out of its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pick up an entry from the range of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you simply drag them into a new area. to simply select them from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of one item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you must edit the sorting entries of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no possibility to reestablish entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone an entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runtime with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of a order manually, press the input button to change the features dialog. use the tabs button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to shed the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln and now the machine starts steady. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started in these distributions, simplify the configuration for the proprietary furnishings of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution please check if all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without a message when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you have to save it. either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry to store in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two cart cards, the user and the user's list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some shaft cards are only represented if you have enabled advanced system settings (Quota) for users if you can make individual settings on which you can make individual settings. additional ticket cards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD unixen are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Carteid Password administration appears if Shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -unixen are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This piece map appears only if for at least one connected filesystem data limited (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quotas user / quota group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, while the placements are stored in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted separately for each filesystem. the current file system is selected by means of the field file filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Carrier-card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by using it in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu users or group or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot word, remove and modify the time to the booting of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, modify, modify operating systems, modify, modify and more.</seg>
