although I visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I danced to American music , American authors have read and run his sport .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me , that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist .
in the 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff the murder@@ ous conspiracy of a oil magn@@ ates who had his interest to be inclined to occupy .
I was caught .
free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , it is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you are always that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about xen@@ ophobia and racism this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me , how he walks with his min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you says so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ dents and Women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won at the Republi@@ can election was the highest number , who ever reached a candidate from the party .
I was spee@@ ch@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , asked me ?
I could not reconcile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like for instance my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , the people from all over the world , was a deep @-@ growing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , tr@@ umps world@@ view does not agree with the members of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ us &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ umps In@@ intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she adap@@ ts to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those through them embo@@ died values deep my love for America .
while trac@@ ting his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can Presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for p@@ umping because they either share his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , almost broke my heart .
maybe it is unfair to call the trac@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respectful and implies an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not considered .
could it be that these voters , of which most knows , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed it ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down differently with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words from white in attacks on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as she@@ ds light ) , as the great Van Jones called , exactly what America did so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one may always have , America is welcome .
for that land elected as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with manifold , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation of Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a vo@@ ke &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ continued the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answering them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vote and speaker @-@ strong &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words , &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and this breaks me my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love of music by garbage
the &quot; Commons Instruments &quot; from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the community : one of children and adults of the existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and bonds .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope .
the young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .

music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero children play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material :
music with revi@@ ved instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling , under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , have begun to turn parts of the case into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ets , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , bass bass , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classic music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ette and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local econom@@ ist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the start time :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the children worked in the trash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o has been shown something he had never seen before : one out of waste produced violin .
today there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from res@@ umed material and which is called The Commons Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws up the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tonnes of garbage every year .
those who live with him and live from him are the poorest - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational spectacle from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of the Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and team work effectively fight for illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that battles the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already been operated in li@@ bre@@ anic waters of illegal fishing , before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ ded accordingly and less inclined to welcome a lo@@ bre@@ wing of this type on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles are mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refused to give him a fishing effort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that was discovered and followed by the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
ultimately it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of the fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and safegu@@ ards , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) was established .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; thus , we have eight countries that are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other where there is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , absent for it extremely difficult to divide . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fisheries once were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , updates on susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a period of port .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ ects travel routes - such as such that a ship invites his captured fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fisher@@ man license , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a pen@@ al ister .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can refuse to refuse such ships in their ports . what means that ships can not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to attract more than 20 million USD on lost sales , who lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
to their practices include promotions as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit roy@@ papers , indication of ph@@ antasy , the fish@@ ings protected species and fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are targeted on the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ bound@@ less control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could be illeg@@ ally represented and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You dar@@ ing my port to run &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal gor@@ g@@ hole tried to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has criminal networks exposed to distributed counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has been prosec@@ uted and found ships .
thanks to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances and preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our examinations lead us pretty much into the networks organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ icious vessels to spot more precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , also helps to divide the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and this we try to cross through , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oce@@ ana platform that offers platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite channels and by which the position can be displayed on each ver@@ itable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to examine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only criminal , but they are also deter@@ red .
ships used sooner without license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile had a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped Gre@@ ko 1 found , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these achievements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa tens of hundreds of millions of dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is certainly more illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report his first great triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the move under false flag . and not only was the ship even without a license and were used under tow@@ ing networks , which now is prohibited .
the ship was still penetr@@ ated into bot@@ tom@@ ed waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 found a strong sign that it goes against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

your article will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is moving further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of crossing the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum held by the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the amendment of the opposition to a referendum held on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country , in which they gathered themselves to the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) can be found both images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in central northern parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country has deterior@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute shortage of food and drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance for a fundamental change in the Am@@ t@@ sen@@ tia of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . however , it was finally blocked by re@@ taining a re@@ election by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting in Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izing the following article in the context of the administration of the government :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary and violence is estimated to be among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new governance .

on Twitter are frequent images that tell of conflicts , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves proposed the news of police oppression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to keep up the police forces , among them also this woman in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear redness , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ als do not have !
meanwhile , there is already an Inf@@ ogra@@ graphic that forms the extent of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an am@@ en@@ sen@@ th@@ process - this was now proven in the eyes of many inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .

this is an adap@@ ated version of a interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was released on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city CÃ³rdoba .
now as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same names as his father contribute to the brutal military per@@ ations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of his secret .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ tur@@ ers and murder@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ce . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret services 141 in prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archiving .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who was charged with ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent with her child and how this child chose the path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was rounded with a boy who made combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an ar@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP .
pass merely on that they will not lead you one day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ ists army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; party in Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father loved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ ag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ da ro@@ ams are tor@@ tured the prisoners &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything of it was stolen .
he gave me a little wrapped in a ceiling and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I moved in and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on the human being .
it looked like a dirt bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attach it to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
she rarely grows a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and j@@ umped on it a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ der .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were inter@@ cep@@ ted .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men face the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , humans silent on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I paid &quot; Why did you come to me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father told him about it .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there was a man together and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civil , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
the following video gives Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military , I was in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ mare a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one takes on an enemy that man has fought .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always asked myself how my father , the leader of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I never fell into a house to penetrate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you that thou shou@@ ld@@ st take the cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
to do that , we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then on which I bore a jacket and a roll swe@@ aters made of wool . both were my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , accused of being accused of being a pity into this crime . I didn &apos;t refu@@ te it , they can put a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to pronoun@@ ce out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older I find Re@@ ue .
I have children . if one has only one children , one sees the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
well , you have ex@@ hal@@ ted so during the dictatorship of man . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children lead ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have simply been able to bring them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies disappear ?
had these people not also families where one could commit their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they hol@@ lowed machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been de@@ pressed and somewhere else - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course remains always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it , I have nothing against the military .
I was even in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
the thought , show my father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I did not blame him for all of the atrocities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have never killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly upon me and asked me what the whole exaggerated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they supposedly defended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he only ref@@ utes &quot; Na then &quot; remember . &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I delivered the first ad .
I had finally recognised that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can throw me that I have been taken . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest standing before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among them severe , un@@ lawful liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the scale of the magnitude of the jungle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ ber@@ a trial ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 .
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the court imposed in 28 cases lifel@@ ong detention and in nine cases off@@ ences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was free check .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by Am@@ t@@ personnel . # Es@@ war@@ heads
all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military relatives , former police officers and civilian employees .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organizations who have worked for victims for years to justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 founded Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government was transferred to the country at La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial place , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation errors makes aging people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which you can make its driving licence .
the photo was common in the social media .
arrangement of the original photos from Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can leng@@ then its driving license , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ bl@@ iss@@ ful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ gh sha ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - maybe even with Bo@@ arding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # 82@@ 12 ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
arrangement of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , fell . he was also who pointed out the local time .
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ er drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) later by the proper name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Kyoto apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the bug was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was released .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows via the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people are offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; scary &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of an older driver . according to the police , the proportion of older car drivers who are involved in accidents , are quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors . this represents a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents reduced in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the name not named repor@@ ters brought comments to the light in the published version of the article comments to the light which show that prejudices some Japanese seems to be against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; how faul@@ ty is the translation at all , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that it is a real translation errors . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true locality for this bizarre error in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
in addition , you need two important skills : passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of native language . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers .
such a French native speakers , for example , translate the English language - not from the French into English .
photo by Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue that could produce translations into English . this may be lacking in lack of understanding for over@@ sight , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees , make translations of their own business internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose Engl@@ ish@@ man are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the verb@@ s and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases which are created by machine translation , show that this technique can not substitute for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the most stran@@ gely English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .

translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the internet and on television
main site of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Shipping ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ elan Internet users use that they have no access to the online transm@@ itter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet access from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV can be no longer accessible .
other online broadcast@@ ers over@@ taken recordings of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection has been worked , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activated your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider are re@@ locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ zol@@ es with Internet access mainly in periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 in the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission would continue to report to people with fin@@ es and lock@@ ers when they continue to report on demonstrations , since the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amaz@@ ingly , that is still cheaper than buying two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT in@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itter . this also affects the website where the National Assembly has handed over their meetings .
previous research inquiries made by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had resulted in the local Internet provider to be used to buy DNS . this is a technique that may respond to the DNS server requests from certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds to incorrect or deny the request by calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third sal@@ ted channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V @-@ cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Caracas , took place in custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police @-@ food .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on show again .
although some channels can still be accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : thus the Vene@@ zol@@ es of access to multi media coverage about the current events in the country is increasingly difficult .
in Paraguay many girls will get slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collects from testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of truste@@ es , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; f@@ ading cows , falling schools &quot; ) published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not able to dine together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange receives the child food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to do so countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and sacrifice abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t be up@@ lift up in the context of a contract .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies @-@ telling , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things by name , as the feeling of Gr@@ ati@@ tude , which is vacc@@ inated to the cri@@ adi@@ tas , guarantees in general breastfeeding .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no education or might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is bl@@ ister@@ ing , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they even learn from it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon that takes place in the dark in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itÃ¤@@ ran@@ ny Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the residence office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested as long as having a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
she stressed that the assass@@ inated child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep @-@ rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest leaders and demanded that there are &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay is more cows than children registered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for an excellent investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n is indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a fall of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to judgment .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas will not only be exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ si , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and started to sell on the street or on the market place to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for their employer .
Friday for example clean@@ se the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ in@@ fied the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner they had done with learning , the more leisure had it .
but also this time was limited because they had never had dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it never had to star@@ ve , but I didn &apos;t get an unlimited meal . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ edi@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the house@@ holder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand beside him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media about the regime of dict@@ ator no faith .
he kept them for intelligent , but remained not with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; you allowed me not often to visit my family because they think I would be &quot; poor habit &quot; again , &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ i , speak to their native language Guaran@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they had the education they had enabled her to lose again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you were completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them , with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the ra@@ ils to which cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite anyone to my home . I had no friend@@ ships at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of it .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers as a semi @-@ slaves had to be considered ) and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers as a semi @-@ slaves had to be considered ) and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers as semi @-@ slaves had to be considered ) and the native population will move into a system of slavery in which they will be light victim for abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed to a bill with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register for social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , a place would then be set up , which is in order to give citizens a permission to give social media .
within six months with acceptance of the law , us@@ her@@ ers and users should register on the site of the site with their proper names and personnel numbers to make use of social networks .
will it neglect to do so , that could bring a sentence from up to six months in prison or a money @-@ bu@@ b .
the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video clips and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities want to rise up the user . it is not clear how the Egyptian authorities are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul saddle , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and user received a us@@ ername and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; executive researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I have doubts strongly in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology .
in my opinion , they suggest that the same as they control the physical public and private rooms can also be done online .
if I take them seriously , then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to apply citizen or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to take them to a court process .
this is not at all means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed by the legislative parliament and the constitutional committees , before it goes into the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in the parliament , where control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no dis@@ sent@@ ing Nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the MEP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ k proposed a pre @-@ sentence against cy@@ ber crime , in which a lifetime sentence for those provided that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq , the Ti@@ mies is working with H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of leop@@ ards who ro@@ de through Africa and Asia are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find fewer loot , at risk .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; how R@@ aza shows in the video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a great rob@@ bery is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore places that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera all , cr@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ o , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , the progress made for the northeast Japan has been made in the last six years to re @-@ establish the life of those who were affected by the &quot; Trinity disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a Tsun@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ f@@ ect pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring st@@ ov@@ ary of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ata were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities from the map .
even more , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , already alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants left their houses .
the Special Report by Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows which progress has been reached after six years to re @-@ establish the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ata
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( the s@@ cu@@ be , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ata .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i has seen the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts have been completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Iw@@ ata has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is with 70 percent the final light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , one is still striving for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of accommodation shel@@ ters ( to be used , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and Iw@@ ata lived in such expe@@ ditions .
nearly 40 percent of 2011 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , which after the disaster in expe@@ ditions , were moved to final homes .
for Iw@@ ata the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday work in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
like the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the disaster , have opened their doors to December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the Fish@@ eries in Iw@@ ata and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been put into operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing vessels have res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have moved in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agr@@ arian @-@ land @-@ extensively in compassion .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in Iw@@ ata and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Pre@@ fecture , tourism has recovered further again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and Iw@@ ata are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it feels more difficult to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper resulted in numerous surveys among the native population and under the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their recep@@ tivity has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more beyond the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the position of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima did not only need to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of disaster was also a witness of the worst , disaster disaster , nuclear accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been settled in permanent spare houses .
at the booth of 2017 , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are still living outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ s , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are still in expe@@ ditions , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper accommodation projects . this is the projects that compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Iw@@ ata and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we handle themes which often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices based on a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over voice and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Cri@@ kon@@ i explains about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini tells about how the love of music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the times when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday he had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . nationally , millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and have now moved him into artificial coma .
its state is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
in the pictures too , the face of the police officers is also identified with a guard . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been de@@ vised by the conclusion of the incident of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be audi@@ ted by an prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video via Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided the video on the net in which you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers , and several sanctions briefly on it to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been divided into social networks several times .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with approval .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father , because he has attacked the Occup@@ y Movement of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station after he has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has defeated him with a percussion &apos;s face .
police attack
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil when the police came to brutal police against demonstrators last Friday .
polic@@ emen stayed at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again the Brazilian media street prot@@ ru@@ des again by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported deliberately over a crus@@ hing glass windows to be illustr@@ ative with a photo their title page illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o prefer@@ ed a title story with a set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than about the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing .
this must also be recognised when strictly against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , un@@ proportionate significance , and the typical violence of military police are tu@@ fted by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstrators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar @-@ plants in all Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Pop@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of what there is no noteworthy sugar @-@ harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the su@@ gars .
after the decline , the sugar raw materials in the region lay still , and the factory lost gradually after its installations , until only the rum@@ ours of steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some of them rarely change the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a sol@@ der veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar consumption is not rus@@ hed to his sleep .
he heard that there are in the east of the sugar cane factories , who are back in operation after a long time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I would receive the su@@ gars factory , but the promise was not kept .
the su@@ gars industry have already contradic@@ ted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country several decades ago , but the bad harvest have already been no news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar factory turned off ?
the old railway line of the church saw already better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar consumption industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar hr@@ ag@@ ans were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased over a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the sugar @-@ sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the breastfeeding of a total of 98 su@@ gars , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sug@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is repeated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly all those surv@@ eyed are the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut .
so that the place is preserved , they set up a full @-@ time working group .
before the first end of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially established documents that were removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , which differ@@ ed from the addres@@ sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ i Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could authori@@ ze any resolution .
from there the responsibility became over and the letters were more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still operating sug@@ ro@@ ar factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the lac@@ tation of the factory , in which he helped him .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled up one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ flows has been removed .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for jobs and services , which generated the facilities in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech from 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for closing the su@@ gars
the sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich got to change many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the su@@ gars factory closed , or better said than they began to un@@ equi@@ p them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted this , and also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were used to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty received the old soldiers a pensions of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ ded person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to R@@ ente with 65 years old , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with issues that are important to them . they do this through Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour has been launching mobile Ton@@ studios directly to schools and youth centers , in order to bring youth @-@ groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were directed by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop will thus rise to the young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o is told in the territory of the tribe of the kit@@ um - First Nation in British Columbia , also called &quot; Highway &quot; tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video player to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous tongues , although the young people had not always master@@ ed the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation received , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an stands at the St@@ rop@@ he in Um@@ br@@ ella , as well as a translation into English , translated here into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me .
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day where you will take our cry .
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that one day we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and proceed as well as our youth
so they can do what they determined the Creator
in the commentary box , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verses in Sil@@ en@@ ese ( which is also published on his blog ) :

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are near to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ i@@ u ( meaning of the s@@ cu@@ be that the plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) were issued by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small companies that make up those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese people , these plastic dishes usually are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is transformed today in show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ j@@ u show .
now in special sale : new with plastic lacqu@@ ered mobile phones , as they are shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y gathering , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets :
here are a few sho@@ ebo@@ x cooling cabinet magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ tial Arts is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone @-@ handed .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to watch as an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight expedition .
some mobile phones and mobile @-@ phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and salmon are also used , a popular plate , which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there any one who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can put my mobile phone with laughter @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appeti@@ zing form to be surprised for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ tdown ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ aps from dried salmon .
more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic hair@@ s you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # to the tip of the characters .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the borough of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi who dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the Restaurant Industry . such as the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ j@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes were actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports , foreign media and foreign media over the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the susp@@ end and the displaced persons regularly dive only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy which this battle brings .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grape or the con@@ gregations that have learned to live with the pain .
they are behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of o@@ ves tom@@ bs , the stories of paying parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trade live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people working in the battle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug addic@@ ts and all communities have to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something such as milk .
pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that sits at each weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only a single day , her four si@@ blings , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ ws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have placed to go , and to gra@@ ves according to the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is named Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they did not pay off because that demand a stereo .
where are we to get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and government leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensory journalism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with images that can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only , which is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when going through the streets .
for me it is as if they mo@@ cks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are therefore justified that they were &quot; re@@ eds . &quot;
I think they try to intervene that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main city district : &quot; as a family has been lo@@ oted like a family with threats , &quot; it describes how armed criminal month for month money from their business , until they had destroyed not only the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
pain should never pass , the trauma remains , the fear will come back high if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away from each other , the better .
it included their report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ es . I must learn how to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents worry about them .
Br@@ yan is a father@@ less and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk pul@@ ver@@ ine .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are un@@ important compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother was gone .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw , which was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez saw this :
in 2006 Br@@ yan was born as a crime by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez has been the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings for public security and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ ning per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that are leaving organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade into the soul of the country .
very few stories live on the face of new headlines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alistic project of Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal has been tor@@ tured the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking which has tor@@ tured the country in the past four decades , in intelli@@ gible manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , include images , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a rum@@ or or for@@ ge a for@@ gery .
but what about the years after having emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was mis@@ leading to demonstrate trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
these false cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a petrol trucks tra@@ ded the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of lo@@ op@@ holes that were difficult to carry .
trag@@ ically , the petrol trucks fell victim to the victim .
administration coun@@ cill@@ ors described a fire@@ ball , the Danish houses including a movie nearby , which was full of people , which were filled with the football world champi@@ ons .
houses for@@ ged and shortened p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to in@@ consistency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users my@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multi@@ tier photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows shortened body that are ranked on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end its end .
over the years the same photo was noted several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dramatically of atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse pl@@ agues around streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were cr@@ acked , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army @-@ point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo , when it was mis@@ understood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acres of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ ci@@ ble use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures ; Africa Check has documented concessions on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ acres .
a step further bring personal comments like this example , understand@@ ably the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image from San@@ ge joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a review , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee wounds , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , like the following on , brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which reported 2012 , asser@@ ted that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to address this information .
the original contribution , which was accepted last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations that AF@@ P were referred to as their source , had also attributed to Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not been associated with the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling lasts up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found in the DR Congo ( DRC ) .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private pages , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , others have tried to disp@@ ose the counter@@ fe@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been given examples for the mis@@ used use and associated it with the respective countries on which side they had been published . thus , we want to be more clearly visible than through the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also joined together ) several examples can be used for abuse .
here some cases , which can now be rus@@ hed fully ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country @-@ examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange colored countries point out on pages or servers , about the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ cons are still available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in Gray are examples that are available according to met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also fraud @-@ exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are more confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sides in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) is also no longer fully re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time@@ - / dat@@ en@@ ary stamp exist on the web site and isolated them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original shot of 2010 , the image ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ achable .
frames and pictures
there are two powerful themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that draw these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussion on the silence of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the wor@@ ship@@ ments of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second frame uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers cannot give it a longer faith .
with social media , there are many people who have inten@@ tional to practice the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ gesting this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and fl@@ atter@@ ing it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that rejection of images of a ref@@ usal is equivalent to acknowledge the tragedy . at times these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and spectators are des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the examined , how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techn@@ ologist experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggest something that actually may be used either from the context or in completely mis@@ ci@@ ch@@ able manner .
any examination of false subsidies should also take into account as internationally as it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.@@ D@@ t. insur@@ ability ) endeav@@ ored to offer language avi@@ d a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist are stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or phrase is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese and Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ eca language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ass you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to have made you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ creen language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel after watching in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ ici@@ encies other cultures , revealing the other thought and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; that are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to download their favorite sw@@ am here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ ches of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is at the moment of the worst flood of water and disaster disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , are characterized by strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka , from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missed because of the flood and mud .
over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were killed at 30@@ 4 safe spots .
the rainf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water periods in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ reachable areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the disaster disaster :
high@@ water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water conditions of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ce crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ all are already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday overweight water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five planes for rescue operations and further five are made for transportation of not@@ ches for those made in their flooded villages .
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
if any search and S@@ ail@@ ers Dro@@ h@@ nes need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals in this area need help .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; Hoch@@ wasser@@ hilfe &quot; button , which allows users to retrieve a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ der R@@ ote cross .
similarly , they introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button that had more than thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ ment actions for floo@@ ding water and lands@@ li@@ ous people .
the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need of security and help give assistance to aid .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

it was in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and dear friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next article we are entitled to rights for transfers .
we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and humans , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ys par@@ ables against Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they hear@@ ti@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be Muslim but to different art . but somehow we will all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective idea , that once Muslims , those as I don &apos;t fit there , be hear@@ ed .
Muslim to be demon@@ ized
I am not alone with it alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind , when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox ser@@ ene and jel@@ ly .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , religion was removed from Rum@@ is as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this dele@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims , Western books for centuries @-@ coloni@@ ze .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid led the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also stand forth today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to bro@@ aden them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty scar@@ f are dominating our news@@ letters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are forced to wear their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover sau@@ di Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group gives its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong s@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened Muslim women to lead the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil from Afri@@ cans who had been brought into slaves with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination such as deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the aim of anti @-@ militar@@ ised attacks and ra@@ ils .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
which belong to the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry is amazing to record the s@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to make up here seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that originate from 77 countries .

approved use .
four decades ago , my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ans from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan had re@@ thought of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I aware of the Muslim and American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes , if I ask people why I don &apos;t eat a por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or do my hand@@ some pocket records , all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all pocket kor@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who are trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ made Islam@@ ophobia , thinking and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
due to the stories we tell and due to the way we tell them there is Islam@@ ophobia in more than just a stranger , who gives a wife the head towel .
or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it takes our identity that is so far , versatile and diverse that it is impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim but was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbour , see my rock in the fire , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her the Arab verses for the protection of Refu@@ gee who are defeated the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one you cannot see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow .

it is the picture of her that I see my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings of Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can be easily mem@@ orized .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they had told me if I have a bad day .
to be Muslims , as they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over the centuries - was established by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name hon@@ orary British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant Grand@@ father we@@ ep .
nu@@ g@@ rin , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan urged his family to be ruled by India , family , which he could not close in half a century into his arms .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as with my grandfather , ra@@ ged from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as in the game risk .
to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in front of a century ago above a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ icks of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he introduced the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ itary history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed across every continent aside from Antarc@@ tica , spread in Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide @-@ rate of veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy bl@@ ends the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , which history has reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four thousand years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a liberated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ists called Bil@@ ali Muhammad were ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel , as people filled the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pakist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the in@@ dur@@ acy inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple @-@ time identities , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the s@@ rati@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cu@@ be , but is represented in the reduction of doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to provide me with my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build upon this jun@@ cture of structural ophobia .
structural Islam@@ ophobia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ant who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its limits towards people from the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims to the visor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a science @-@ correct image and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we need to lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to de@@ ze the Muslim or the &quot; Other . &quot;
we are back decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints that we conce@@ de in our news editorial actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslim within the media industry which tries to grasp our many times with ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake seen in the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim ; the viral vide@@ os@@ erie Secret lives of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ lied writers , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakist@@ ani , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global point in which we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason that the conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House would perform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have made Muslims to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by created the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years previously , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate great areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am worried about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old now , as my daughter is now , but who made me to be the inevitable Muslims today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I have left behind here like a Br@@ ot@@ tom@@ ec@@ umen@@ tion in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , like a story , where anyone is made to a &quot; different . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are managed and humans are embr@@ aced by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago by Wissenschaft@@ liches der Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously introduce the &quot; Other &quot; ; as the employment that we have had a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other &quot; people bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ kunst wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now despite a language barrier with someone to connect ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ touch@@ able blog .
however , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written one , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has conducted events already since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children there .
for the creators of the project are :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity of diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to be da@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often in this way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for purposes , these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the listening to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers press their story first in their own language and translate them into English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they conduct their devotion and their account for listening to it .
they call laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative element for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after having explained the importance of his tale , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara will be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide ridge , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS , in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ vis@@ ing of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participated in several religious and civil organisations on a mass demonstration ; the march began at the pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ent Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ zen for the neur@@ examination of debts ) and the E@@ com@@ en@@ ical Church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advocates for the re @-@ establishment of debt also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debt to be held accountable for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial test and a mission statement without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , working conditions of appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be black@@ ma@@ iled and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .

these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures will be danger without the participation and conviction of the citizens risk of being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian we@@ t@@ ler Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , a annual conference dedicated to the digital culture , which is designed in Berlin , dedicated itself to the event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos;s books within three to five days , las@@ en extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ ire ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that was published last year and here Lic@@ enses are available free , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book wants to discuss how moti@@ ons of open knowledge can be built and what the true cost is , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of open knowledge , have worked on page to look over the fog , surrounds our news and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers that incar@@ cer@@ ated in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information on his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we given up to extreme beliefs in this process ?
the Web@@ developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , transferred to an unknown village .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military poli@@ cem@@ an Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly ge@@ heim &quot; recorded by his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and placed them aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
its where@@ ab@@ ort and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le cultural prototypes pres@@ cient as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra virtu@@ ell .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the im@@ itation of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip @-@ pull into the digital arche@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
of course , this project has not yet been completed .
N@@ oura G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and it taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English at even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught other incar@@ nate to write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also taught other incar@@ cer@@ ated how to use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually held one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ vocation , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for one year .
she stir@@ red the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English .
the book is license @-@ free available .
buck@@ led by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is happening on every visit ,
that I have vers@@ ed in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment , in which we embrace
that any of the dangers are no matter ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I change in every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes were Good@@ bye to say
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return soon to my lon@@ eliness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I over@@ produce myself , that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption disp@@ ens@@ ary Director after release of release again on previous posts
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence at the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption was committed .
this is a Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants because of the un@@ tre@@ ad@@ duction of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approx . 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the Mos@@ ambique airports , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and demanded immediately his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , which happened on April 19 then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the General @-@ General Pro@@ sec@@ utor of the Republic working out the application , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ b@@ aza to re @-@ establish his old post as the company did not complete a discipl@@ in@@ arity after his detention .
however , many citizens do not have the promotion well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to restore the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poses a back to fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ress with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the res@@ ignation .
however , the firm apparently fails and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Mos@@ aic social media , this behaviour also re@@ jects and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them eat .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and provide his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has cons@@ ented to become integrated into the company which he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director possessed no morality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that one is rewarded with someone in such a way that has already massi@@ vely offen@@ ded the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but it has only served its own country .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , when handmade money is an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself , this man has become tired , re@@ charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines , remembering that a th@@ ief is in prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mos@@ ambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp , lon@@ ged and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he was energetic , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he does not change the tactics but he does not turn away from his ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ sent@@ ing :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years old and came free .
and today he sets him the company , in which he de@@ prec@@ lu@@ des money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - An@@ cona ) . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means C@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ aged .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the web , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people with Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ash script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely con@@ notation con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is most commonly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts to the use of its use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same letter like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; is written what the same letters contains , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( crest ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ uses A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by doing a word .
the proposition ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ amping is the opinion that it will l@@ essen the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also pointed out that Facebook analy@@ tic must be analytical , before all Po@@ sts extingu@@ ishers which spread in suspicion , racism to spread .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( split ) .
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists who distribute hate speech , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to be circumc@@ ised its nationalism as well .
while the action may send a strong signal to all that may send hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of impact often becomes a cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are just starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I got to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post office to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and it was prohibited the lift , post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not dis@@ miss . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who don &apos;t have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on hate hate crimes more radically nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more on Facebook prior to the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asks for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but so it does not work .
to cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities .
moreover , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inher@@ sen@@ curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover , this would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automated cens@@ or@@ ship has taken care of a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook and are aware of the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts that were not contained in hate speech , but still removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

screen@@ shot , with permission used .
over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have also used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks will additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have brought thousands of escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to critic@@ ise the ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating hate hate on his bur@@ mes@@ i sites under control .
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context as on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the pedi@@ atri@@ ation .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pedi@@ atri@@ ation is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously on 9 June 2017 to ban the practice which this practice should for@@ bid , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ thood , some members of the Duma and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state cannot interfere with , as that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined by min@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical center of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that seek to a@@ vert laws on the inf@@ ancy , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hindu guide , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s toe , they should look forward to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made tensions in this really complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts if the opposition would not agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the pedi@@ atri@@ ation , despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make it a law .
now only the President of the country must approve and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again has :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill for pedi@@ atri@@ ation was determined by the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes to do so and no one on it .
after having decided prior to the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed to children &apos;s marriage .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was a minister in the Education Ministry , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk to pay the core of the thing , but do you know what ? children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now , and this is almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to put the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ ging News !
the Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the pan@@ try age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years .
the draft to change the German law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote .
all MEPs who were against , have voted for the law .
the marriage @-@ toe is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago for law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ ami@@ age@@ .
many thanks to all activists who have taken him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed and he seems to redeem his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the General@@ ate General Al @-@ wi , a prop@@ on@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj is acting against the law , the most social media users wish to address the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that the state , our daughters are protecting , that they might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are ab@@ used to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children may be legal in various gra@@ dations , or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they fail .

through the mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia contents
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was represented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ ting to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the US , internationally distributed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia .
day after day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the block@@ age .
although many techniques were used to use locker tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held regularly after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
in China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain blocked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ ate pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine @-@ computer connections ) , which does not depend on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of a legal prohibition .
in a Blog@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) we put everything to put sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also that this step independently was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it &apos;s just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has a mirror @-@ source of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to squ@@ ad similar mir@@ ror@@ ate sites if the country of Wikipedia is blocked .

it is not a complete copy of one proxy , a mirror .
one attack on another URL that is not the original one . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
basically , the server heads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves then when they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring back to the international stage at the age of 28 .
and his home town , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which draw attention to Nepal as a wildlife .
he described on Facebook as he helps him to help her work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate goat photographer ! !
I just rested from home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I went with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling images ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to acquire global recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as terri@@ bly as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing on coun@@ tenance from face to face :
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the poet appeared . he immediately sets up , we see ourselves and he started me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) in his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took until he could take photographs of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist destination .

this post was written by Kay@@ ati@@ az post @-@ swal@@ a and originally published on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was published once again as part of a Content @-@ Sharing Convention .
in many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even by older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm to receive this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a cord and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives .
the tradition of their wives also do not name in the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less per@@ missions to fear , if at all , they should not come out of this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and became quickly became the main conversation subject of the city .
it is a place just for them , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the breakdown of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was for seven years working with the help of her video camera to cover practices , such as children &apos;s homes to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ fied , and guides these clubs .
she reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in their discussion , showed the women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands on behalf of their spouses .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem which women can easily identify .
speaking out the name of her hus@@ bands is a bread@@ board , that she has kept all the obligations , and have never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is regarded as a sne@@ ak@@ y , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is deeply rooted in such a discussion that we have never made thoughts about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had previously never called her husband by name , try out at home as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time , after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started their first disc@@ ot@@ lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; never before . some felt that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round the Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
according to the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant in the name of her husband to say with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , meaning that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the bra@@ kes of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she kis@@ sed throughout the whole exercise , and another decided to let the whole an@@ gled frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ renalin rush over to have broken with an ancient fires , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she started star@@ ing , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation made in violence .
Roh@@ ini tells how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic @-@ red point on the forehead , which shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the galvan@@ ic point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to carrying him .
the other women have not ceased , but my , they are now in a better position to choose itself , not to carry it on some days .
for many women the Dis@@ cussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with each discussion of the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack a lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what could be &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things , such as our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have just worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted to carry out a sal@@ ine Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt about a pants , they don &apos;t drink .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes @-@ choice , morality combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mug@@ gled Cru@@ ini its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Upper inhibit@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will succeed .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion , I have already changed something , the Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have just taken small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and are not another family members involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ ers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the tick to make more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
every one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club each of us gives confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we talk about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of ab@@ duction of young people for the organ@@ ale , probably for super@@ visor , troubled the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they got that the organs of Sham@@ anas in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
it will give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man of man could bring gold or wealth , the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ prec@@ cher declared by Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered on gl@@ oss people in Mozambique .
another group that is intended for ob@@ scure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN led a mission in the South African country to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country , Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel into the land :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who travel to Mozambique war in Mozambique are the objective of ritu@@ alistic attack , warned the mos@@ aic police after the most recent days of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the rules took place .
Hus@@ ene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabitants of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ans in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are the case already following :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ oss of men .
the persecution and murder of lack@@ lu@@ gs individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ chur@@ ch@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , which also suggests that there existed a belief that existed in the head of the Republic of Mos@@ ambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also existed , according to the victims in the head , would have the riches to generate the riches .
in recent days three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ antha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , which indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique is facing :
I would like to be fond of E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ICH , in which the people would have ashamed to challenge sex against good notes , and others would not viol@@ ate sex , and others would not viol@@ ate their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or smoo@@ ther member for super@@ visor who aim to achieve a wealth of wealth .
despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humour were not to be missed .

Basel &apos;s stay and constitution were still unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , known as N@@ oura from Syrian officials killed that he was executed by 2015 .
today and in the future we prove to be a pioneer of the open Web @-@ movement as a pioneer of the open Web @-@ movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have employed for his release in the last five years .
since 2011 and the onset of protests against the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those who were arrested by the regime or disappeared , are torture and even exec@@ utions .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably was recently made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ si@@ ties Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having participated in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that was involved in the democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China is referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tells a spokes@@ man , he did it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
but a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should pressure pressure to allow Li@@ u to make a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a b@@ ang after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government was speaking , that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have only been res@@ umed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
once the message had been dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of its incar@@ cer@@ ation , he was not able to counter@@ act its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6th , the European Parliament adopted a vote in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest , and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also asked for the release of Li@@ us as well as for the release of Li@@ us on June 30 , 2012 :
at the same time , we expect China to take all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in this respect he is helping him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27th , announced that the message sent to Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the invitation from the US Embassy attracted an angry response from China to itself , with the exterior of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with an isolated and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple that :
protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to medical care of its choice based on Chinese constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go to proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on July 7th and 8th at the G20 , in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tices around Li@@ u could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by visiting Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um asked China to provide appropriate medical care and give it the opportunity to make sure of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer , AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside , including its lawyers , to talk and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um tells on :
Canada asks China to comply with its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , uph@@ old and release those rights for the exercise of these rights .
France in France
France &apos;s State Department requested China on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments he needs , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact to him .
although the news sender France has already reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome the country of Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information to see whether France will eventually record him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Foreign affairs in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance to those who require peaceful means to reform political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese law Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also asked China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed themselves very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been rigor@@ ously punished to a harmon@@ ic , stable and prosperous China , which in turn contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ s@@ am , Singapore was supposed to be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Law@@ yers of the State of New York , the Minister that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries .
he supportive that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ erio accused the judiciary , &quot; the logic to rot@@ ate &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable country , we can say that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , the country is it then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ am @-@ led reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries , in view of this , he appeared inevitably in@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the issue , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers to be the prevailing democrats , since they are better suited to their power .
in the final effect , the responses in the last week of Shan@@ mug@@ am were given answers to its American guests regarding our press , our Judi@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ replies .
corresponding questions tar@@ ded with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ am to make his opinion clear , as they did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ gling would take the effort to clear this point if it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
when An@@ on publishes his comment on the blog , he points toward critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire course of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he enjoys Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ am , which makes a leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrassed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de what was expecting me - if I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ s@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes that he is defending .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ places the weaknesses of Shan@@ s@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ s@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; credited a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ d@@ ger &apos;s speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country the sovereign rights of the city go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government of the government , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ s@@ mug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Lon@@ ans make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills back ?
what is the value of our pink human resources ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed a lot of Lon@@ urer ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices made short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your hometown or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is put to me most in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered a polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
on my mind then follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are maybe bo@@ il war@@ dly ahead of anger when they are held for Americans but don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
American on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - from Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there is no weapons with us !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is alleged to be considered the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
it would not account me if one would switch from Dallas to an example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be mirror @-@ like , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian doubles ) .
if Canada would really be a nation of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
being harmless , means to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you don &apos;t want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things around one .
I would even come so far , say that the desire to be free and alone , a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not talk often about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness , which I have now connecting with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ves Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video which took over the jun@@ ta , which took over the power of the Jun@@ ta , and despite their promise to re@@ establish the civil government , the country continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about which rules his girlfriend makes his girlfriend .
although not explicitly politically , the Music video refers directly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
within the first three days the video loaded on Facebook 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times was shared and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month even Charlie Chap@@ lin &apos;s video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to look at this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policies , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
check out these recordings from the video to see some of the political issues discussed in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ in section 44 of the preliminary constitution which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality whose v@@ ague and in@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities for activ@@ ist activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitors the online content and individuals who are accused of having sl@@ ander@@ ed the monarchy .
Thailand uses a stri@@ c against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( majest@@ y ins@@ ul@@ ting ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was launched in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is their decision to buy expensive underground boats , although security experts warned they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax exemp@@ tions .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car , before taking them into an interval camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison because they allegedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened for long pen@@ alties , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed the band members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was already used by coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the protests of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
life continues on the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in the eastern Ab@@ ch@@ Asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society develops only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ian war has officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the deserted villages of the northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chi@@ ava are in the carbon@@ ic basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , shut@@ downs , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians and waste in the area are living in the area .
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ cians in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there still lived more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the 16@@ ,000 people amoun@@ ted to over a decade after over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty fif@@ teenth @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ g@@ love @-@ kas are symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it strikes him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , who served all of the community .
now , there is only paved road with feder@@ ate splend@@ or buildings .
the people who were once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas , which are still one or two families , you can recognize the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discover me with the camera in his hand , she immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother is forbidden to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden it , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence economy ( cultivation of scenic products for equity ) such as cattle @-@ breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial help from her daughter and insist that she is supporting her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do so constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything . &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ viewer Nat@@ asch@@ a has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remember the thorn before the war .
despite the relatives , which live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ ol in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to build a house there , but that will take a bit , &quot; it explains them .
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives about $ 9 children for each child .
your man works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asha kinder@@ garten once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her change .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it was more likely to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our talk goes to the end , a little boy stri@@ ves to pass by .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball , who then rolls up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the outdated buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it any other way .

in Mexico home &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses immigrants on its long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink e@@ ll@@ en@@ gest@@ ell and gold @-@ tone ear @-@ rings in te@@ ddy @-@ bears form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact trained that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
for about $ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full small buses and the upper part of the coast begin to call it : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept out on Kart@@ ons .
it does not want to decline anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mas@@ king them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is recently arrived .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who studied a yo@@ ghurt ) with Con@@ cep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take normally a first stop in South America and then move toward the north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ aner and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the track and that the Afri@@ cans speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and has worked as construction workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
as the Brazilian economy , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been guest in Mama Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send their often text messages , when they have gone to gr@@ assy or to report their about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests are taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling by Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has determined that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are to be sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly shar@@ ks .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to win money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single out , has offered him their roof .
some months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests .
in the courses the travellers call themselves quietly their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
as a proud Grand@@ mother feed her in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a cli@@ ent@@ in , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travelers more , boy and old .
they laugh sad while they put them briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeatedly repeated it every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users to be able to di@@ gest .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile notification of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi . a mobile notification , in which it indicates the District government , to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ Ã²@@ n@@ ated the authorities use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , having been replaced with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists , together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphy web sites , from online fraud , tro@@ users and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course an app with these features can naturally be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers allow to manipulate the home network of one person or ste@@ al it from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , pressing ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ down .
the media @-@ based media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( be used to di@@ gest things ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , at which polic@@ emen the residents were in@@ calcul@@ able as if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification called that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .

the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and with the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi . a regulation with the instruction to all the residents and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disk , not@@ ebooks and media storage . &quot;
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action ent@@ ails the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible failures , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and stell@@ st that you are alone on a place where everything is right .
everything has gradually been dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible , both from the inside and outside .
one that makes their name all glory .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions , which does not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scen@@ er and the performer - turn out the characters in beings of flesh and blood , and all cry for death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone to build stone .
they have taken me and my father three times , but that was not yet enough for me to make my lecture , &quot; as the head of the security service it formed - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he put his power over us by proving even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn away from a peaceful protests and wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it reached out to allow the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; all @-@ ahu &apos; scre@@ am .
all the city district sought after , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rain , at the wrong time , even though I did not set high demands to a town that has put into the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ med after the power supply to work in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence by crying several times &quot; all@@ ahu &apos; of my house @-@ house .
I heard my voice res@@ ided by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we agreed to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully .
in such a moment you become aware that you are interested in the spirit from the lamp , but it is not interested in the most part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned : no matter how much honey you can sit down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear the way you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes were looking forward to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you mour@@ n really what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I believe I have never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in detail and his father equally with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this adul@@ ter@@ ated proposition lies to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture , which I was exposed to months .
I scre@@ ams the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office which leads through a hallway to the single cells .
I pre@@ ach all the details exactly before I did the room .
otherwise they probably have given me a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoners and can put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I reached a well @-@ established communication method : with the fist to beat the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ y was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ hearted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells lay a respectable man middle age , similar to me and called &quot; doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there can be no distinctive feature to me , and doctors are not here : we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers heard about its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had ass@@ ures me , they would fre@@ t him if I abide .
li@@ ar .
would I have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ban@@ ish all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from a distance I still hear it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the cry , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black saw the color of spo@@ iling , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
this means that the secret was made : to protect the state of security against us , and prevent the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ board and dis@@ car@@ ded the narrow eye field of her world view .
this is not a house that is here no country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I called the hearing , and tre@@ mb@@ ling on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , which he ent@@ ail , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than you can join this diary and protest against demonstrations that are soon to find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to answer it , not to answer .
I can really no longer tell exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I probably had to get used to it , punished , although I had not done anything to make this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to give me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is called the loving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confes@@ sion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your head@@ sman rejo@@ iced in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cry was not yet enough , why they ex@@ ed the re@@ ed by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a trash collection , or if this belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables mixed up with each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within one hour , three of them are rare , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense of my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and didn &apos;t find any favour , which is why he served as a neighbour on an electri@@ fied st@@ ab .
electricity perme@@ ates my entire body , enough to supply my whole quarter .
my semi @-@ sha@@ ky body , the out@@ stretched on the floor was the perfect power ladder .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been at midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , that occurred to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the brightness meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive young : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and be@@ away you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where are they leading me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + Community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the bulk of his time inside . sometimes he lo@@ dges to his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which was heard in 1967 ; the year , in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as rocky ( approximately : Far@@ mer ) .
for the past six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces conservative majority and asks their old @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ h music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world , but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find relevance in his hometown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as a person who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and according to his own statement with the people , he can suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though it is not open to the US foreign policy , he calls for a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed of the second generation &quot; - he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that I am a man , while he sh@@ ook into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is envis@@ aged for Muslims from dawn to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking up with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot jun@@ k has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the sle@@ eves are talking about hot coffee and the sw@@ aths of the K@@ ent cig@@ ar in the nose first place of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries .
so it is avo@@ ids to do basic things - to drink fundamental things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an water - to land not in jail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has said a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians , who support the Islamic Action front - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradic@@ ts and the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former prestige of the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was said &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also affir@@ m the commitment of the band in matters like Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that poses the old proven legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la embr@@ aced the j@@ ord@@ al people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be easy for rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan reflect the appearance in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to Lei@@ be by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly de@@ hydr@@ ated unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in Jordan the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 reached their peak ; however , he added that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence to provide adequate way .
according to a law to collapse control from 1954 , women who are exposed to in@@ tra @-@ friendly violence , &quot; at un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expense as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , also do not shy away from themes which in his country long as tab@@ oo .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , adm@@ its that he is his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was drawn into politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words , &quot; what one wants &quot; - be it faith or not belief , He@@ tero@@ - or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were heavily cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ al Online@@ Program Ro@@ ya , to be noted later that his comments from the context were swe@@ pt , and in his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but there was only a working version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b acquire H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ something , a po@@ ets of the eighth century , which still has remained in memory today due to its homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ bre later , in the eighth century openly about homo@@ sexuality could write , why the Jord@@ an@@ ier could not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tish kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
even recently , in January 2017 , the schol@@ astic news service took several former governmental members and members of the apprentic@@ eship , with the reason they had expressed criticism in social media with critical issues that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs indicate only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him progress is a constant place to give and taking . Jordan has dri@@ lled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , depres@@ sions and internal changes . he is sure that these changes are happening day by day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an Society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he dreams not only of it , to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , streams and artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to over@@ lap and thus also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ bs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory implies that the fes@@ tivities , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been over@@ thrown over a thousand years , in the armies of Japan in the North @-@ East mar@@ ched to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a super view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two forti@@ fications are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high feast was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate occupation like the Fris@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s major harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road noise and illegal drugs are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can produce these elaborate hair styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers of your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show who can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks on them as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who find themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to enter their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice for training in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ et@@ ting possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops in front of the school year in March and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the municipality and district , which we are very proud , because from love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ illa
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ rilla struggles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why are we just writing love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel irrit@@ ating , affection ?
precisely this question went by the two young Colombian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Youth Foundation &apos;s campaign and inspired her to the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) to write letters by men .
only recently was their land show@@ room of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , forming the longest point of armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered to be the signing of the peace contract as such that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
however , before the colum@@ bi@@ ans , there is still a long way to come from real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ ors who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out their arms around the clock and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colombian society again , who had become accustomed to life in fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , this must now take in their ranks and assist them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ rilla struggles to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla warfare - which should be passed personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those forgot they need much more unnecessary .
he plane , he continued to share his love with people this year , the most urgent .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colombian company is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
in the framework of the Camp@@ a@@ ign more than 2000 letters have been collected .
the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombian such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and BogotÃ¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists in the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC stood up as they had previously done to increase the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of shelter from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; the Political Sciences Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ rilla struggles live ) I saw a guer@@ rilla shock , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because besides him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ p@@ light , a deadly weapon in the thorn of the thorn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and yet I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answered that . &quot; I suddenly walked the tears of the che@@ eks .
I changed it completely and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ades .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know , that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the op@@ ener came students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this order , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
these people hear who have never heard hearing before and had no voting right now , and to realize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings who were turned through their circumstances and their environment was quite painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , can bring us something together and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s , the Archbishop of the town Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ b@@ ans was prophes@@ ied , that after the escape , peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as there are inequality , famine and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack arms and protest to their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those under us who defend life as the basis of existence will be ahead of many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ c@@ asian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of pregnant men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ome on the dor@@ f@@ LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not just about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international headlines after reports published after reports published the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who susp@@ ects que@@ er men and took them in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun barrels .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she became grown , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chn@@ ya had experienced their country@@ men , the hunt has been opened on Sabrina .
they came out of fear for their lives in the end of the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
it was a famili@@ arity from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who hid in trouble .
she had no money , so I did without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he disappeared her to his ch@@ ad@@ hen@@ ish friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents took the lap through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was talking about a few shopping chairs , from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ el the family , you Sch@@ and@@ y ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up again in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I experienced that I had two f@@ aded in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals have you been laid - in the men or women of the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there &apos;s my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has moved respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , stranger , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was attended by neighbours and a few remote relatives .
the slow@@ ed to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya , to prove that all that was a lie .
they made absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it by going up without through the streets ; others wanted me to be in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have KÃ¶r@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the streets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a kn@@ ack around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and saved them came .
at the moment I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and already few hours later stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a h@@ ash shield with a 95 file .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little lazy .
my human right friends tested the Num@@ eric depic@@ tion - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I do not want to disclose their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something dis@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived .
I bought them without having to register without any identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
in that moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you would be sure , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ak . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you still contact your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ oo topic .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements I always carry in me .
so I would like to have this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble as to look at the person they remember from their past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I made a report to Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has saved a and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ramad@@ an no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t shut up a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
in order for me , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has obtained through blood Gen@@ ug@@ ging .
OC Media : are there even more co@@ il men held in this secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would be no many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or were left out of their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they are recorded there , so that they can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be converted , you will show their bodies on TV and pret@@ end they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
understand you ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not just van@@ ished , they were targeted , in order to be radical . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained in Ar@@ gun half a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there was nothing new from them since .
they simply have them taken .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was with himself when these people were taken .
until now , they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who heard a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I always carried my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 I was already well known in Gros@@ ny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was true , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civilian ter@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally he was thrown back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were stu@@ ffed ; I had colored lashes , carried out RÃ¶@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the Security Ministry of Sch@@ aria never only has a hair tri@@ mm@@ ed for me .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t have the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if those are funny about sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed to the Prime Minister , he began speaking about morality in television .
he did not speak about us , but priority over the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change .
he who had ch@@ ained and denied them , regarded you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly swal@@ lowed .
OC Media : what activity do you do now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , meeting , I buried them to hospital and helping them to get Essen@@ tial types .
I have no di@@ ents for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ ashed a curse .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry out a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is silly .
so is nature that has nothing to do with religion at all .
that is exactly the same as Che@@ chn@@ ya , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there is no gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dag@@ est@@ ans have who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have Russians which ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear .
here , I meet so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and fa@@ sten during Ramad@@ an - live with men .
do you know many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a Tru@@ g@@ um .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be exact , different lifestyles .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be in person here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of self @-@ murder within the Arab @-@ Nazi regime in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty reduction within the local Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last months there has been a strong rise of self @-@ murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay in@@ capacity to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video posted on YouTube held the moments after he pl@@ under@@ ed himself .
some people get it fast to clear the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists locally warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - sublime .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family father@@ ed who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ able because of the persecution of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of Iran living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , making it difficult to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly self @-@ autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to stop the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most striking and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly and the local population gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically workplaces in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ s built , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are to be reloc@@ ated .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness and devast@@ ation , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi youth rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for Co @-@ operation , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have concluded a job that finished elementary school , 55 % a leading school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken@@ im@@ i said that particularly unemployment has recently become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z emerging ethnic Per@@ sians and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the imagination process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Fun@@ c@@ tion@@ aries and institutions prefer not to susp@@ end the Arab labour force , the local Arab An@@ w@@ azi will be deprived of access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and to be considered , as even Arab names are not tolerated by the workplace , consecr@@ ated the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , hit human rights defen@@ ders alarm , before being able to explo@@ its .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identifying with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional character &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ an@@ las@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay out well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should all femin@@ ist .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a smoo@@ ther blan@@ ket sooner or later in various fields of life , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I &apos;m suffering twice and three times .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to talk on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LG@@ BT@@ IQ community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I chose to have been ab@@ used in racism , mentally and verbal , both in and outside the feminist movement , mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos;s &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form of racial or racial violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and home cities make less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school are referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights , all the men and all the people of any skin . on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , which ref@@ uses to take into account both the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affili@@ ation in an white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which black woman in historical respects is a human and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings that are also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to drive her ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women to explain the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to be the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them of a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different her@@ nia , and cut off from white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to dissoci@@ ate myself fully from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than ins@@ istent me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ality as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is more important than ever before that black women define ourselves according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the sphere that will be created by us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ass@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ans : recru@@ iting ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaking of our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned .
in an wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I existed .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as a part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected .
pad@@ ling against the pollution : the man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine dedicated to international efforts towards solving environmental problems .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published once again .
over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Iraqi Kurdistan region . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers in the region and the impact of pollution on its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , the pollution , and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation of Water@@ man Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a contains the urgency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , produced in Iraq and multimedia journals , filmed , filmed and edited .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with whose help sup@@ pressed communities who can tell their stories their stories .
Paraguay ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo from Jes@@ sie In@@ fr@@ an PÃ©@@ rez . use with friendly permission .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ oni . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # gra@@ y@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bus@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had grown up against violent .
since the end of its relationship there was some time passed and the police told her statement would be put into the acts , but more could not do .
as another woman can@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , the ak@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women change at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men that abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that does not under@@ pi@@ ous 3 of Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really bl@@ ended , My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Doc@@ ument@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , but not even to explain the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the figures available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District State Building 9@@ 600 ads came to domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads in police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace process . here , 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically challenged , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Frauen@@ minister@@ ing Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman who will be re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
on every woman who re@@ funded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated they at the end of 2014 .
since the su@@ icide in Paraguay is not an own crime , the enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she did not want that , but after all , she was supposed to regret it forever .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer working with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , most recognizable :
I never thought I would have been a victim of failure .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are happening that are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they dec@@ eive themselves from violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described their ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people answered their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to conce@@ de that his behaviour was also a form of failure .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain co @-@ blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was fighting them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic failure .
your wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads in the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive support .
it carried out a process against its former partner who developed into an im@@ penetr@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was primarily about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees also great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ am@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ saving ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law can be seen , fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent offen@@ se , and to pun@@ ish , as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in a number of points in order to also urge members of the law to p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay up to five years in prison .
the original draft law was envis@@ aged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) charges , which have to bear the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply want to refund display and receive a safe accommodation to abandon the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective unless the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources to it :
in Paraguay Mis@@ sions is seen as part of a human relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer viewed as something Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes in light of these facts is guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of offen@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to refund such a long ad until abuse is no longer regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law were changed , however , one passage was painted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about changes will go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor his victim to attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the strike of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great response . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and modified version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ oni . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # gra@@ y@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reports on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
independent media in Oman a year after the prohibition of a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this site was locked to read on the website of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homepage on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting about corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he was sentenced to a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but came again later .
Oman is governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster command@@ ing , the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Minister , Secretary of State of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is characterised by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , to restrict and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematic and citizen citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n Zeitung , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its inception in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , firmly established after the newspaper on 26 July 2016 was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a sentence in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper from 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of editorial committee , was charged from the ISS to the Special department and arrested upon his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy chief editor at You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acts after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the Defence Minister gave the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison chap@@ els and orda@@ ined the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both judged among other things due to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; misuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ jug@@ ation of the Pres@@ entation of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public ban and sl@@ ander@@ ing for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic reefs ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a sentence of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after using &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to the public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was set up in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the sentence of his six month imprisonment . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he was sentenced to his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Defence , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper considers itself to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anische government .
on January 8 , the Defence Minister sent a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Defence Minister personally signed a further instruction , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus the Minister presented another time against the decision of the appeal to permit the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspapers are not the only cases in which in Oman at the most recent times the press freedom has been violated .
further violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to adjust its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists are able to follow their work ;
3 . press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman their right@@ ful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including in court proceedings , can exercise .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in the surrounding States through the promotion of opinion and association freedom , as well as the right to gather peacefully and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
for the need on site medical research , there are two reasons : for a lacking in the supply of global health , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have widespread impact in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists by establishing its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Committee on the Centre for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored the HIV virus , before he decided to go home to support the SÃ¡@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the effective national program for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
GV : what do you think are the important current themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only deal with solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being creators .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they focus , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ agi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa toward western countries , based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and ag@@ grav@@ ating access to scientific expertise that are facing challenges here .
the system that magazines make items accessible only against payment ( so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , are also limited to the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers will change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports opportunities for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been instrumental in the United States for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronom@@ ers in space and consumed .
for nearly 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only set by its own resour@@ ce@@ fulness and the question of how many sal@@ ads can get borders .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use it further to breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a specific red or green tone or scrat@@ ched leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . because of these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert safety provide food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of the old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , he needs no longer need for it , since his work is increasingly complicated by ever more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as if there &apos;s a rock of rock in a river that I have to bl@@ unt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents on sal@@ ads are too far away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand on trial , no one can breed any more of a new balance of salt because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; so he makes it as good as possible and tried to try out those characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ored to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he is also connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bree@@ der ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International spac@@ er ISS have bred red tubes in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the station and eaten . there , it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : NASA
it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US @-@ breeders can agree that others can freely use the seeds from them .
however , this does not mean that they can do business with their seeds , and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; -@@ breeders allow others to breed their seeds to breed so own , and it is not immediately out@@ going - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection .
seeds therefore plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by stimulating seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants might be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer are to be announced on the ever more prevalent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , as for example on peasant markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
nutritional sovereignty without seed @-@ making is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dges to share others with their seeds , so that their approach is as opposed to pat@@ ting seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered , since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming more reduced , neg@@ lig@@ ently shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has been engaged in her doc@@ torate with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ els were protected as intellectual property , making it available to plant breeders either at all or only available .
for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ based plants such as wheat are patented in a bigger style as a salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted features - from those who have improved their taste or colour to such a due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders increasingly decreases more patents . genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predictable .
in an email , Monsanto @-@ spokes@@ woman in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company focuses on the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellectual property &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ates other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant variation innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method to get the same result .
such protection thus inhi@@ bits innovation not , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees that differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , there certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es in the concept of pat@@ chy , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not create the characteristics really itself .
the plants make them themselves out and as breeders have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si pre@@ ten@@ ders , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who has ch@@ ained a kind of kind , and has its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation of mass@@ acres , pul@@ ls in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly gent@@ l@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than B. Monsanto are patents ) , it creates the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bree@@ der by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ rons of innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors sell my varieties in a couple of years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy to do with my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is growing rapidly around the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to get on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , because of the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply become one one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent system that allows patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of plant breeders and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patent of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently preparing a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems for the next year of the official start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity globally in order to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a network of aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report . in this , they believe that farmers have the opportunity to engage in seeds , to exchange and improve seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si that will soon see him more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to clarify the people that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the newest objectives of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still susp@@ end the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend round the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government reported the site of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on sel@@ f@@ using .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Network for Human Rights Information remain ab@@ re@@ - despite this attack and understanding of the Egyptian &apos;s Law and the Constitution . even though it was never so difficult to un@@ cover these goals , so it was never so important to pursue these goals in this part of the world , so it was never so important to overcome these objectives . we insist that we will continue to fulfill our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , following more than two months ago , the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the derived network of Al Jazeera due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI also there is no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights research scientist Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he writes in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he was involved in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blog@@ gers , the provider of which also native to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported by Egyptian security guards while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercise physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada led to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs are very old , however , has been a priority in the era of ab@@ del@@ ici@@ als al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the block@@ age of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It was able to give me the feeling of an ins@@ ult to convey ; An poison@@ ing , a try murder , pres@@ cri@@ es at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site , for whom I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ y and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 sites . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors that was possible through the byp@@ assing of inter@@ net@@ en@@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s , began .
such practice points to the intention of the government to further block content and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed that the cens@@ ors are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with the action to act against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day by day newspapers in all Brazil with sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ es headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Every@@ one &apos;s second day is assass@@ inated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ b ro@@ bes pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the force in Rio has reached the highest stand for 10 years .
the Brazilian government organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so released for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ fs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . all that happens by the civili@@ zed standard and what only in Rio has been published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to allow us to close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not even recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that there is a war of war , if he is dist@@ orts , also to cover the atrocities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
should the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil ar@@ gues the Journ@@ al@@ ist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra in contrast to call the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibilities in police accountable .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - like Extra in the analysis of the military responses in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and com@@ plac@@ ent neglect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we view the murder rates per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which stresses like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , repeatedly repe@@ ats the security policy of the state .
these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and to use unity permanently there .
in the beginning this actually resulted in a withdrawal of violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect from several reports on Shi@@ ps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor con@@ gregations that should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under publication .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux reported from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to use ways and ways which are typical for a war . in addition , penetration in the territory of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and is an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collagen damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irrit@@ ating damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war round or forth , fact is that the residents of fav@@ elas still suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police cla@@ p up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
in the midst of all this violence also this incident took place : a fruit distributor died as a result of shots that had escaped the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loy@@ alist forces .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syrians in a state of sie@@ ge .
in particular , the region of the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21st 2013 called for hundreds of thousands of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition depend on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acres of the Assad regime has been practi@@ sed .
since 2013 , the rebels have been controlled by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus , which led them to be dependent on murder@@ ers or through tunnels and control points .
the lon@@ gl@@ ade block@@ ade are traditional foods such as meat un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure a group of Syrian humanitarian bodies and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of the East G@@ hou@@ tas teaches how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fungi do not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their dietary supplement makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of fungi , because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fought for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 family knowledge to planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is reli@@ ant on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to fuel scar@@ city , local ingredients are used for plastic , in order to supply generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began using the &quot; production from the regions of fungus , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable to consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lec@@ turer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed for free anywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want people to teach the mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ supply , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and sie@@ ge is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of District cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that are r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured due to forest fires , 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of states .
fires also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts that spread out in the northern and centrally located regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system that monitors the forest areas via satellite images , 2017 in Portugal are about 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some of Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread over the net and show images that allow better insights into the event :
the un@@ predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tiv@@ ation and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked themselves why civil protection was unable to intervene as far as possible to the extent of the tragedy .
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are endless reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy might have been happening in June as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction @-@ permits are stored in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ alities with a high fire risk .
a far @-@ breaking proposal for the whale @-@ form , which the government brought down in 2003 and 2005 , was made up by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the applicant over funds to self protection - that was an open but@@ t door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val goes on in the same article on the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly combus@@ tible wood , itself , as in a vi@@ cious circle , gradually spread further down this species .
in addition to these problems , the web site of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants were looking for information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to life to simplify the work of fire brig@@ ade and was conducted at this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who kept the fires , not ste@@ amed the site over half a million hits .

in one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years previously , a terrible civil war had been defeated between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had conquered the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan was turned into a land of terror and despair .
right at this time , A@@ vel@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the G@@ haz@@ ni Province for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party , b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ date had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban for their hate on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape A@@ vel@@ af found itself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coal pit . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wages and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ar who were heavier than he himself , to earn his livel@@ ih@@ oods .
at that time as today , the life of African refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we checked n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we fail at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous ascent on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and pl@@ ough@@ ed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ vel@@ af 2002 returned to Italy .
some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal for assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , but it is true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are disastrous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Civil Rights Organisation Civil Rights Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers is accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this is the impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ tive staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they officially asked a request for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum &apos;s month .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it is also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ stable life @-@ en@@ clos@@ ers helped A@@ vel@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after he had done various working in the construction industry for several years , Ash@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ lim@@ bic bite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;

plenty of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan &apos;s company founders , including cutting plants , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have been created .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience to which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ per targets are however far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ ic sector and the retail sector and aim back to the land which he had to leave am@@ o@@ ids as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says ath@@ she@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same ways as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislative cards from Egypt make shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody .
he reported on the clear@@ ance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices of Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global interactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ee that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after winning the authority of the authority under stating their full name as well as their identity code . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment , or the end of a criminal trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was advertised by six parliament@@ arians , is currently in legislative as well as the constitutional committee of parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May another deputy was given a stat@@ ute in which tougher pen@@ alties would be introduced to the ins@@ ult of the President or of a high officials .
among Egyptian justice , the for@@ estation of the President and the government institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the legislative attack , such an act would however be punished with jail and fin@@ es , so right of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be adopted , this can hold up to three years imprisonment for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judgment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a distinctive example is case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) which was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he illustrated Egyptian polic@@ emen who demonstrated violence against demonstrators opposed to the military coup , who led to the prime minister of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail on a comp@@ ense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison management was failed to bring the def@@ endants in the cour@@ tro@@ om ) according to human rights groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree to cover head@@ set of other weapons @-@ ownership , illegal assembly , murder and experim@@ entation .
in another case , a criminal court spoke in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ ar@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activists to trans@@ duc@@ ted documents
in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media @-@ platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices of Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly devoted to a de@@ str@@ ated action plan . bes@@ tos plan was specifically supported by the President of the Republic , which would explicitly provide regulatory draft law by dict@@ ator by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused Am@@ nesty Am@@ nesty , provided that all un@@ lawful preserv@@ ative funds back .
the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the legislative situation look .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the separation of his sources under stating from Article 11 of the Tunisian press , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness .
will China force users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new provisions of the Security Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
the provisions will also indicate that registration with the full name will be required .
analy@@ st suspect that this is to be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese net citizens have suggested in the social media , these regulations are merely selective in order to protect the citizen journalism and its independence .
see you then in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia open access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat to register in the national government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the information proliferation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organise a list of online services , which gives the &quot; publication of the information , &quot; the law allows the government to take responsibility for removing content and comp@@ el it upon request for the suspension of user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Pl@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and other services .
Turkish dish is blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as

the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime matters and communication have been locked , the site had been blocked because it is about &quot; a source of information that works together with groups to make a policy diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey &apos;s website fully blocked . it is , among other things , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
