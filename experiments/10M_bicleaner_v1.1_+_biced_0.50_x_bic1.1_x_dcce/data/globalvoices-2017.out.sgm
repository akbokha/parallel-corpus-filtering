<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I have grown up with American movies I danced to American music, American authors have read and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me, that I was mainly journalist because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnates who had his interest to be inclined to occupy.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after method Man, "I was, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, it is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you are always that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, how he walks with his mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops his opinion behind the mountain as you says so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afrodents and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won at the Republican election was the highest number, who ever reached a candidate from the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like for instance my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, the people from all over the world, was a deep-growing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, trumps worldview does not agree with the members of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sus" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Inintolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She adapts to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied values deep my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While tracting his way to the nominee Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for pumping because they either share his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the tracump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an incapacity to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most knows, have voted for Trump because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down differently with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(1.): as much as" "" "rest of the White against all other ethnicities" "" "words from white in attacks on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as sheds light), as the great Van Jones called, exactly what America did so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one may always have, America is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For that land elected as its president, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to Hell with manifold, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation of Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a voke "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "discontinued the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answering them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vote and speaker-strong "NEIN."</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words, "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Commons Instruments" from Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Music bande) has now been playing in the community: one of children and adults of the existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and bonds.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You get ever lachingly and with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Pauhorn, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero children play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with revived instruments, made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura, where the recycling, under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez, have begun to turn parts of the case into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violets, violins, celli, bass bass, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones, trombones, trombones and percussion, all made from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classic music, folk music, paraguette and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local economist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the start time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the children worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio has been shown something he had never seen before: one out of waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from resumed material and which is called The Commons Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws up the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspirational spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music in front of the Pope Francis.</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work effectively fight for illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that battles the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already been operated in libreanic waters of illegal fishing, before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were corresponded accordingly and less inclined to welcome a lobrewing of this type on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles are mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their harbors and refused to give him a fishing effort.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan Fisheries authority. he is part of a team that was discovered and followed by the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately it was compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering of the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and safeguards, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop) was established.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"thus, we have eight countries that are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other where there is illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trust project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, absent for it extremely difficult to divide. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the intentional disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fisheries once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions occur today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, updates on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a period of port.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspects travel routes - such as such that a ship invites his captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fisherman license, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a penal ister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse to refuse such ships in their ports. what means that ships can not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to attract more than 20 million USD on lost sales, who lose the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to the illegal fishermen who enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To their practices include promotions as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit roypapers, indication of phantasy, the fishings protected species and fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeted on the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-boundless control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could be illegally represented and a country could say" "" "You daring my port to run" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and precisely this legal gorghole tried to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has criminal networks exposed to distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted and found ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances and preserved.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our examinations lead us pretty much into the networks organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspicious vessels to spot more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, also helps to divide the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and this we try to cross through," says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Marine Reserve Oceana platform that offers platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite channels and by which the position can be displayed on each veritable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources to examine." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trust has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only criminal, but they are also deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used sooner without license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have meanwhile had a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Greko 1 found, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these achievements." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries" "", "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa tens of hundreds of millions of dollars disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called" "" "West Africa Task Force." "" "there is certainly more illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the goal of leaving more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "", "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could report his first great triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the move under false flag. and not only was the ship even without a license and were used under towing networks, which now is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still penetrated into bottomed waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 found a strong sign that it goes against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a particular, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="197">This is an adapated version of a interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was released on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now as an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba to his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the BÃ¼rde, the same names as his father contribute to the brutal military perations in the prison La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of his secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturers and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmeriece. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was deputy commander of the secret services 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who spoke before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionists army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers' party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">In addition, you need two important skills: passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of native language. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Such a French native speakers, for example, translate the English language - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue that could produce translations into English. this may be lacking in lack of understanding for oversight, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees, make translations of their own business internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose Englishman are considered to be the best - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbs and puzzling phrases which are created by machine translation, show that this technique can not substitute for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the most strangely English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints which often uses T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money overgives her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange receives the child food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to do so countless days of housework, which can never be paid and sacrifice abuse and abuse - and all that can't be uplift up in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so, she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - gathered testimonies-telling, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, as the feeling of Gratitude, which is vaccinated to the criaditas, guarantees in general breastfeeding.</seg>

<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira suggested as long as having a stick on MarÃ­n, until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>

<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and started to sell on the street or on the market place to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, they had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example cleanse the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and desinfied the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner they had done with learning, the more leisure had it.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had never had dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says it never had to starve, but I didn't get an unlimited meal. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroediner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings of the householder Alvarenga, to stand beside him and to read editorial from Oppositionings such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="471">He kept them for intelligent, but remained not with her. "the housekeeper had found someone who listened to, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>

<seg id="474">But you were completely clear that they had paid for everything they had paid from them, with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken, harassment and the rails to which criaditas are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anyone to my home. I had no friendships at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in time where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of it.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the progress made for the northeast Japan has been made in the last six years to re-establish the life of those who were affected by the "Trinity disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a Tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. the prefecture of Miyagi was a etfect prefectures in Japan northeast, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring stovary of Fukushima and Iwata were evacuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, the Fukushima prefecture of the Fukushima prefecture, already alone had to leave 160 000 inhabitants left their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Report by Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been reached after six years to re-establish the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of the affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (the scube, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi has seen the biggest success among the three prefectures of Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">"" "" "" "Iwata has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima is with 70 percent the final light." ""</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, one is still striving for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of accommodation shelters (to be used, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwata lived in such expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of 2011 evacuation from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated, which after the disaster in expeditions, were moved to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwata the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday work in the three affected prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the disaster, have opened their doors to December 2016, which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the Fisheries in Iwata and Miyagi have now been put into operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishing vessels have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have moved in the three prefectures of agrarian-land-extensively in compassion.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwata and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural lands of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear wave zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures of Prefecture, tourism has recovered further again, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwata are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it feels more difficult to earn their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper resulted in numerous surveys among the native population and under the evacuated by. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how their receptivity has changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more beyond the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate the Fukushima Prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the position of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima did not only need to experience the tremendous earthquake and the devastating unami, no, the Fukushima prefecture of disaster was also a witness of the worst, disaster disaster, nuclear accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, had been settled in permanent spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">At the booth of 2017, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima are still living outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophs, most of the evacuated areas are still in expeditions, older than 50 years old. they have to compete in proper accommodation projects. this is the projects that compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwata and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a press channel from GoiÃ¢nia, divided the video via Luiz da Luz, divided the video on the net in which you see how Mateus is attacked by the police officers, and several sanctions briefly on it to him.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugars.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the decline, the sugar raw materials in the region lay still, and the factory lost gradually after its installations, until only the rumours of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some of them rarely change the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls that in MaÃ±alI would receive the sugars factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugars industry have already contradicted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, the inefficiencies, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvest have already been no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar factory turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway line of the church saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar consumption industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar hragans were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the rise rise in the world market.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada deal with issues that are important to them. they do this through Hip Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour has been launching mobile Tonstudios directly to schools and youth centers, in order to bring youth-groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will thus rise to the young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self acceptance," or whatever comes in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo is told in the territory of the tribe of the kitum - First Nation in British Columbia, also called "Highway" tears, "a road section in Westkanada on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous tongues, although the young people had not always mastered the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation received, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop Group, who gave them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan stands at the Strophe in Umbrella, as well as a translation into English, translated here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever would be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day where you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that one day we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">How can they grow and proceed as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they determined the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are near to the entrance shokuhin saniu (meaning of the scube that the plastic models of the dishes ") were issued by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small companies that make up those plastic dishes, which the German filmmakers Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese people, these plastic dishes usually are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is transformed today in showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos, which this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanju show.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic lacquered mobile phones, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy gathering, as in this case, cooling cabinet magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shoebox cooling cabinet magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essential Arts is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone-handed.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch as an apple, with a candle for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight expedition.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile-phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are also used, a popular plate, which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there any one who would say," "" "wow, cool, now I can put my mobile phone with laughter-oestrogen?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I believe I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetizing form to be surprised for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of meltdown ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wraps from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skurrile plastic hairs you can view at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # to the tip of the characters.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensory journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with images that can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only, which is disgusted or sad. it acts like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they mocks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere numbers are in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of men is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are therefore justified that they were "reeds."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to intervene that they remain spared by such tragedies when they are not and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "four months extortion in the main city district:" as a family has been looted like a family with threats, "it describes how armed criminal month for month money from their business, until they had destroyed not only the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">Pain should never pass, the trauma remains, the fear will come back high if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included their report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to cries. I must learn how to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the post" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence called" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents worry about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk pulverine.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are unimportant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw, which was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw this:</seg>
<seg id="810">In 2006 Bryan was born as a crime by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">JuÃ¡rez, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez has been the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings for public security and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Public Prosecutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morning per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that are leaving organised crime in Mexico and invade into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Very few stories live on the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 created the data journalistic project of Narcodata, whose goal has been tortured the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking which has tortured the country in the past four decades, in intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows shortened body that are ranked on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was noted several times in social media, blogs and other platforms, but not related to the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>

<seg id="838">Eye-witnesses reported dramatically of atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpse plagues around streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count corpses," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were cracked, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army-point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt at Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image emerged from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, when it was misunderstood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacres of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this miscible use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures; Africa Check has documented concessions on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a testament to massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">A step further bring personal comments like this example, understandably the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange joined in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a review, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee wounds, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by the violence against the Rohingya, Posts, like the following on, brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a saudi-Arab news page, which reported 2012, asserted that President Myanmars Thein Sein said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to address this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful themes or frames (framing) that draw these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of greater discussion on the silence of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the worshipments of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second frame uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers cannot give it a longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who have intentional to practice the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggesting this mood of mis- and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and flattering it the actual Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that rejection of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledge the tragedy. at times these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and spectators are desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, the examined, how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you'll have to thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggest something that actually may be used either from the context or in completely miscichable manner.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.Dt. insurability) endeavored to offer language avid a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these insurmountable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist are stubbornly to each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or phrase is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese and Finnish words, while the author and Linguist from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwoteca language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemass you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to have made you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunscreen language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or sloth that you feel after watching in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They deficiencies other cultures, revealing the other thought and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytellers, from Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now despite a language barrier with someone to connect?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the untouchable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written one, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland, where TLS has conducted events already since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, the diversity of diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to be dazzled.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often in this way," "" "for purposes, these events instead" "" "listen" "" "instead" "" "the listening to feel, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers press their story first in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, they conduct their devotion and their account for listening to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou conates also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative element for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after having explained the importance of his tale, John Nyamusara will be asked:" "" "how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide ridge, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can be in contact with TLS, in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrisch-Palestinian wetler Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, a annual conference dedicated to the digital culture, which is designed in Berlin, dedicated itself to the event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints's books within three to five days, lasen extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquire (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and here Licenses are available free, contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how motions of open knowledge can be built and what the true cost is, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of open knowledge, have worked on page to look over the fog, surrounds our news and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartouil, the beloved and sophisticated Internet volunteers that incarcerated in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra-prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up to extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for open source and digital activist has been in the detention of government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, transferred to an unknown village.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military policeman Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly geheim "recorded by his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insider of the Assad government and placed them aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Its whereabort and condition remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and to know the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle cultural prototypes prescient as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the imitation of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip-pull into the digital archeology and the conservation has created a time-capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Of course, this project has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life with it, dream of freedom and it taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English at even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught other incarnate to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other incarcerated how to use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a provocation, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She stirred the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free available.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Buckled by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel for 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption dispensary Director after release of release again on previous posts</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence at the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a Dioino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants because of the untreadduction of 54 million Metikal (approx. 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mosambique airports, whose council Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and demanded immediately his reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19 then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General-General Prosecutor of the Republic working out the application, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza to re-establish his old post as the company did not complete a disciplinarity after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not have the promotion well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to restore the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "poses a back to fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regress with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinarity against the resignation.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm apparently fails and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a major voice in the Mosaic social media, this behaviour also rejects and considers the case as" "" "contradictory" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and provide his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has consented to become integrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says that the director possessed no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that one is rewarded with someone in such a way that has already massively offended the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but it has only served its own country.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, when handmade money is an inexhaustible money source and the state itself, this man has become tired, recharged and eventually sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machines, remembering that a thief is in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also dissenting:</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the web, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people with Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Save" "" "(in Burmash script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely connotation connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is most commonly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts to the use of its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesic words with the different meanings that have the same letter like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' is written what the same letters contains, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (crest) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuses Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they knew how he could relieve his back pain by doing a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "cure" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hamping is the opinion that it will lessen the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also pointed out that Facebook analytic must be analytical, before all Posts extinguishers which spread in suspicion, racism to spread.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (split).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists who distribute hate speech, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to be circumcised its nationalism as well.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all that may send hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of impact often becomes a catz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are just starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I got to this new directive from Facebook, I made a post office to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and it was prohibited the lift, post and sharing of content for 24 hours because the post "Facebook Community standards did not dismiss."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who don't have any negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on hate hate crimes more radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author informed his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more on Facebook prior to the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asks for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but so it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censoring such words will only bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Moreover, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like "chair" or "inhersencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out they have made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits they had a big turnover, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automated censorship has taken care of a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now aware of Facebook and are aware of the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts that were not contained in hate speech, but still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch pesencurry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have also used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks will additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have brought thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to criticise the exhilarating hate hate on his burmesi sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context as on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The pediatriation is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament adopted unanimously on 9 June 2017 to ban the practice which this practice should forbid, so that the age-bearing age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the adulthood, some members of the Duma and muslious religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered, that the state cannot interfere with, as that, age did not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "" "" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights law, the minors as" "" "defined by minors," "" "each person under the age of 18." ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago for 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical center of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that seek to avert laws on the infancy, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children's toe, they should look forward to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition made tensions in this really complicated matter, and at some point there were doubts if the opposition would not agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the pediatriation, despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make it a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must approve and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again has:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill for pediatriation was determined by the House of Representatives with 35 votes to do so and no one on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided prior to the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users had been enthralled because the laws were finally changed to children's marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a minister in the Education Ministry, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk to pay the core of the thing, but do you know what? children's marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now, and this is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson's opinion was, it was definitely long enough to put the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:,, Hervorraging News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The Act has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The pantry age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to change the German law was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All MEPs who were against, have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The marriage-toe is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago for law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childramiage.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have taken him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "6 months ago, Maharaj has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps, should the law be passed and he seems to redeem his promise." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Generalate General Al-wi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj is acting against the law, the most social media users wish to address the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally speaking, in a way that the state, our daughters are protecting, that they might be abused by large, hard-minded men who are abused to them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children may be legal in various gradations, or continue to be the norm, although there are laws that they fail.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia contents</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was represented on 18 January 2012, contradicting to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the US, internationally distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV-series are fighting against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques were used to use locker tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been published articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held regularly after the Internet Act (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain blocked, there are now several mirrorate pages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-computer connections), which does not depend on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of a legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia) we put everything to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also that this step independently was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it's just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has a mirror-source of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to squad similar mirrorate sites if the country of Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member as well as employees at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of one proxy, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attack on another URL that is not the original one. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Basically, the server heads the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves then when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1418">The motivated him self-motivated itself to carry out a camera and try to avoid the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring back to the international stage at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town, next to Chitwan National Park, offers it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which draw attention to Nepal as a wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as he helps him to help her work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate goat photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when I suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I went with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneeling images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to acquire global recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as terribly as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing on countenance from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep not at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the poet appeared. he immediately sets up, we see ourselves and he started me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) in his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could take photographs of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist destination.</seg>

<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should respect the norm to receive this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state Odisha by a cord and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also do not name in the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less permissions to fear, if at all, they should not come out of this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, a unique club and became quickly became the main conversation subject of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the breakdown of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas for seven years working with the help of her video camera to cover practices, such as children's homes to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Infied, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in their discussion, showed the women who don't name their husbands on behalf of their spouses.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Speaking out the name of her husbands is a breadboard, that she has kept all the obligations, and have never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is regarded as a sneaky, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is deeply rooted in such a discussion that we have never made thoughts about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had previously never called her husband by name, try out at home as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time, after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started their first discotlub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" never before. some felt that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round the Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">According to the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant in the name of her husband to say with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, meaning that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the brakes of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she kissed throughout the whole exercise, and another decided to let the whole angled frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush over to have broken with an ancient fires, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she started staring, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation made in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini tells how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanic-red point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the galvanic point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased, but my, they are now in a better position to choose itself, not to carry it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the Discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with each discussion of the discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack a lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what could be" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have talked about some things, such as our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have just worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted to carry out a saline Kurta, a wide shirt about a pants, they don't drink.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion about the advantages of your own clothes-choice, morality combined with the Saris and much more, smuggled Cruini its own pair of Kurtas (Upper inhibitden) in a discussion round, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion, I have already changed something, the Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have just taken small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and are not another family members involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Papers know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the tick to make more freedom of movement or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a hard to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club each of us gives confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the incarcerated Chinese dissities Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "" "" Subversion "" "" after "" "" Subversion "" "" after having participated in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto that was involved in the democratic reforms in China. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China is referred to as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and tells a spokesman, he did it as" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, release or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are fully out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">But a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should pressure pressure to allow Liu to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Bring have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a bang after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government was speaking, that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have only been resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the message had been disseminated that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of its incarceration, he was not able to counteract its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6th, the European Parliament adopted a vote in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest, and permit him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also asked for the release of Lius as well as for the release of Lius on June 30, 2012:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to take all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27th, announced that the message sent to Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also liberate his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The invitation from the US Embassy attracted an angry response from China to itself, with the exterior of the State Department, that "no country has the right to interfere with an isolated and unanswered remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple that:</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns if the vortices around Liu could be overshadowed by visiting Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide appropriate medical care and give it the opportunity to make sure of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer, AFP previously told that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact someone outside, including its lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells on:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada asks China to comply with its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, uphold and release those rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France in France</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo gets all treatments he needs, regardless of where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family can have contact to him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news sender France has already reported that the French government Liu would welcome the country of Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information to see whether France will eventually record him.</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leaders in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed themselves very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been rigorously punished to a harmonic, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shansam, Singapore was supposed to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Lawyers of the State of New York, the Minister that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supportive that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the judiciary, "the logic to rotate" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, we can say that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, the country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shansmugam-led reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries, in view of this, he appeared inevitably indemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the issue, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers to be the prevailing democrats, since they are better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final effect, the responses in the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to its American guests regarding our press, our Judiative, our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarded with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shansmugam to make his opinion clear, as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our cheap K Shansmuggling would take the effort to clear this point if it was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">When Anon publishes his comment on the blog, he points toward criticisms that one should begin to read the entire course of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the statements of Shansmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the selection.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He enjoys Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he obviously did not meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shansmugam, which makes a leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde what was expecting me - if I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shansam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes that he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review displaces the weaknesses of Shansams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shansam" "" "credited a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudger's speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country the sovereign rights of the city go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government of the government, the statements of Mr. Shansmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Lonans make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our Prime Minister pay bills back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resources?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed a lot of Lonurer...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "defense of the country in particular" "", "but that is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices made short of his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect about your hometown or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumours of certain parts of the world and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is put to me most in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry." I am from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered a polite to show interest in his interlocutors by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my mind then follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians are maybe boil wardly ahead of anger when they are held for Americans but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible in their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">American on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - from Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There is no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is alleged to be considered the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not account me if one would switch from Dallas to an example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp. "</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: as "nice" to be called "nice" is basically to be mirror-like, gentle, but tragically inimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian doubles).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing that you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you don't want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even come so far, say that the desire to be free and alone, a major part of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders describe as" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool courtesy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not talk often about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness, which I have now connecting with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called Geistercians in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there still lived more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the 16,000 people amounted to over a decade after over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 approximately 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, he is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59- year-old, a small woman with a coral-pink ellengestell and gold-tone ear-rings in teddy-bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact trained that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Afrikaner and Haitian who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells the people in full small buses and the upper part of the coast begin to call it: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept out on Kartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to decline anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can not pay, they masking them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is recently arrived.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who studied a yoghurt) with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take normally a first stop in South America and then move toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitianer and the Africans often travel together the track and that the Africans speak at Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and has worked as construction workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">As the Brazilian economy, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest in Mama Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">MS RamÃ­rez tells her guests to send their often text messages, when they have gone to grassy or to report their about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests are taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS RamÃ­rez is well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling by Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has determined that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are to be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are there, mainly sharks.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to win money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single out, has offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers call themselves quietly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud Grandmother feed her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a clientin, some photos of her grandkids and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">They laugh sad while they put them briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeatedly repeated it every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter-users to be able to digest.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users received a mobile notification of the city of Urumqi. a mobile notification, in which it indicates the District government, to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the notification it is said that the app" "" "prevent the app" "" "to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kÃ²nated the authorities use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, having been replaced with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists, together with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, pictures, books and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornography web sites, from online fraud, trousers and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course an app with these features can naturally be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote" state actors or even hackers allow to manipulate the home network of one person or steal it from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, pressing ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media-Outlet "Images from mainland China" (be used to digest things), the censored news published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, at which policemen the residents were incalculable as if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification called that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of The The The The Consumer Electronics.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the mainland China" (meaning of the record of the cube.) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and allow full access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computer and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party, to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and with the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when running their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi. a regulation with the instruction to all the residents and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disk, notebooks and media storage."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. however, this action entails the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible failures, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallat Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + Community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallat Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallat Hdaib spends the bulk of his time inside. sometimes he lodges to his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which was heard in 1967; the year, in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as rocky (approximately: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For the past six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces conservative majority and asks their old-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and raph music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world, but he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find relevance in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and according to his own statement with the people, he can suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though it is not open to the US foreign policy, he calls for a special disinclination against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as "Palestinian winged of the second generation" - he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think because of my own circumstances," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that I am a man, while he shook into two cups in water. it is the holy month of Ramadan; it is the holy month of Ramadan; it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is envisaged for Muslims from dawn to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking up with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee in a sensing hot junk has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the sleeves are talking about hot coffee and the swaths of the Kent cigar in the nose first place of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">So it is avoids to do basic things - to drink fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens has said a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic Action front - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former prestige of the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was said "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm the commitment of the band in matters like Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that poses the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila embraced the jordal people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be easy for rhetoric, but in fact a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan reflect the appearance in Hdaib's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to Leibe by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a clearly dehydrated unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'Honmorde' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary morde in 2016 reached their peak; however, he added that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence to provide adequate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to collapse control from 1954, women who are exposed to intra-friendly violence, "at uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic expense as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, also do not shy away from themes which in his country long as taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, admits that he is his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was drawn into politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words, "what one wants" - be it faith or not belief, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were heavily censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordal OnlineProgram Roya, to be noted later that his comments from the context were swept, and in his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but there was only a working version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquire Hdaib openly for the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nusomething, a poets of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory today due to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work on behalf of the calibre later, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could write, why the Jordanier could not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitish kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the scholastic news service took several former governmental members and members of the apprenticeship, with the reason they had expressed criticism in social media with critical issues that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaibs indicate only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant place to give and taking. Jordan has drilled Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it's Hdaib - consists of slow, depressions and internal changes. he is sure that these changes are happening day by day at the heart of the jordan Society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreams not only of it, to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, streams and artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to overlap and thus also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman hears as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant warribs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory implies that the festivities, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been overthrown over a thousand years, in the armies of Japan in the North-East marched to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I looked at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortifications are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high feast was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fallen hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can produce these elaborate hair styles.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "love message to guerrilla struggles" "", "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why are we just writing love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel irritating, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went by the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Youth Foundation's campaign and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) to write letters by men.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their land showroom of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), forming the longest point of armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the signing of the peace contract as such that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the columbians, there is still a long way to come from real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerriors who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out their arms around the clock and now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, who had become accustomed to life in fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, this must now take in their ranks and assist them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla struggles to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare - which should be passed personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those forgot they need much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued to share his love with people this year, the most urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to now find their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">In the framework of the Campaign more than 2000 letters have been collected.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombian such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt reists in the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up as they had previously done to increase the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of shelter from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," the Political Sciences Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla struggles live) I saw a guerrilla shock, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because besides him on the bed a MGL-pomplight, a deadly weapon in the thorn of the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and yet I said to him," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I am answering a letter that someone wrote me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, so I answered that. "I suddenly walked the tears of the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I changed it completely and set me beside the pomegades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only way to preserve it and his six brothers in front of hunger. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know, that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned only how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the opener came students and some leaders of the FARC to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war and the FARC were already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this order, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people hear who have never heard hearing before and had no voting right now, and to realize that people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings who were turned through their circumstances and their environment was quite painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something together and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs, the Archbishop of the town Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbans was prophesied, that after the escape, peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, famine and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack arms and protest to their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people who live in the Caucasian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horror, activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of pregnant men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by the Damoklesome on the dorfLGBTQ community is not just about the night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after reports published after reports published the disappearances, torture and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, who suspects queer men and took them in secret prisons in Argun barrels.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she became grown, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya had experienced their countrymen, the hunt has been opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">They came out of fear for their lives in the end of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone took my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a familiarity from Dagestan, a transwoman who hid in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I did without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he disappeared her to his chadhenish friends, with the following message: "then there is no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents took the lap through the WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was talking about a few shopping chairs, from the backseat of my car, I heard a man's voice:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up again in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I experienced that I had two faded in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals have you been laid - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there's my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has moved respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - Related, stranger, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and a few remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The slowed to return to Chechnya, to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some told me, I must prove it by going up without through the streets; others wanted me to be in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rbchensize C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world not only your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot stir you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a knack around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them came.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the moment I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and already few hours later stood under the window a car with darkened windows and a hash shield with a 95 file.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friends tested the Numeric depiction - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I do not want to disclose their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something disbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without having to register without any identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In that moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you would be sure, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stak. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still contact your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about the gender equality, but this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I always carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I would like to have this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble as to look at the person they remember from their past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I made a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has saved a and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In order for me, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has obtained through blood Genugging.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there even more coil men held in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be no many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or were left out of their relatives to place Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there, so that they can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "should they be converted, you will show their bodies on TV and pretend they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand you?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"" "" "" "as if these people were not just vanished, they were targeted, in order to be radical." ""</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in Argun half a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have them taken.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was with himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as a bandits, so far there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who heard a so called" "" "non-traditional" "" "orientation already in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003 I was already well known in Grosny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was true, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "" "civilian terization" "", "but finally he was thrown back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were stuffed; I had colored lashes, carried out RÃ¶hrenjeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of Scharia never only has a hair trimmed for me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't have the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if those are funny about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed to the Prime Minister, he began speaking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but priority over the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had chained and denied them, regarded you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic constantly swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, meeting, I buried them to hospital and helping them to get Essential types.</seg>

<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry out a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a Trugum.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be exact, different lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be in person here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomanlasi and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay out well-thought scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should all feminist.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come across a smoother blanket sooner or later in various fields of life, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I'm suffering twice and three times.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to talk on skin color, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I chose to have been abused in racism, mentally and verbal, both in and outside the feminist movement, mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to uplift their voices and sing "Kumbaya, my lord's" to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">"" "" "" "but they do not want to talk about sexualised violence an institutionalized form of racial or racial violence, which we are exposed to black women in two times." ""</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and home cities make less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to school are referred to as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights, all the men and all the people of any skin. on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, which refuses to take into account both the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affiliation in an white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women and over and over again.</seg>

<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different hernia, and cut off from white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself fully from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than insistent me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubbornality as a novel phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement from which the black woman is concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2484">As another woman canbuena showed for abuse, the aktenant display of Ada BÃ¡ez is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women change at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men that abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be victims of violence at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really blended, Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, but not even to explain the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District State Building 9600 ads came to domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the peace process. here, 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically challenged, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Frauenministering Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On every woman who refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this, "stated they at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the suicide in Paraguay is not an own crime, the enforcement authorities cannot be adequately documented how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want that, but after all, she was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer working with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time, most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been a victim of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are happening that are too subservient because they deceive themselves from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook where they described their insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorical if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to concede that his behaviour was also a form of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain co-blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was fighting them.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need on site medical research, there are two reasons: for a lacking in the supply of global health, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread impact in the poorest countries in Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists by establishing its own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored the HIV virus, before he decided to go home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>

<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being creators.</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>

<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>

<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods are taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should they focus, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa toward western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and aggravating access to scientific expertise that are facing challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years Morton's work was only set by its own resourcefulness and the question of how many salads can get borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use it further to breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a specific red or green tone or scratched leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or cartels. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert safety provide food safety for the future of food production.</seg>

<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US-breeders can agree that others can freely use the seeds from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they can do business with their seeds, and sell it. "open source" -breeders allow others to breed their seeds to breed so own, and it is not immediately outgoing - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by stimulating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants might be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or Monsanto and Bayer are to be announced on the ever more prevalent mergers in the global agricultural industry. "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, as for example on peasant markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supplies is endangered, since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming more reduced, negligently shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has been engaged in her doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartels were protected as intellectual property, making it available to plant breeders either at all or only available.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-based plants such as wheat are patented in a bigger style as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted features - from those who have improved their taste or colour to such a due to which they thrive in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders increasingly decreases more patents. genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email, Monsanto-spokeswoman in Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company focuses on the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that" "" "intellectual property" "" "violates other breeders" "", "since" "" "patents and the protection of plant variation innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection thus inhibits innovation not, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, there certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what motivates us and it will be impossible if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton interferes in the concept of patchy, plant-characteristics: "we do not create the characteristics really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them themselves out and as breeders have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi pretenders, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who has chained a kind of kind, and has its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation of massacres, pulls in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly gentlly." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some moderate-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than B. Monsanto are patents), it creates the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors sell my varieties in a couple of years themselves, "he says." with a patent, one is 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy to do with my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "Open Source" breeding, the concept is growing rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "open-source" seed program works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, because of the Ossi obligation cannot simply become one one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent system that allows patents on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring this new line to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" -seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of plant breeders and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patent of seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still suspend the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend round the 05.August, the Egyptian government reported the site of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on selfusing.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Network for Human Rights Information remain abre- despite this attack and understanding of the Egyptian's Law and the Constitution. even though it was never so difficult to uncover these goals, so it was never so important to pursue these goals in this part of the world, so it was never so important to overcome these objectives. we insist that we will continue to fulfill our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, following more than two months ago, the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the derived network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI also there is no access to Egypt's blog and human rights research scientist Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he writes in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he was involved in order to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Bloggers, the provider of which also native to Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported by Egyptian security guards while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolves around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada led to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs are very old, however, has been a priority in the era of abdelicials al-Sisi; and even though the blockage of the blog may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was able to give me the feeling of an insult to convey; An poisoning, a try murder, prescries at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site, for whom I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thy and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 sites. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blockage of vendors that was possible through the bypassing of internetensur and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of websites, which VPNs, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to further block content and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened that the censors are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with the action to act against these actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day by day newspapers in all Brazil with scaffoles headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school" "", "Everyone's second day is assassinated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Dieb robes pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Marine and Air Force to Rio" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government organization Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so released for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio" "" "Extra" "" "on 16 August the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motifs for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that happens by the civilized standard and what only in Rio has been published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to allow us to close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not even recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that there is a war of war, if he is distorts, also to cover the atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then ask questions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose objective is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Should the term "war" more than they use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the Journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira in contrast to call the violence as "war." this is their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibilities in police accountable.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - like Extra in the analysis of the military responses in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">In the beginning this actually resulted in a withdrawal of violent deaths. since a few years, the UPP was supposed to protect from several reports on Ships and repressions against the poor congregations that should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under publication.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux reported from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years previously, a terrible civil war had been defeated between the various Mujahedin groupings that had conquered the short-term pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan was turned into a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Right at this time, Avelaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the Ghazni Province for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominated party, b-e-Wahdate had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban for their hate on the Hazara-known Taliban came closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape Avelaf found itself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coal pit. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wages and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself, to earn his livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of African refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," reminded Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we checked nylon in front of the open windows, so that we fail at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous ascent on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and ploughed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Avelaf 2002 returned to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day meal for assistance.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a second chance for distracted asylum seekers, but it is true that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are disastrous." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Rights Organisation Civil Rights Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers is accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "this is the improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unitive staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center, if they officially asked a request for asylum - which can be drawn after the registration of the asylum's month.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for an accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it is also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unstable life-enclosers helped Avelaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had done various working in the construction industry for several years, Ashsharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snlimbic bite.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Plenty of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghanistan's company founders, including cutting plants, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience to which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharper targets are however far beyond the Italian Gastronomic sector and the retail sector and aim back to the land which he had to leave amoids as a teenager.</seg>

<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by six parliamentarians, is currently in legislative as well as the constitutional committee of parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May another deputy was given a statute in which tougher penalties would be introduced to the insult of the President or of a high officials.</seg>
