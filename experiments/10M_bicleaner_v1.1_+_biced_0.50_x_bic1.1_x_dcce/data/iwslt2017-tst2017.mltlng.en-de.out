this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York @-@ Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he fores@@ had@@ owed that the NSA had illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally dra@@ ined Iran for an atomic bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible history .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t fall ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years the government has established against R@@ isen and called on to call him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and to complain about journalists .
according to the first constitutional order , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they do .
thus , when the government par@@ ked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen , therefore , lived with the risk to go to prison .
however , just days before the trial , something exceptional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been given for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the repor@@ ters and springs can always hide less .
instead of having to fail and travel through statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have been concerned without his consent , his telephone calls are secret ,
just as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel arrangements with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too busy at a lot of their work .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of being a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to a journalist .
so we set the freedom of the press , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more possibilities to pi@@ erce everyone .
but just as technology of the government allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward .
today there is a communication software that has not yet existed than ra@@ ging his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source file system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed from the internet @-@ famous , which has been developed by us , Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news Agency has access .
so the government can no longer provide information secretly , and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that are putting us all at risk .
it is important to make sure that not only technology of technology such as Edward Snowden have a chance to carry out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers .
who wants to report on griev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and who want to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ m in@@ sider , who warned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ak of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was revealing that king@@ doms and mighty men have hidden a statement . &#93; this week we were sent from messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of resident in Panama
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has res@@ igned .
also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad type firms in tax hav@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous to wait for the next release , and on the next uncovered documents .
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of a agency or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address what ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have discussed and revealing it for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these relatives .
it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans so far , who occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but through the principle behind which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we would have a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is such that you need less information in some US states to specify less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed sc@@ ams to rip especially an@@ gled investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave herself as a African Minister , who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really shocked that everyone could put forward an attorney to our investigations as he could transfer his money .
these were all preliminary entries . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anyone was handed over to anyone else . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has made suggestions to our covered investigation .
it is not about a single top political , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this might sound very dull , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but when born optim@@ ism I see quite a lot to change .
in the past few years we have witnessed more transparency towards more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the subject took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU is captured in central reg@@ isters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US comes up here .
representatives of both parties have earned a bill in both Parliam@@ entary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ hunters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and campa@@ igned by laws this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the transparency , which now makes this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally end .
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and the trunk &apos;s trunk would have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked upon my things .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me thrilled how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where sleeps you today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to enter into the trunk &apos;s trunk !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattresses . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , how to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I got stuck to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a wild bo@@ il in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed at ti@@ p@@ toes at the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he had bought from me depends today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
maybe the people , who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accomo@@ date people on my air mattresses was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate attracts and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform anxiety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I wrote about how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such a &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we also .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door went to the castle , Brian and I return .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the roles .
my former fellow @-@ inhabitants , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
so we presented to the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are using public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of room which includes doors when you pass by .
over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business , the stranger is allowed to sleep in dwell@@ ings of other people .
why ?
because we as children have learned all that stranger is dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can look at the things that you can . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through the design of immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a treasure sample , which degree confidence we bel@@ lows .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your dres@@ s@@ zone .
th@@ umbs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone to your left seat .
this quiet flight of panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your cell phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
the majority are feeling the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
for this reason our company can exist .
only time so , who now has Al Gor@@ es Handy ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he dict@@ ates the President of the President ?
you can now return your mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had to be presented once with his name ; if he would have told where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine you would have 150 assessments , all who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he really can hold very well to mobil@@ ised mobile phones ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens the trust decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest booked their jud@@ g@@ ments before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study using Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are at age and dwelling .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by judgement .
if one has less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation is com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
in addition , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much one can buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , as for example &quot; hi ! , &quot; you get rather no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells much how for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wool of works in your home ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am doing with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on what topics it should be writing .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
what we had not reck@@ oned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that has not been covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been un@@ allowed parties or have devast@@ ated dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service team . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust has been broken .
there is nothing s@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , of the 123 millions of nights , there were only a fraction of the problem .
for people are familiar with each other .
when confidence works , there can be won@@ dro@@ us results .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended up blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who have been subject to heart attack due to se@@ ated activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real protective gel that can save life even though they don &apos;t really know it correctly .
you drive one in your own car to hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a bu@@ o@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books by .
they can even stay longer without charge extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a economic trade here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships .
humans lay out a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if you travel these days , it is compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if travelling a rich buffet would be from local impressions ?
what if at any place you have visited , a group there would be ready to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub pent@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard yet ;
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground to co @-@ ordination ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have the idea of sharing a common share ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places that the government belonged ,
were were offered by the inhabitants . students who were looking for a place of stay ,
were sent to people whose children were pulled out . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , today 7@@ 85 000 people will be guests in 191 countries as a guest at a stranger or self @-@ host .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has our work done ?
aside from happiness and timing , we know that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find this astonishing ,
down@@ ward .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da travels to me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can look for design soon .
thanks .
what do you think of when you view myself ?
a believers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so , the media are the ones who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people do not speak to their users .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ dog -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ ase @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual thri@@ lim@@ ine .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ sting me .
no , not as homo@@ sexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose to wear my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you have oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to suit me a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only taken pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought after , turned into question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone percei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering in .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had a blast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes fled in buildings , people sp@@ ying out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
it is not only attacked my country but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others were told me about a bourgeois in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the USA in the USA to go to a new city and start studying .
I remember , as I ro@@ cked down -- so deep it went into my seats , and I feared the first time as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of national Islamic organizations who said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vigil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sm@@ iles in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ pled not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that one held for Muslims , war@@ ped and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fires on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who had attacked this land had attacked our land .
I have war@@ med the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is to Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that a mal@@ ignant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ ours only under review .
the alternatives are poin@@ tless because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ first and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America more secure ?
there may be a few parking spaces but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to look at people &apos;s other faith , and to show greater citizen participation .
and as the head of the police in the Washington area of Washington , DC , told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
in the radic@@ alisation process , one has noticed that he can cut online from their community , even from her family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS comple@@ tes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to her imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology reasons in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at it , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets her reading these things into Scripture .
an excellent Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each cl@@ ergy , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that their anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into difficulties .
nothing inspired and something that was given to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts that gave her a solution .
this Ima@@ m turned the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight as it concerns Islam and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , upon our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an authorit@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudices .
one study shows : if you have been reviewed testing messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they held more military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only a academic problem .
if you &apos;re looking at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election @-@ periods .
so Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to infl@@ ate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we may sense it as the first , but the toxic air of fear ow@@ es us all .
at the assignment of collective blame , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising , much promise ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her to her life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has been such an accomplished young man from my frat@@ ernity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne with her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as if he post@@ posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
it was eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we possessed it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the nursery we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , went out my shoes , went into the prayer of prayer , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked himself and welcomed our guests , for half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , ath@@ e@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who have come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you want to go to number safely ?
or will you join to those that mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve .
but I ask myself , what do you say to those who might claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ age working with deep drau@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not uncommon .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks to the Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest possible study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ yers . possible , this is possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package urge in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live in front of the public a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
through spra@@ ying , air@@ planes reach high speed and speed on the narro@@ west room .
you can also build self @-@ det@@ ectable structures .
they have learned to wear loads , to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
thus a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know collectively , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a meeting of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands exist on the highest level e. for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other Star@@ r@@ ppers , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great benefits with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a limitation of h@@ acking is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract questions that are occurring to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts , which coinci@@ de to hurt you .
decades ago we were able to fly away pilot controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ der .
unfortunately we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ator or Contro@@ llers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , it happens in the inside life very much so that it can fly stable and can move over in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right correctly .
the chance to take it properly when all of them watch is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in genius , this machine is here , the om@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
through this he receives the au@@ er@@ ful ability ;
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ate .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ists .
some things are conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made of two separate two @-@ prop@@ elled aircraft .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise sense
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , electronics or battery -- can continue to fly on the machine if limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate that by making a half air@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ warming .
the great number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units makes a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alizing technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to commemor@@ ate new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine da op@@ pres@@ sors want to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and creation of creation .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are orbit@@ ing each other ever faster , they turned into pure energy into a tenth of a tenth year .
this short moment they turned brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big boy .
but they put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time flow , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
arrange the events initially time .
1,3 billion years ago was a multi @-@ day life on the earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group was especially courageous - R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise from col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes .
most they held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could greatly increase , which greatly improved the detection capacity .
therefore , it is now called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 , L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stubborn problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes were through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the say goodbye to my deadly sick Father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked for is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist in MIT . he has been examined for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like L@@ IG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ ab in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other .
to be illustr@@ ative , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity often lead a really al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretching and reservoir , stretch and dam . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous , are .
on 14 September , for example , each one of us was stretched and stri@@ ped by us at the rising of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 performer , the L@@ IG@@ O staff was crazy for crazy .
having a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thou@@ sand@@ al of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting for the waves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are fin@@ alist and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O is more than an eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : face lifts , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by changing the light of several points coming around you .
in pots it is different .
listening notes have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean you particularly much :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like ton@@ ator and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now speaks Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob does it break down . &quot;
&quot; s@@ wimm@@ ers Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for L@@ IG@@ O the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert wav@@ y patterns into sh@@ all , we can hear all the literally .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time .
S@@ H : two black , not dre@@ dging holes , circul@@ ate : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a type of movement that engra@@ ved into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , that at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun@@ mass , which revol@@ ve around as quickly as the rods of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 others , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O opens up a completely new way to study the universe as never before .
on this way we can listen to the pi@@ d and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about space .
the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never see through , since these op@@ ters are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . I &apos;d like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the jud@@ g@@ um will be covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back until the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optimistic that all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
indeed , L@@ IG@@ O found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ des for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different angle on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say too all &quot; yes ! &quot; I was afraid of the fact that I feared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wanted to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , I feared my fear .
my fear to keep speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life , on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; estim@@ ating reasons , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak @-@ beak . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I s@@ wee@@ ten I always to play with them as soon as you request me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a striking side effect : only recently I didn &apos;t understand that the &quot; yes &quot; seed for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am writing . I think things out , we@@ aves you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate television . I productive television .
I am doing television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four broad@@ casts , four episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series will run on Thursday evening .
around the world , my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ly . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world burn .
do you know who that still does ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would like to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you all of you who work so hard , whether you are now a company , a land or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just playing on the computer and imagin@@ able , and it is true when I say : I understand that it does not work in a dre@@ am@@ job .
it is all a job , all work , all the reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I sit down in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
it is , when I set troops up , when painted on a canvas .
so , you get a high tone , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and rational . and the best thing is the buzz .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz of the city sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on her .
many people take on when I declare to them the buzz that I &apos;m writing writing them that writing me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does her .
but the buzz -- when I began working with television production , when I began working and working and working , I discovered this thing , this money , this energy . the buzz !
the buzz is more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums , then you can not seek differently than by size .
the feeling not to be different than asp@@ iring to size , no matter what price .
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not in failure , and I just know I love the buzz .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make sure : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more over@@ ly limits , the more work there are the more things at the same time , the more observe me , the more I write story , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz .
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I just this buzz ?
and then it stops the buzz .
revised , over@@ priced , exaggerated , burned .
the buzz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were recorded .
the sums of the engine was reduced .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sums were broken .
I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , penetr@@ ated weekends , no re@@ ue , nothing deleg@@ ated , nothing deleg@@ ated , is not on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
so what do you do , if what you do is doing the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you out , bl@@ iss@@ ful author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a banker , to be a mother , one painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you knew the buzz when the buzz stopped , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
I am still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out there , late it and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , magic you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , as two things are aware of :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not called me . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estim@@ able . &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan I and my buzz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters encounter this , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is excellent because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and absence of Sum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to be careful .
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist .
all that exists is sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax sti@@ pen@@ cils and the song in which it goes for letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Iron Gi@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me is dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy kick is coming in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the buzz , but a buzz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the buzz , the job@@ site , the tit@@ anium @-@ per@@ men , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz .
the buzz is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on joy .
the real buzz depends on love .
the buzz is the stream that comes from the pleasure of life .
the real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks you experience , the expectation and pressure .
the real buzz is simple and original .
the real buzz of God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered my God the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply only love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I usually do this as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play does not play to me as they work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a human being works rather than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &apos; Titan &apos; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of it is .
we moved around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we dis@@ bur@@ sting soap bub@@ bles .
thereby I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused .
I always take after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with the games ?
you can also ! tell them always Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they catch them something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ et@@ le or Ke@@ ks replaces me .
and speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more need it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children bet@@ tering .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
get yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I was vain and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprentic@@ eship , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not have a total of 15 minutes to treat ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the buzz returned to my free time . the buzz seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a couple of months a door opens , the energy is flowing and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it re@@ direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it to a full swing and love my job again .
I like the buzz , but I love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the buzz , the buzz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my buzz .
the buzz of Life .
the buzz of Love .
the buzz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful .
it is my nu@@ b that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my warehouse burn .
the more I play , the happier you are and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country , which I stopped , the marathon that I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the buzz , the other , the right sums : the buzz of life .
the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , de@@ bug@@ ging , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan -- more me !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am writing . I think things out , I awakened you to life .
this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dre@@ am@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or an automobile accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have an ab@@ iding , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
of course , they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; underground stimulation . &quot; in doing so , you have an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the schem@@ atic circles of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I received patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n &apos;s trau@@ mas , the brain increases and the skull are increasing .
to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull .
to do this sometimes you have to remove a part of cotton brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
let cells grow from a tissue in tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he looked at his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the bio@@ graphies that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal tribal cells are very active -- they share themselves very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells remained different .
they slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population that looked like stem cells but had changed in a different way .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our big @-@ stag rin@@ den@@ ds .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why stay they remain ?
we do not know that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source , which allows cerebral healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain cells from the non @-@ language area , and then the cells were able to cultivate exactly as it did Jean @-@ François did
and they subsequently highlight colour to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ pl@@ ated them at the distance of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ l@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in dig@@ ging brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they had been completely removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells we paint in vit@@ ro , in the culture shades .
here we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we tra@@ ded monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take feed@@ pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously , to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they are trying to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from injury to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now let &apos;s see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and later use it .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ate them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look in the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
one must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting me and that you have told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as uns@@ ha@@ kable ge@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven clear that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ rest friends who repeatedly told me that democracy was abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you , along with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a errors , we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ tic democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are measured , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt berg that throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only a few recognize its dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ exploited cash , which is however too anxious to invest , where it would be productive and income , with which to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the well @-@ producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , casting , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound after a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which rose at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the flan@@ ging and property prices .
thus debts and non @-@ productive capital are the twin summit , not equal through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low overall economic demand that fear that they do not invest . just like o@@ edi@@ pus Father , who would not invest . just like o@@ edi@@ pus Father , who would be out of fear , the prophecy of the grand@@ son might be true that his son would kill him if he grows .
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances led to the cause that O@@ edi@@ pus kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its exceed@@ ingly wasted art is all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further develop our lives and to finance human talent and especially to finance technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed naturally to many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to cut the importance of ath@@ ic democracy because of these out@@ si@@ ties .
the decision at the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and more important , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice weigh@@ ting in questions of the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
as a candle , which lights very bright , it is also quickly spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democracies have not been their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process applied to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone .
in our present democracies has existed since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by pushing the economy into politics , and it ent@@ ails it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today , and still not in power because the power of politics is dis@@ continued into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
when you think about it , it is roughly like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which thus sustain@@ ably nour@@ ished the animals from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy which has so far for@@ ni@@ fied itself through the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are increasing , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their enterprises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more successful of capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the well @-@ being of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retain control so as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t quite good enough .
the teaching from the Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a stand as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : the working poor is wrong !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage rings through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ define the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and consider that we are in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievement that he has brought forth , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to which the society is in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines serve human beings and put the people their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks on the meaning of life .
I believe we must be optimistic .
so what would it look like , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of &quot; matrix &quot; similar di@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies : ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a job place to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then , all income from capital and experience originate and the concept of wage work is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but do not work in it , and employees working there , but the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no longer ra@@ ging cent@@ uri@@ ous summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of the whole of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which is equivalent to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had suggested in Br@@ Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it had not had the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in the context of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they have privileged people preferred , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ note , global key@@ note .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we can decide together .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it up @-@ to @-@ date , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely ra@@ vel .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you are not ver@@ r , one thinks not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area , where the most part is , -- the area of economy -- a fully democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century today .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about what concerns democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells of violent after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ ener are curious about your experience as Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency and the constant denial that a massive de@@ duction line went through the eurozone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial --
it is right to do . unfortunately , the forces inside the euro area , within the European group , continue to deny the denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you are trying to receive a business system that is not viable due to political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism on life , one may delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it passes ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a Finance Minister , or any minister who after 6 months in office , particularly in such a tense situation , claims he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions , passed through the Eurozone .
they did not want to confess that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
that is worse than the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika has imposed on this policy which has imposed us this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive buttons of the talks , you seem to be quite per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ised and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to enter the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much for TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is executive collabor@@ ator at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes itself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very tough industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he needs to find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where you have looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need a special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
it makes more thoughts about the middle explo@@ iting , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can see each free of charge .
and if Amazon gives out all things out , do you have to feel right ?
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed during the viewing of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show when you are p@@ auses which parts you ski@@ ps or look at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide to make the show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha house landed at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time at another company , another manager has been placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is he always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ator , so the reviews they show the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed on a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic is somehow stating that it should work in everything .
if one collects millions of data for a decision that one meets , then one should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
when data analysis does not work so , this is a bit scary because we are living in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . ok , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if anyone is here in the US in prison and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company such as multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data and test companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can be pre@@ dict through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way -- through data analysis of the Google &apos;s research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sav@@ vy companies such as Amazon and Google do sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data for@@ ged in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very clever people uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or developing a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must you ever solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a first crus@@ hing this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a vast , you set the items back together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to sit down again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
that is why I believe , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they would not have been capable of . but the decision how to take all of these parts , do it again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that stood not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a huge personal risk with that decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , put this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they we@@ ave to TV @-@ ideas then as they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ issue you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably , right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will get it later with an Techni@@ k@@ demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have so far made some decisions in my life , while I should have listened to the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a much more cl@@ adding , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball ch@@ ur@@ ry and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging news , that in spite of the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
for in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
