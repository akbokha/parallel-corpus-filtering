<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York-Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he foreshadowed that the NSA had illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA had literally drained Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible history.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has established against Risen and called on to call him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers, and to complain about journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional order, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government parked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015 Risen, therefore, lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, just days before the trial, something exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been given for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of having to fail and travel through statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have been concerned without his consent, his telephone calls are secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel arrangements with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and risens's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too busy at a lot of their work.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of being a whistle-blowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the freedom of the press, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more possibilities to pierce everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is a communication software that has not yet existed than raging his book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source file system for whistleblower, which was originally developed from the internet-famous, which has been developed by us, Aaron Swartz, and is today being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where the respective news Agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer provide information secretly, and many of the information that would request it would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spy technologies that are putting us all at risk.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to make sure that not only technology of technology such as Edward Snowden have a chance to carry out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report on grievances in the supply of soldiers and who want to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a pilgrim insider, who warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" was revealing that kingdoms and mighty men have hidden a statement.] this week we were sent from messages about a leak of 11 million documents of resident in Panama</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Moselle Fonseca go and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad type firms in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars will lead to Russia's President Vladimir Putin through a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous to wait for the next release, and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of a agency or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have discussed and revealing it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who behind these relatives.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to truly understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans so far, who occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle behind which these tax havens work, Moselle Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is such that you need less information in some US states to specify less information to create a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scams to rip especially angled investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigation into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave herself as a African Minister, who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone could put forward an attorney to our investigations as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preliminary entries. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anyone was handed over to anyone else. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has made suggestions to our covered investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top political, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This might sound very dull, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But when born optimism I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have witnessed more transparency towards more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU is captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US comes up here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have earned a bill in both Parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headhunters.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy to get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians to recognize the problem and campaigned by laws this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the transparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and the trunk's trunk would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked upon my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me thrilled how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where sleeps you today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to enter into the trunk's trunk!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have a air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "say, how to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I got stuck to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild boil in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed at tiptoes at the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had bought from me depends today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people, who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accomodate people on my air mattresses was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate attracts and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I wrote about how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay at a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such a "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omeletts tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door went to the castle, Brian and I return.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-inhabitants, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the Investors: "we want to create a website where people are using public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of room which includes doors when you pass by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation would invest in a business, the stranger is allowed to sleep in dwellings of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have learned all that stranger is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can look at the things that you can. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "" "" "we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through the design of immense trust between people who had never met before." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a treasure sample, which degree confidence we bellows.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your dresszone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your cell phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority are feeling the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who now has Al Gores Handy?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he dictates the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had to be presented once with his name; if he would have told where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "imagine you would have 150 assessments, all who say:" "" "he really can hold very well to mobilised mobile phones!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens the trust decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest booked their judgments before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study using Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are at age and dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call to a person -- in our case by judgement.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much one can buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, as for example "hi!," you get rather no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells much how for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "wool of works in your home!" "" "I am doing with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on what topics it should be writing.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that has not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unallowed parties or have devastated dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked in the customer service team. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing slimmerit than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 millions of nights, there were only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, there can be wondrous results.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended up blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who have been subject to heart attack due to seated activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective gel that can save life even though they don't really know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a buoass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "this is a economic trade here." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is just a" "" "rent industry" "", "the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans lay out a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel these days, it is compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling a rich buffet would be from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you have visited, a group there would be ready to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub pentour neighborhood, of which one has never heard yet;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground to co-ordination?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the idea of sharing a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places that the government belonged,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were were offered by the inhabitants. students who were looking for a place of stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were sent to people whose children were pulled out. there were Incubator programs started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, today 785 000 people will be guests in 191 countries as a guest at a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work done?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from happiness and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downward.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda travels to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can look for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think of when you view myself?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So, the media are the ones who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not speak to their users.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-dog -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtease-Fitness-fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual thrilimine.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to ousting me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose to wear my headgear.</seg>

<seg id="278">The somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely against the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to suit me a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only taken passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, turned into question, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with each reading of the Quran.</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember, as I rocked down -- so deep it went into my seats, and I feared the first time as a Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really fires on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land had attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have warmed the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is to Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumours only under review.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-first and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people to look at people's other faith, and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as the head of the police in the Washington area of Washington, DC, told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalisation process, one has noticed that he can cut online from their community, even from her family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS completes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to her imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology reasons in their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you take a look at it, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets her reading these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An excellent Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each clergy, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that was given to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists that gave her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam turned the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as it concerns Islam and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, upon our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you have been reviewed testing messages in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they held more military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election-periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public in order to inflate the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may sense it as the first, but the toxic air of fear owes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">At the assignment of collective blame, it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, promising, much promise...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her to her life. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has been such an accomplished young man from my fraternity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as if he postposted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">It was eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We possessed it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, went out my shoes, went into the prayer of prayer, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked himself and welcomed our guests, for half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you want to go to number safely?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have made a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask myself, what do you say to those who might claim that you are a TEDTalk, a denkerage working with deep draught, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't. I am completely normal.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial dryers. possible, this is possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package urge in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France live in front of the public a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through spraying, airplanes reach high speed and speed on the narrowest room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-detectable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system autonom works, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a meeting of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, computations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands exist on the highest level e. for example" "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrppers, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and has great benefits with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hacking is that they react sensitive to turbulence like wind-bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract questions that are occurring to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts, which coincide to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago we were able to fly away pilot controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a whistleder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No clapping, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuator or Controllers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, it happens in the inside life very much so that it can fly stable and can move over in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to take it properly when all of them watch is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in genius, this machine is here, the omcopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Through this he receives the auerful ability;</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotate.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellists.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things are conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two-propelled aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise sense</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls out, electronics or battery -- can continue to fly on the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">"" "" "" "we will now demonstrate that by making a half airworthy." ""</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">The great number of autonomous, co-ordinated units makes a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- every single one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localizing technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to commemorate new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine da oppressors want to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and creation of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures allowing them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are orbiting each other ever faster, they turned into pure energy into a tenth of a tenth year.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they turned brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time flow, and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago was a multi-day life on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand up with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group was especially courageous - Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational waves, which arise from collidizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser Interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could greatly increase, which greatly improved the detection capacity.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collidizing black holes were through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the say goodbye to my deadly sick Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist in MIT. he has been examined for 23 years of gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cab in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To be illustrative, lecturers in courses for relativity often lead a really albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and reservoir, stretch and dam."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each one of us was stretched and striped by us at the rising of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 Nulls after comma, followed by a 1 performer, the LIGO staff was crazy for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">Having a five kilometres long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandal of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, hunting for the waves" "" ":" "" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are finalist and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: face lifts, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for this way you can make a picture or a map of things by changing the light of several points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Listening notes have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like tonator and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now speaks Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob does it break down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"swimmers Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavy patterns into shall, we can hear all the literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has already been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not dredging holes, circulate: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement that engraved into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, that at least I never forget -- heard LIGO:... two black holes with each 30-fold sunmass, which revolve around as quickly as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 others, revolve each hundred times a second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens up a completely new way to study the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the pid and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super-nova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen at the core, which is behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since these opters are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. I'd like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the judgum will be covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, LIGO found equal in the first attempt things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the saurierknodes for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different angle on the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say too all "yes!" I was afraid of the fact that I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "" "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all "estimating reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak-beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I sweeten I always to play with them as soon as you request me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side effect: only recently I didn't understand that the "yes" seed for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am writing. I think things out, weaves you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create television. I productive television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four broadcasts, four episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series will run on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world, my series in 256 regions run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendly. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you all of you who work so hard, whether you are now a company, a land or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I am not just playing on the computer and imaginable, and it is true when I say: I understand that it does not work in a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all the reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I sit down in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops up, when painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So, you get a high tone, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational. and the best thing is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz of the city sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on when I declare to them the buzz that I'm writing writing them that writing me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, this does her.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with television production, when I began working and working and working, I discovered this thing, this money, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such sums, then you can not seek differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be different than aspiring to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not in failure, and I just know I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make sure: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more overly limits, the more work there are the more things at the same time, the more observe me, the more I write story, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overpriced, exaggerated, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimating, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, penetrated weekends, no reue, nothing delegated, nothing delegated, is not on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do, if what you do is doing the work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Heul you out, blissful author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, to be a mother, one painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz when you knew the buzz when the buzz stopped, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">I am still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "South-state waitress" "" "ask me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out there, late it and she says," "" "Mama, magic you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, as two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not called me. "</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimable."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan I and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "so she says," "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters encounter this, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is excellent because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and absence of Summing, I can do nothing except to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists is sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax stipencils and the song in which it goes for letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Iron Gigin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy kick is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the jobsite, the titanium-permen, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and television lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the pleasure of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks you experience, the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz of God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered my God the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply only love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I usually do this as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play does not play to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a human being works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself 'Titan' --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of it is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We moved around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disbursting soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them always Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they catch them something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marietle or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more need it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children bettering.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Get yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I was vain and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the apprenticeship, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not have a total of 15 minutes to treat?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz returned to my free time. the buzz seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a couple of months a door opens, the energy is flowing and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it redirects me to new ideas. I use it to a full swing and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my nub that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my warehouse burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier you are and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country, which I stopped, the marathon that I run, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the other, the right sums: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, debugging, naked and new feeling of life in me. less Titan -- more me!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am writing. I think things out, I awakened you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have an abiding, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Of course, they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "underground stimulation." in doing so, you have an electrode deep in the brain to influence the schematic circles of the neurons so that neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberphysician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I received patients with skull-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that at the skull-Hirn's traumas, the brain increases and the skull are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to diminish the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this sometimes you have to remove a part of cotton brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Let cells grow from a tissue in tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He looked at his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biographies that stem cells are unmature cells that can transform itself into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share themselves very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells remained different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, weird cell population that looked like stem cells but had changed in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our big-stag rindends.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they remain?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"" "" "" "we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries." ""</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source, which allows cerebral healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain cells from the non-language area, and then the cells were able to cultivate exactly as it did Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight colour to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we replated them at the distance of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autotranlant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reproduce the same cells in digging brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they had been completely removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells we paint in vitro, in the culture shades.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we traded monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feedpellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously, to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they are trying to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached the degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now let's see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use it.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implate them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look in the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting me and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unshakable gedness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have proven clear that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my unrest friends who repeatedly told me that democracy was abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, along with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a errors, we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a true and defenceltic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are measured, our future bleak and our great, new technologies" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin" "" "Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt berg that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unexploited cash, which is however too anxious to invest, where it would be productive and income, with which to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the Eurozone, in all the well-producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, casting, equipment, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound after a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which rose at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the flanging and property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and non-productive capital are the twin summit, not equal through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low overall economic demand that fear that they do not invest. just like oedipus Father, who would not invest. just like oedipus Father, who would be out of fear, the prophecy of the grandson might be true that his son would kill him if he grows.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances led to the cause that Oedipus kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its exceedingly wasted art is all the unproductive capital should be used to further develop our lives and to finance human talent and especially to finance technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"" "" "" "but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?" ""</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed naturally to many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to cut the importance of athic democracy because of these outsities.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision at the athic democracy was and is that they were the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and more important, giving them the right to political co-determination with the same voice weighting in questions of the government.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle, which lights very bright, it is also quickly spread.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our present-liberal democracies have not been their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process applied to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies has existed since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, by pushing the economy into politics, and it entails it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government today, and still not in power because the power of politics is discontinued into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">When you think about it, it is roughly like a flock of carnivores, which thus sustainably nourished the animals from which they are nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy which has so far fornified itself through the self-causing economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are increasing, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their enterprises." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the well-being of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" retain control so as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it wasn't quite good enough.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a stand as in the ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor is wrong!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage rings through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we need to redefine the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and consider that we are in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "as an documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievement that he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to which the society is in "Star Trek" in which machines serve human beings and put the people their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks on the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like, how could it look like this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of "matrix" similar diystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from a job place to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all income from capital and experience originate and the concept of wage work is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but do not work in it, and employees working there, but the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no longer raging centurious summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of the whole of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which is equivalent to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had suggested in BrBretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the context of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberating, in which they have privileged people preferred, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynote, global keynote.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we can decide together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it up-to-date, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertary Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am completely ravel.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not verr, one thinks not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area, where the most part is, -- the area of economy -- a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say that provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century today.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about what concerns democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of violent after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listener are curious about your experience as Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to self-sufficiency and the constant denial that a massive deduction line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was, which revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the forces inside the euro area, within the European group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you are trying to receive a business system that is not viable due to political will and authoritarianism on life, one may delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it passes abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Finance Minister, or any minister who after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claims he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the distortions, passed through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to confess that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">That is worse than the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika has imposed on this policy which has imposed us this policy:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive buttons of the talks, you seem to be quite per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, the released fliers will be demonised and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to enter the path of a post-modern 1930 what it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you very much for TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive collaborator at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes itself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very tough industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he needs to find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "The Wire" "", "The Wire" "", "" The Wire "" "," where you have looked at a season, your brain asks, "" "" Where are there more of these episodes? "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need a special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It makes more thoughts about the middle exploiting, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price wants nothing to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can see each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out all things out, do you have to feel right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed during the viewing of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you are pauses which parts you skips or look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide to make the show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican U.S. Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha house landed at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company, another manager has been placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming design of Netflix. just like Roy is he always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it but he makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix spectator, so the reviews they show the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has landed on a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic is somehow stating that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data for a decision that one meets, then one should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work so, this is a bit scary because we are living in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. ok, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone is here in the US in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company such as multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data and test companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can be predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way -- through data analysis of the Google's research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data savvy companies such as Amazon and Google do sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data forged in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"" "" "" "must you ever solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first crushing this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a vast, you set the items back together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to sit down the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to sit down again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I believe, Netflix was so successful, because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they would not have been capable of. but the decision how to take all of these parts, do it again and make a show like "House of Cards" that stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a huge personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, put this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first as they weave to TV-ideas then as they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-issue you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "probably, right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it later with an Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "I have so far made some decisions in my life, while I should have listened to the ball." ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know naturally, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a much more cladding, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball churry and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging news, that in spite of the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
