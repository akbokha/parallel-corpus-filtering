Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where young people today should meet .
a pit @-@ chapel , where now stands for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the single reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it is nervous when land maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had already had an upright position because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was held instead of a byp@@ assing road a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ o @-@ Portal of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but is therefore very conclu@@ sive .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then it is clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one does not recognize as such .
in the large over@@ sight map for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called urine @-@ sheets , were incorporated .
these were written according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Constitu@@ ent Administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ent@@ ail the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ ide occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bay@@ er@@ on - of course to military purposes .
even if the French troops went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph had progres@@ sed the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional blatt for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all other on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison of early morning is most impressive at the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
Send@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ le are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße that was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance : with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbers with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als , &quot; which was derived from the basic tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not prove to be farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October Revolution , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the fan , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse p@@ aving once people with madness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circuit @-@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard led the establishment of the institution - the psychiatr@@ ist who is brought to King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accus@@ ation of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has banned the personnel to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East since 2006 is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiatr@@ ists .
the young Au@@ er Anst@@ alt area will now meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked in a teen@@ ager with training .
west is the football ground of the TS@@ V München East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , one set up the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architec@@ tur@@ ally tense to the country building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombar@@ d@@ ment .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as the main square , the Kauf@@ man street was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of the Allies were torn in the city centre in December 1944 .
one big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages had once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are working and performed on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S railway line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil rights group released travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ souri due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory council for the federal state of Mis@@ souri , which should come into force until 28 August 2017 , where travelling through the State needs special attention and be expressed in the first caution , since a number of frag@@ mentary , r@@ all@@ ure events occur in the whole state and here will be noted , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it difficult to gain a crime of discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the State , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have been bre@@ aches of the civil rights , people happen .
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they will be collap@@ sed or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist intervention against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Secretary @-@ General of Mis@@ souri , in which black motor@@ ists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring interest or relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crimes reporting programme of F@@ BI , which set the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to shor@@ ten a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil @-@ liberties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration laws had to ple@@ dge the local law enforcement authorities to prohi@@ bit people because of immigration law , which according to AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to another breeding .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department of Foreign Affairs , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dez@@ vous project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundest@@ ags from Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac gained a picture on the spot .
at the Recht@@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ demann family representatives met Thomas Schneider and the two MPs together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann gave us insights into his farm in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals , and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative driving force for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste comes exclusively region@@ ality .
as he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fis@@ her@@ b@@ ans , he called the Wei@@ dez@@ vous project as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I cannot put on such steep surfaces not profitable .
the green @-@ surface area for much work , a lot must be processed with the engine mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the terms and conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if it is not a bio@@ enterprise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commune has recognized the meaning of the consecr@@ ation project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be moved still a whole while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they bring their business further , &quot; stressed the mayor .
farmers are often in criticism because of funding
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure surface is about 40 hectares , which must not be neglected until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of fisher@@ man .
thus , the farmers love 12 6@@ 10 euros , who had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of wheat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land women it is not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ es @-@ linear ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ of @-@ government promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequis@@ ites is the presence of one of the L@@ PR derived subsidies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the in@@ conclu@@ sive surface may not be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ang@@ incl@@ ination about 35 percent ) and must be threatened with indign@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fisher@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ vous project 2018 at the moment the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence .
the disclosure surface is equivalent to 35 hectares , the low @-@ mounted costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the President for dr@@ astic immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller reached not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of the boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have spar@@ ed him if he had done it .
but he laid their meaning , and in particular the meaning that her was written when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... an American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller lies properly properly , but as he shaped it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary response to the stir@@ s words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your nat@@ ured , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who y@@ earn for it , free to breathe , / the el@@ ding waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to be seen on our screens .
Miller got involved not in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps US .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by pointing in an un@@ used classical diagram showing the feminine embodiment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract , she has received one voice .
and she gives himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant coffee and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to switch back from the right wing this for a long time .
the great cry as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one , but rather an early ne@@ oc@@ on , which bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ches should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here pushed onto something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever recognize .
her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ad@@ orable .
championship 2017 : Neil Black commen@@ ds Scottish members of the Kingdom of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminis@@ cent of a time when only two jack@@ ets to the team were among the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance of the L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member piece of cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we figure it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the stre@@ et@@ corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals and candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which can be traced to Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected from the crew to team@@ rider .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is fairly modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tically or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought very naturally , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which will compete at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 jack@@ ets are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid @-@ hau@@ l Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman which , after a great season , which was awarded the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle reminis@@ cent of her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the Mann@@ it@@ ts capit@@ al@@ in says that they are &quot; huge &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also join the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; what is special about the team of the team is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the sho@@ ot@@ toes which belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ des .
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and to profit from it , that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just as a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking criticism about Facebook : Be@@ ver@@ b not to send you a public office if you cannot tolerate the def@@ endant of voters
the father of our country knew some of the poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers sm@@ ote it because of everything , from the interior policy up to its political principles .
he stim@@ ulates in the critique , secure .
but he did not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ m , we are led as the sheep to the battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work on it to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Rights Union def@@ endant him at the beginning of this week .
the chairman of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ d@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of an bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot; .
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state , which is surprisingly popular .
it has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary Hitler head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary agent to combine with his voters and to debate his ha@@ il@@ ess head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ ak spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too simple to use the image of dri@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ash@@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thought@@ fully and not profound .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not filled in water , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I had commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people takes on the same issue , then they are dis@@ respected by some rather than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Staff of Govern@@ ors were referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advoc@@ acy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or hide demonstrators and sil@@ enced .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise that he sha@@ k@@ ens Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a vot@@ er of their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time Washington &apos;s time had similar effects on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelope to his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous trop@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , came across his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project .
but he did not sil@@ enced it .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days on domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost in the Arch@@ er@@ field left until the end of the last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new au@@ ten@@ ure and acts as a tournament message in the name of the Association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ cul@@ ling of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ al is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion on the home .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .

less lung cancer through passive exposure
over the past two decades fewer people have died because of pas@@ siv@@ ating to lung cancer .
this result obtained scientists from the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates per year 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases of pas@@ sports smoke is attributed to liabilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Studien@@ Manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases because of pas@@ si@@ ties per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat &quot; in time , &quot; so the leader of the Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the range of the car@@ ts , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much ge@@ berge , which is not marked in the plans .
the traffic , which is still impe@@ ded the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists from red traffic lights and lock@@ ers is already huge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are entitled to a walk .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks the dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually calls a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - right into the fireplace .
after half an hour the cr@@ acked cr@@ olle is taken with di@@ lig@@ ently , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay side - she does not have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water out of the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ hing .
as the youngest of the four wives of their man , you have not been assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there is the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody is dar@@ ing to wander in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua New Zealand , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders vote in front of the crew forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly to the government of Jak@@ arta who co@@ operates control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated subjects , which were converted by r@@ ust in different gel@@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , wei@@ rd because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans hon@@ ed a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates its lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , its dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; formerly we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indones@@ ian poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable Gold mine of the world , grass@@ lands , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has built Free@@ port in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition , Papua with wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia of Indonesia retain a sti@@ cking presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local dairy farmers and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian calls for greater autonomy to threaten these golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military , tor@@ tured and incar@@ cer@@ ated .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal up@@ land in the 1970 @-@ er years were established according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police died last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Brisbane held in 2016 , in the reports of atrocities and torture , rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims since each week &apos;s incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have ampli@@ fied , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources are bringing a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments have changed since Muslim economic migrants are from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ cant@@ ons sell baked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ ts .
local people are fighting to participate here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to work .
&quot; it has the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama : the women &#93; of Papua - its market cost . &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ s and as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address inequalities and the violations in Papua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann insured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua a little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i with the expectation he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep @-@ point in October only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is initiation .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the ro@@ cked children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in her tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who drank , mour@@ ned , and sm@@ ote the group with its def@@ ences , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Tribunal center to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting ground and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird spon@@ ge in@@ iti@@ zing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to tow stones at police and military post .
when the mood came up was sent to the soldiers a command over an internal spark : &quot; if the masses were more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME , which has not been released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
Kay@@ ams still does not know who fired , but say that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ot@@ ings was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indones@@ ians only one name , the T@@ IME into dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor of the Papua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to be attacked because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if men threaten to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many more injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings were only fil@@ tered on the next day &apos; after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and swe@@ ar to address the historic abnorm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that this case will be solved immediately so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety ministers Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism to set up historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the aliens began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a withdrawal when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he didn &apos;t have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto that accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ul repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a building company that refused to bring an unconscious husband to hospital , a person and 17 others have been injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ is@@ cated in a nearby river died on the way to hospital .
asc@@ ended villagers prot@@ esting before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
the police told that the villagers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by war@@ nuts .
but natives say that the mobile Brigade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the hospital and witness , as the last one has been delivered quickly , so the T@@ IME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament is called to hold the officers responsible to account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a temp@@ t for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensory development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua , by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of ind@@ on@@ ese soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and taken arbitr@@ arily , under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , for@@ ci@@ er place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the bit of rice , that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is expensive for locals .
bread is as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to be able to edit four or five fields of conf@@ ection@@ ery .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a co@@ iled only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete for their own business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation continues the eyes of the world from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media are tense .
at the beginning of the year the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is campaigns to raise the restrictions of reporting to foster transparency and development , not implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report on Indonesia , un@@ quiet most eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states called Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man by the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of State Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r referred to the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , held under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , jour@@ ne@@ yed their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia launched another presidential election , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai jack@@ ets , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in impover@@ ished educ@@ ators and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , have to consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ation conducted a last symbolic act of the rut : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they may know that they may never come up with justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with ges@@ ted head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its through@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that has been swe@@ pt through the strongh@@ old in just two years , that one can coinci@@ de the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injury was not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the ligh@@ test and scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked on the provision of accommodations for the affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can cause questions about safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world .
a study carried out by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ Building after its fire in 2015 that the largest part of the damage caused by the dis@@ guise , the outdoor clothing for decoration or isolation .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing on the London @-@ fur @-@ tower in June could have contributed the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : ongoing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) is through its big Davis Cup coupon at the A@@ GM .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the race for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single @-@ party was only supported on two pay@@ outs but is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
this is often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics remain the traditional status .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only scarce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the rating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , not only for the vote was the proposal that won the finals on a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;

more than 1 of 5 US travelers bringing b@@ inger items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted among passengers , that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consciously exp@@ elled items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration by s@@ mug@@ ged , among them at least 6 percent , who frau@@ dul@@ ent the plane while they accidentally carried out def@@ aul@@ ted kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed them , they could have noticed that they have travelled er@@ ron@@ eous with bul@@ lets , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted more than 1,000 people - one of a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was performed - also noted that younger travelers rather dis@@ respect the rules .
from the respondents , the gave they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were deliberately subject to T@@ SA agent , were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent they gave to know@@ ingly have carried out objects with blades by the security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respondents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male counterparts also confirm that they had inten@@ tionally der@@ eg@@ ed drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it was asked for travellers around the country to find out how many accidentally caused s@@ mug@@ gling by the airport security and how many had been pur@@ pose@@ fully done .
it is no surprise that the people , the most s@@ mug@@ gling s@@ ke@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - by the safety carry those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids should take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated from the T@@ SA s objects .
for a while , the people , the T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mug@@ gling .
fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thou@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives you the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ stated that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers on sales points and even more gigantic withdrawal targets , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , which has just started .
now , Mus@@ k is a : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have been withdrawn 6@@ 3.000 already again .
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservation .
in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , spatial Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth objectives lies not in demand , but on the production site .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles delivered .
in 2018 , all models will be assembled - 500,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand new , never tested in practice with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum util@@ isation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the inter@@ connection of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for then the company cannot prevent the un@@ satisfied customers to run away in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
EPA @-@ Chief Pru@@ itt draws itself due to the advent of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions
one day after he has been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , his former decision came back to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air lubric@@ ants .
Pru@@ itt presented the change , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities in front of reaction faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit was raised against his previous job in a federal court .
it is about a deadline that ran out on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for ground floor area of o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt announced that he would delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the Plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , long time ago was a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection rules .
since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ itt has gone over to block regulations or delay to resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal framework for the Pru@@ denti@@ al roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Ministry of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded his authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening opinion , Pru@@ itt suggested that his turn@@ around at O@@ zon@@ ate was simply the willingness of EPA for cooperation with the states in the complex process of timely satisfaction of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administration , EPA has often not respected the deadlines for carrying out and then waited for the appointment of activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and in an agreement struck the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pru@@ itt , who def@@ endant the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that there is us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion that Pru@@ itt at some point will take its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to be delayed and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use all the other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress will push for a broader new collection of o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved in the last month &apos;s draft law should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up to the vote in the Senate .
the New Yorker &apos;s General @-@ General Eric Le@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who warned the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.5 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the smo@@ g which is p@@ iled in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cutting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil raff@@ in@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the de@@ grade smo@@ g can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature death every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprising course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to viol@@ ate environmental contam@@ inate and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to an Seren@@ ade .

visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of the tumor to their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i emphasized : &quot; it is a unique village of village . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg . &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the sanctuary of the parish church , also a splendid courtyard , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right belonged and not the other way round .
so there were people in there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the delightful settlement of the village .
old maps from the time to 1600 under@@ pin this historical situation .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval Fe@@ kir@@ k right .
a Lord , who built a church , settled and occupied with a pastor , continued to have owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with it was the right to act as a pastor or to propose a new parish priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater the two sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell hat@@ ched then for the first time 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .
17@@ 96 en@@ camp@@ ed French troops near the church .
they bra@@ ked out the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery had been extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was stopped .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m left you stand .
in the New Years &apos; s , 18@@ 34 sp@@ obsol@@ ete a storm the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half storms .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was interrupted .
only the present turtle still remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em managed by the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius equipment .

society wants to test permission from wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aving itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned towards the country of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aving itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted land@@ board Andreas Co@@ ed ( CD@@ U ) to rec@@ laim its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal exists a wind power concentration camp .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time it causes the concentration zone but a expul@@ sion of wind use for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent a &quot; sealing &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power plan for a second wind power plan in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which , however , had not approved the District Government in Düsseldorf , because of a form of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the shared per@@ secu@@ tions is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rec@@ eding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council has again decided on the summer break the wind @-@ concentration zone in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the creation of approval for the establishment of wind turbines was legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of a request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been noted for past weeks in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to examine the matter again .
but they are not likely to carry out that the procedure will be stopped .
with a view to ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle wanted no content on Thursday to speak at the arg@@ umentation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wheels .
already last year , the company , which is involved in the City of Vier@@ sen , is closed in eight hectares with the owners of about 65 hectares of large estates .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - that is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens Urban was given green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor c@@ rank@@ y together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident has happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between the Wal@@ lo@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal with it .
two other people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained locked over hours .
according to police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove with their car in the frame of the accompanying driver with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion person the L 3@@ 33 in direction Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ ar and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city center .
like the chair of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; will sensi@@ tise the customers for making the offers of their own city away from the usual supermarket merchandise .
thus , a market with regional suppliers , is similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training locations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only for residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the industrial and commerce Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the commercial association and the city into a further stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offers such as the first &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; for the Brun@@ nen@@ firm and sold @-@ packed Sunday , discussions with all entrepreneurs and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and ren@@ unciation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ opened or opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city center while shopping from a glance .
in the end all would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city center - to landlords , the farms of the whole city and Ver@@ one .
it used to overcome le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that had been partly wide , had king in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Chief of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared that the first third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are taking part .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ ligh@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and place its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners is also clear that every citizen might influence its direct impact on the environment .
two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school
during construction work there came to a gas @-@ blast in the school building .
new more people have been injured .
at a gas blast in the US @-@ city Minneapolis are two people killed and nine have been wounded , some of them were heavy .
according to the fire brig@@ ade was on Wednesday ( local time ) still a hur@@ tful in critical condition .
a man died , as part of a school building on the explosion .
a first mis@@ ses was also born dead later .
at the dead it was the wor@@ shipped of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as un@@ happiness he assumed the authorities work on a gas guide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the holiday season only a few people held in the building of Minne@@ haha Academy .
p@@ umping after sli@@ pped trans@@ criptions by telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription by telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Leader of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump in a phone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President decides him because he had promised the Wall publicly . repor@@ tedly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his Presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to leave Mexico for the project .
trans@@ crip@@ ts of his first appeal with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. sne@@ ak that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; says &quot; Bel@@ mies , &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the continu@@ ance was made on the trade that would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump closes the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists lead to rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block its path .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle aged in a needle @-@ strip - took a long turn to his cig@@ ar and looked after by the wind@@ shield .
inside web@@ s the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brunette the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams were torn as a young black man from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately this terrible scene is played , which was played on July 22 , only a follow @-@ up .
but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of them in the audience are very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 Ombud@@ sman for Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it really is irre@@ pres@@ sible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the after@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Congress of Congress Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end up , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial system puts a beg@@ gar on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ girl on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ pro in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but none was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on a free foot for decades , citizens said that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time to vote in the summer for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the F@@ BI &apos;s choice , Roger Mal@@ com had a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when she was then removed from the prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the murder , proo@@ fs and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral threshold , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; when you register and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade ago , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their account is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ignant , and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many believe he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are then confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have been doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - started to have a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the leader of the leader , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story to life because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester en@@ cri@@ es and pus@@ hes it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -@@ -- he , swal@@ low from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona inv@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene battle on the lau@@ er .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n -@@ -- he said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just need to make the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ship replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona , the N @-@ word says , he states it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is cry , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and carries Billi@@ e Holidays sad speech &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it &quot; from .
your voice is breaking on every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen people &apos;s sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders has remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de , the air feels donated .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feed and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes he would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sil@@ l away and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms together , the emotional burden of performance breaks after him through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience deals with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the succession with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words , which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you yourself and who do what they look like you &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police @-@ shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the follow @-@ up is in some way inspir@@ ational , for it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .

in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is directed to a color@@ fully @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the screen@@ stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) either shows a sh@@ ab@@ by corner corner with a wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before , I par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the R@@ igh@@ ter pos@@ ing as rock @-@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an I@@ setta .
stu@@ d oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that runs through his &quot; ring &quot; staging .
the three R@@ igh@@ s - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
k@@ ess they perform Sie@@ g@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , zer@@ ren in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier , a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious fi@@ eses that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ rate .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Sie@@ g@@ fried .
later , still Gun@@ ther ( Markus Ei@@ che ) must believe .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who prot@@ rude and de@@ ple@@ ted the hands for Merkel @-@ smoking .
big applause is there for the Fest@@ spiel@@ chester , which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the great heat back in closer leisure clothing .
with tension expected was the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regional Technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he still had to leave a green concert concert about himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ fe went . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about it .
&quot; one re@@ alizes that the public has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of his view .
I draw a positive reset .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a Volun@@ te@@ er
they work in their voluntary year equal to several locations .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture pur@@ se , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the bridge .
and I have already worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are 26 years now , so a bel@@ ated Volun@@ te@@ er Volun@@ te@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does this come about ?
quantity : I have made SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineer , we say , successful dis@@ continued .
I have known for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is a look at it , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe too , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social activities during the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual @-@ study , probably do a social work@@ book in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studies in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not uncommon to have several different applications during voluntary service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always comes to where you can be FS@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it truly runs .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to expect stub@@ s .
one always has other people pre@@ fers who each have a very different story behind them .
whether a fu@@ eling , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught out of the family - you always have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , lots of kindness .
there are also a negative moments , but that is how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts other 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut more 3.000 jobs and cut their cli@@ dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced .
in addition to its previous restructuring , the Direc@@ torate @-@ General John Fall@@ on largely announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which already 4,000 jobs were lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme for a reduction of more 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after the first half of the year I achieved a total increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ icide
a su@@ icide bom@@ bed has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato . and several others viol@@ ates , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , shared an explanation of Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , died also three civilians .
the bombing is the last atro@@ city that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ lasted two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato , it is said to be an explosion on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; by persons cons@@ ented explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Air@@ field Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , including 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ motor@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly complex district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they could have carried out this attack .

EPA has to make decision to del@@ aying the Smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the US American environmental protection authority has a decision to wai@@ ve a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled what the states are obliged to capit@@ alize the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states failed to def@@ use the Agency for the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone @-@ 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they will show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in which to be measured in a part of the country pollut@@ ants to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to delay even more stringent air quality standards - to delay up to October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , reached on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental publishers who imposed on President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have triggered the back @-@ back of the Democrats and reserves , who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reinforce the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
com@@ der@@ ate wants a common room
in the end the decision was clear : with two counterparts , the con@@ flu@@ ence of flu@@ orn winds the establishment of a community space in the future sen@@ iors .
ahead of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing object cl@@ utter@@ ed was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ad .
although it will still take place until now the Church &apos;s Church is owned by the Church , but there is no planning stage for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion regarding a community space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat was offered to meet the municipality .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the council &apos;s council ho@@ vers in such a common room , not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair housing , but open to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the current budget last autumn has been decided , by means of funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a community space would be , so reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent per cent con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
the decision pre@@ viewed to sign@@ alize the investor that one does not want to throw it in this respect that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which is in the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the tear down and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less , so does not only mean Wil@@ fred sole , be this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the Panel .
not so easy it goes with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of her own buildings with which one cannot move so right now , for that time the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely essential for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ vention of any dispute or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the purchase of the surface you don &apos;t give a grant , but only get a real , in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech reads .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request for the decisions to be charged accordingly , finds three prop@@ onents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counterparts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision so we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the last but not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old however believes in a performance in the first official mandatory stop of the season .

in Har@@ z from Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z the nationwide first &quot; Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to be created .
this is planning the Verein Stern@@ warte San Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the information in need of many har@@ b@@ visits , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up on the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accessible installations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ question Che@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ eh and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets should be comple@@ mented by internet .
that is why the output of output is a good mobile network reception .
also accessibility is an crit@@ erion .
later , the star@@ gate train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the ast@@ er@@ trail , the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars could have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , even though it is much further away .
I will also be taught in which constellation can be a sel@@ f@@ ished star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest located observ@@ atory of Northern Germany .
the site is located in the heart of the National Park Har@@ z , according to the Federal Ministry of Natural Protection , to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda @-@ galaxy are clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the UNI @-@ city , there has been an initiative of Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned ast@@ er@@ rati@@ os - the planet path .
beginning before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up with his st@@ aves up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ ards ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ aves with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly at the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a bul@@ let of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away the sun sets 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the whole distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light requires from Sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good hour up to the pole with Plu@@ to .
pedestrian are faster than light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ star but would take a half a year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am up for bronze &#91; to 140 Po@@ unds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and op@@ ed later open to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;

four wounded after tire plat@@ zer
after an accident on the A7 , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira won a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 am shortly before the connection of the market wide , presumably after a tire plat@@ ter will be in control of his vehicle .
the car drag to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ struck himself and then lie on the roof in the green belt .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction of North for about an hour , subsequently the traffic could be subject to the left lane at the accident point .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hope for the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings .
the first season was Andre Hoffmann satisfied with the result also , because they were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains , the triple ette is also to be optimized further .
and a gate after a free go @-@ up would also no longer want to catch up the Fort@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will turn to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the triple ette , than with the Four@@ teen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer &apos;s helmet Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is his thing for sure , &quot; because we just got in the triple room on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford as much play@@ capacity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course also Hoffmann go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one can speak after an un@@ decided about a mis@@ used start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I assessed only after six to eight days of play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cem@@ eter@@ ies , who don &apos;t want to speak of an advantage compared to Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be fres@@ her because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a Ascension ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the guests from the Rhein@@ land go as a slight favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says funk , the balance sheet with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which one must hit by &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas boss &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and over@@ he@@ ther . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Fun@@ cle wants to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for research medicine ( puzzles type ) has started with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum process that the age of age should be more precise after the Swedish migration authority ( mig@@ r@@ ations ) of mistakes in the evaluation of the proper age of some refugees were critic@@ ised .
until now mig@@ r@@ ations of 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 testing from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person could possibly 18 years or older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are resistant .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has frozen over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 testing and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person studied 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 results found , it noted that in the 243 of these cases the person had said that they will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical assessment , in the x @-@ rays of white @-@ teeth and MR@@ I recordings were made of knee @-@ wr@@ ists , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tical is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very unsafe .
if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the paper metro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency however defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is barely below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ows , builders at the department of street and transport in the government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time at all three re@@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is for sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault @-@ bridge from concrete , which is clo@@ th@@ ed with red bun@@ ts@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
as the two other bridges too , it is now in the years .
to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red bun@@ ts@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ cken@@ f@@ appe .
it is a edge fix , which is also used as a factory path .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge should be deployed on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre @-@ wide bridge cap .
this is then the road to the pedestrian road go .
the special thing is that it concerns manufacturing parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge @-@ arms .
special finger@@ tips has a special feeling of wir@@ ing through the construction works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass of glass , where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work on paper .
in addition , first fish and cr@@ abs have to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ stadt and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher outskirts , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked .
the cost of the three Brü@@ ck@@ ani@@ ans is a total of 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it does not happen so often that parties are pulling in a job , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D is in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell on the loud poster &quot; big electoral campa@@ igning . &quot;
and well @-@ known names on the start - like Alice Fem@@ ale , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top @-@ chief of the Bundest@@ ags in the 24th of September , is the deputy president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authorit@@ ative organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; anc@@ estral potato salad , which could eat also the Af@@ D , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police brought many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D really come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes were reported by the Af@@ D volcano ei@@ ph@@ ur , he tries to try such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built foli@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes do not exist enough parking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners waiting for the chief can@@ did@@ atin for the Bundest@@ ags @-@ election , Alice Fem@@ del , and the deputy president Beatri@@ x by Stor@@ ch .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the footh@@ ills have a longer breathing , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can decrease - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a return with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ched Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ group@@ ed tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the clo@@ ak bag .
together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he presents a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea on Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ ans &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in bladder music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and a pri@@ ze@@ winner of numerous international competitions and have won Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orches@@ tras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t is the SW@@ R Symph@@ on@@ ie@@ Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World music &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ ant , mix classic , jazz and the free playing to an intrigu@@ ing artwork . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was only presented this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ath has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ ir@@ che with their particular acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately included into the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Stewart completely openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I once lived in gri@@ lled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh this was cool , what comes next &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of the wood @-@ wood@@ stars was the one to her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , which ultimately fell bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ ar against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kr@@ isten gave to her that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
I just liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time when they rather like a book , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really got me seriously .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a book .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to do a certain way and upset me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me some un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like it to be justified in front of the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a major announcement at West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endorse the Democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes establishes that he owns coal mining in five states , and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday night gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democr@@ at party , who would go rather than working to do our country again . &quot;
&quot; with just 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without a guidance and unable to find a positive , puri@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised by Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be added again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s L@@ eich@@ ern@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress at the eve of the athle@@ tics world championship that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were blown away with competitions , gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was voted on maintaining the ban , which has been imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) clu@@ es on the state @-@ of @-@ subsidi@@ zed D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised himself in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added
nine Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics world championship which will start on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
Dro@@ gent@@ tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers still be free , &quot; said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries for in Mali canc@@ eled soldiers
at a funeral party in nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter crash in Mali revers@@ ed soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral town under high security measures .
to still un@@ resolved abor@@ tions , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two reverse drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bel@@ lows ourselves before this highest victim , which they did in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday of a week in the West African Mali .
their sc@@ iss@@ ors were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ ger of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Saint Peter .
at the mid@@ day , only the relatives were at the church farewell .
then the funeral party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
Trau@@ t@@ ant@@ y laid ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the S@@ är@@ gen .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defensive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Le@@ yen signed the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and were filled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ mann had built the flight @-@ operation of the batt@@ h@@ ub@@ bu@@ d tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with one of the first six educated tigers of his regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , there would be none . &quot;
Zweifel at the UN Mission in Mali presented the Minister for Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the s@@ uns@@ ha@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife

the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was further written in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik buried , be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home .
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would become king .
in 2016 he went into the retirement and also sets the title &quot; Prince ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Ballet by , the Chief of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ race , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Thames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people had always f@@ aded , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 years .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did critic@@ ised .
my D@@ än@@ isch was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ aps instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation in which they had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for reflection .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were the same two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to make a quick new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low @-@ source Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governmental majority for a swift re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green parliament@@ arians from their country @-@ demand in Lower Saxony had plung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens &apos; MP El@@ ke T@@ MC founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its election district in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to absorb them .
with that CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to date , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new landing day is elected regul@@ ary on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could be ruling in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable for the landing stage as quickly as its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the provincial version also provides the possibility that the landing stage draws the trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be insp@@ ected legally and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called a twist step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something recur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politician himself emphasized : &quot; I am no tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she was referred to as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the cancelled parliament@@ arians to return to their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course going to assume that she has received her Land@@ tag@@ and@@ at that she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the state @-@ of Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we strongly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot trace this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or@@ ate Martin Schulz condemned the over@@ flow of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ itt Tw@@ enty costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony by the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in her frustration , her personal interests in front of the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ sachsen of this dirty in@@ tri@@ logy and tries to strike political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tual CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to take in the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the election election in 2013 .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force , the SPD and the Green Party in the country day , but a hau@@ gh@@ thin majority had a vote of one voice .
agricultural Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves against g@@ f@@ ists , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect from toxic eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look exactly on eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will receive the latest information on the Eg@@ gs involved in each case .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ tened by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and is located since the announcement of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are non @-@ efficient and in@@ efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if in case of eggs the pay@@ load content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is not allowed , these are non @-@ traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the operations are to blame .
do production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?
the production of production is not an immediate fault .
rather , due to mut@@ in@@ humane practices of services , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to mut@@ in@@ humane practices .
as always there is in the seriousness of too little controversy .
is there only at the staff or also on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such action and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may exist , of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already clearly stated several times that I expect a seamless explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system at food patches really necessary ?
consumer rights and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and traffic @-@ made foods .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumer rights and consumers are rightly revol@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the pan@@ ed means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that absolutely does not need . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be consistent at all levels and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the fact that the atomic fact is raised in fast and un@@ brid@@ geable .
how the financial transactions of the Football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent unfor@@ ese@@ en expenses of European football , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world ch@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that the European game has supervised the power , cre@@ ws of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean PS@@ G to point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Moving to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money loose , with that ne@@ ym@@ ar under@@ writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy of the wealthy ruler of Qatar .
associations may apply for a lot of money to acquire players , but have to be controlled with legitimate sources , which enable them to provide a break @-@ on point in their on the football business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had put tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to a tougher matter .
while the current three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ year period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini was fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red of excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we are determined by the rules for the future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year deal , so that the cancellation policies can be postponed for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ mart their financial supervision by entering their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ cher company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard market rates should exceed , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A ruled that the value of the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ing took place from the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to ne@@ ym@@ ar about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup Ambassador will be and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could simply figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be enligh@@ tened to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated net sales of 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year need to be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship @-@ de@@ as , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League has been clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s way@@ point by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to the latter &apos;s ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ke Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State which is financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play because you can create different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ver
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has made chocolate for Swiss .
now the mutual collaboration is ahead of a possible end : the airline writes the order new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the News Agency SD@@ A , a corresponding report on the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will release a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
about 17 million small red s@@ wee@@ ds spread over 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
at the expense of the costs , Swiss does not want to make any information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ sider value the order volume in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; northwest Swiss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achie@@ ves annual sales of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a cabinet maker , it is a prestigious job .
how many applicants can do it in the new committees , the Swiss does not want to reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty over the spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate plates spread out the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss a contract ended with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was built in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long hau@@ l flights , customers of the First Class with treats are spoiled by the Con@@ conf@@ erie jumps , in the Business Class bags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short track distributed Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ g@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge @-@ com@@ edy , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ ar@@ te@@ facts , it is also a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking d@@ ose vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ ff@@ ing themselves on the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ middle ages play s@@ lugg@@ ish children who grow up - nevertheless , they made the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the jo@@ kes .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with its adults , who now play adults , is less emotional @-@ rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy is more deeply rooted , among them a riff on the stal@@ lion movies of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand , which looked at the cradle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at a point browse a character with an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Rom@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ignant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the Ex@@ courses are the best part of the franchise .
it is especially great fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ das of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments of accidental madness that could cure this franchise , like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist Years later , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang as they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminis@@ cent of a different type of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags to see ( the police spend the time to look at chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speaker - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer which carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often as a single one .
with six long episodes it turns away and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been re@@ acted to a lower length , since Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f again and again visit the American Embassy , whose Lobby is always occupied by two thick men who have been occupied by a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the convic@@ ted communist audience is that Western culture can make it all food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs and ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , like the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 sec@@ ul@@ ances were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 , and have already issued arrest warran@@ t against this arrest warran@@ t .
moreover , the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians , there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
an action was involved in the Italian and Bav@@ arian Inves@@ tig@@ ators .
overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Mafia being organised by organised drug @-@ crimin@@ ality , severe violence , trials , and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
in the summer of 2016 , the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office has been established against organised drug trafficking in the southern German area .
between the prosec@@ utor in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an inspir@@ ational exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
into the visor of the investigations , the Italian national with a close relationship with the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , at the early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account .
ways laments large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who do not appear there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner in Germany has significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious failures in asylum procedures .
the authorised for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen &apos;s way , has made notice of a media report on large gaps in the country @-@ country register .
def@@ ici@@ encies in the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis that is the &quot; Southern German newspaper . &quot;
according to the Register , 10 million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entry can be significantly slow@@ ing down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; those EU citizens are captured , who would not even have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has obviously started to return to Italy to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it highlights the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that BAM@@ F lead to such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper had a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the travelling country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to reason you write the Office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recep@@ tive capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy have substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for admission and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would also send back refugees within the framework of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political spokes@@ person of the link &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful recording conditions and a haz@@ ard to the child of child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation led the spec@@ ulations over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain when they held the interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members an increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened for an increase .
in its fourth annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on fiscal income would continue , whereby inflation in the autumn is likely to rise to just below 3 % .
but they sign@@ aled that in the next few years Zin@@ c would be necessary to breed the inflation of the Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may need to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut recovery , which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time for finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting next February , although it is expected that they will make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the Real@@ income of households remains exposed to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeti@@ tive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain criminal of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be required than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the projected growth forecasts .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound was based on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent disappointing growth has increased the rising expectations on a zinc increase , and GDP in the second quarter increased by 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor pay@@ outs , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before they get repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound weight , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption spending .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the act .
the Bank appreci@@ ates that it will likely take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
before the last judgment of the bank on interest rates , the call for a Zin@@ c increase was increased , since inflation has increased pressure on hard sup@@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July increase an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has declined last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent return of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders would like to search many shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages fin@@ es , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to rub a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transforming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV infection treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ approved pre @-@ risk prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection from around 86 percent , now by health service on a first three @-@ year study , for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after having confirmed the Court of Justice last year a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice for which N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP , despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess magazine announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first that will allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in the whole of England .
predic@@ tive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV compounds which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infection @-@ endangered .
taking Pr@@ EP before intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or as already two hours before intercourse .
to those who come for treatment in question include s@@ ule or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a doctor &apos;s doctor , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicines during this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected and implemented in a large scale , as it is implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to reduce HIV prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk admission to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt to develop in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ Medicine had been safegu@@ ar@@ ded , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delay and hesit@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can finish the transmission of this viable infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to ending the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living life : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment turned into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square meters of large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with an equipped layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose they commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ each other , so the architectural challenge consisted of creating a me@@ zz@@ anine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to resolve the submission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were st@@ acked over , without we had to decorate them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine looks a classic cl@@ assy window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down on the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make him seem longer .
the kitchen feels the mirror like a window into another room .
at the entrance offer mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all cut@@ ters and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went into &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so when you push the door , very easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne has gained additional 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculation a calculation based on the bottom @-@ size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love yourself into the electric plu@@ ck of the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of slightly default in something very astonishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar capital
two brothers are located four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty , in an analysis of one of the biggest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers met 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - from Paul as the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a jurisdiction states that Col@@ in is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash turned out to be out for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the votes proposed by Col@@ in proposed have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but raises Paul prior to managing some possessions .
in an early affair , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , by hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports by companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including all My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firm law .
MS De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the col@@ ling@@ wood property , opened in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid up to 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very well , although he was a former AF@@ L Executive Board , and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case before the courts be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to kill myself and to draw our surname thanks to the dishes , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I would be in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hopes for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday the hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ umps of new leader is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new leader of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more like course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , the new leader of the White House , at his first working day , he set up a main problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that would fall into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media company .
President Tr@@ umps relationship to TV goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ isions still is strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February toward Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter &apos;s habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridiculous .
perhaps these war@@ like officials know something that we didn &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets do not have any more ig@@ ni@@ tion .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets who has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff have created it for several times to keep away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented it , that tr@@ ump controversi@@ es emerge .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house that unites themselves from competing parties , repeatedly try to move its own agenda by promoting trac@@ ting material that may be promoting their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons , doub@@ tful information .
this was an example that was described by repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ official say that tr@@ ump as a volcano may respond to negative press sections , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he will try to figure out where these originate .
just that happened at the end of February , when somebody was accused of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy rod of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ ak in the White House .
although Johnson was banned because of Schi@@ kan@@ en permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false evidence in the past and vo@@ ke her in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump las the article and started to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then leader Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that folded ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and its consultants still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ cov@@ eted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the assistance of the population will pray and hoped .
the police across Europe send post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ sought @-@ criminal off@@ ences are not known in accordance with the people , they will be hoped and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Christmas calendar from the winter .
the experiences have shown that many ban@@ ces of holiday destinations also hide it was by Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards have assembled 21 post@@ cards for B@@ ased criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ our , more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online gestures could not be arrested until now , at least 11 of them based on references following the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some compensated travelers who have negotiated a field in front of the community in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought back horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were only thrown out in May , without being de@@ ported by one of the Council to prevent gra@@ vation .
the tactical group found a gap in the defensive systems and expressed their vehicles through a section which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous town said , &quot; They have gone there on Monday , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were in May there , were further moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle long submission instructions in order to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my com@@ plac@@ ings when the Council can not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who did not want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to pl@@ under@@ ed from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in a parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an speaker at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country side of the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to make it as fast as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our prob@@ ing collection , it is very important that as many residents report a anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ ke 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the judgment must prove when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambience farm company will be lost approximately 30 000 nights per year and also recei@@ pts from the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic figures of refugees who were located in the county district , the hotel building was offered as a collection of accommodation , which was a controversial discussion .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the installation of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not disputed at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts of the colon@@ ists , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ das with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
the hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovation work will be done .
the so@@ ils were cut out , blankets to the part built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area is converted , there are new windows built @-@ in .
everything was later &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
it would not position itself at the high level of hotels in foli@@ age @-@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourist Board Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior facilities are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that is open to the restaurant , which is publicly available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ key : U.S. special @-@ special Jury consists Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Representative Robert Mu@@ eller to report a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the committee recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to the subject trusted persons .
the newspaper em@@ med the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expands and intensified his investigation .
the radio station CN@@ N reported , there are already the first inv@@ itations of the body in connection with a meeting between a tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin for a longer time to mixed up in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines , whether there were agreements between a tr@@ umps team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand up in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment among the L@@ upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special won Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally have moved into the center and looking forward to whether the president also impe@@ de the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine and decide this evidence in possible re@@ fr@@ actions to decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Jury &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are therefore also called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buy @-@ chambers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly they are switched on when it concerns bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor to re@@ charge people for hearing under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , already pre @-@ lad@@ ders were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also a tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ iger election manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
right @-@ wing had said on Thursday evening in the US TV , that the installation shows that Mu@@ eller won &apos;t be shy at his job and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the suspension of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday night spoke a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he does not know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advocate any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey told three times that not be determined against the President .
there is no reason to accept that something changed , it was in the explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of this run@@ time , accus@@ ations were loud against p@@ umping , he did not want to h@@ amp@@ er the judiciary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him for an adjustment of the investigations against former National Security Consultants Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of its investigation .
according to the presentation of U.S. media , White House has gathered material against special agents and its employees .
the sol@@ uble spec@@ ulations of whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent Special Representative of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the later backward President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller added a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Justice Department .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators were dis@@ mis@@ ed on Thursday , after which the special requests could not be released as easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger for people from him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , is unclear is unclear .
in total , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
now the broken pist@@ on was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
scar@@ let flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow in the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this swe@@ ep was the balance of wax and abor@@ ting a few years ago .
a full swing is there , AW@@ I researcher writes by Daniela Jan@@ sen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am talking about the fact that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ is is in danger , for the pret@@ end have never been withdrawn as far as currently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the ice @-@ plate is standing under tension and can fall in case of a key point out a piece of dro@@ che .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase the sea level , since they swim on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it results in the melting itself .
however , the loss of the swe@@ ep leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in proportion , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I @-@ data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the four @-@ largest ho@@ fe@@ fe@@ i of the Antarc@@ tica .
at the end from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks off .
&quot; although there is a natural action and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the far retreat since the start of the record &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists may be disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now will grow back or over long , and possibly f@@ lowed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher did not return to climate change , this gigantic ice r@@ ump will not fall back to climate change , so in the last decades there are very many ice @-@ tuft of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
this long finish of Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have been around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus counted among the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants bon@@ star@@ if at the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls to enter from the workplace , to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Krem@@ lin opened 41 new positions in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the roundabout in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now there are 17 appren@@ tices after their first working day .
the courses of the circle are obviously very popular .
about 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lacks the staff to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks .
at present there are at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann , still 50 not occupied .
among other things , doctors and engineers are sought and forces of the general administration .
in Kre@@ ist@@ ag , the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work out on the request of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs at specialist professionals , but forward @-@ looking forward @-@ oriented of applicants , is called it .
the overall concept should focus on inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational offensive , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems that one has not known before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do so , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditioned comes out of the ministry .
so high time for action to do so , so that no more positions will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he had long ago been in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he presented the human resource @-@ cover public in question and the other parties were start@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want to be reviewed all the possibilities which allow the ex@@ iting from the municipal employer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the Kreis@@ administration with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the members of the county , should strive for a Hau@@ star@@ if , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U attempts to pay the employees and officials better than the tari@@ at for the public service actually fores@@ ees .
sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases , or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level which is oriented at work years .
however , the tasks of the circle are growing more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , land@@ board Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tor Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to NGOs @-@ migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given NGOs , the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue , if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ aret &apos;s warning arrived a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ t &apos; because their crew worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has been in operation only for one year , it refused to express in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian government of Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that at the moment we are unable to operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after all information collected and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ t &apos; , the Iu@@ v@@ enta , since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is believed that his crew are delivered to din@@ gh@@ y migrants that can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers and that the s@@ mug@@ gler can be used so that ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one such coincidence was alleged to take place only 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the ashes of the prosec@@ utor , whose content has been published by Italian media .
the occupation is susp@@ ects that the authority of the Italian coastal guard , supervis@@ es rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Conduct , boats like the Iu@@ v@@ enta must have a Italian police officer on board their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS of Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their life@@ times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy following the rescue measures in Italy , over the past few weeks , sug@@ gesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with the local citizens have borne fruits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens during this month , about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali via measures to reduce the number of migrants that leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate , to enjoy four days long Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz Forest and the vor@@ ed levels .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ lo@@ oms .
on the second day , we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim on the Sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ age market .
again the view point at the lookout spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days many altitude metres were told .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and rever@@ ts brought welcome breaks .

after 17@@ 3 kilometers and nearly 4@@ 500 metres , the group had known the Pf@@ alz forest of its best - sporty and culturally .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
are the Sport @-@ stars in the future be in front of computer consoles , rather than going through wind and weather over the stadium .
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gases .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ das which are increasingly engaging in this area .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , launched in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department founded and two professionals for the computer game of FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to get a whole new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said President Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on these train still few associations rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the next weekend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized in London the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which gam@@ ers compete for various clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , such example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the electric sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football needs to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the associations tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian .
prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract may be present online by far more often on these markets than only once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or just the soccer simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as in normal sport , Li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in the Asi@@ en@@ play 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is safe to be ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ ach@@ ous has long been faced with the issue .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical responses that you can also find in classical sport - such as increased heart frequencies , stress @-@ reactions , hormonal changes .
besides , there need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise their body on the console , but also take care of their body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous does also look at problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult at online gambling , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ Sports .
players are on the way internationally , this is like a large global family , there is no intercultural obstacles .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband der Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , in Germany , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be at 130 million .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors .
international are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez are taking part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton &apos;s carri@@ ages are investing in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ rac@@ ist Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports had been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer @-@ first League , according to Dut@@ t is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the ancient times are clearing out , it is no longer sufficient .
it is about maintaining the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align it on the modern market .
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you cannot stick to that only when football remains the same as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy , to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend by lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were suspended at local currency .
Carter was condemned in June because of the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is inno@@ cent .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red pants and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down facing eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not shown any revisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horrible circumstance that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not find out that you have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I mour@@ n &apos;t the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we shall bear with us for eternity to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pursued by the realization &quot; that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or she would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person to have with which I was together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call another , su@@ icide , su@@ ic@@ ide@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to himself , having revealed text releases , that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging you on the Spring of a building , I do not know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turning the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought to pay attention through the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that they would benefit from the event by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to Italy because of murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run during the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season to - extra motivation hur@@ ts out there .
something was different from his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the extra garments was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups naturally no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made himself the divided bin@@ der on the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ Captain .
good , the entry would have better run than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could indicate that I also indicate .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was in fact chosen by youth play@@ ers , de@@ af@@ ers and just from the holiday @-@ made professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he .
Zucker@@ l is one of the most ad@@ orable to those who wish to wear a lot , which one wants to keep in mood .
so who was chosen to compete the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
to the right back , this is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me participated in this starting formation like the one who can take the rest in the hand even at the best .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole while many others were busy themselves .
V@@ idal thus to play its missing fitness ( fol@@ dable little ) ; Renato San@@ ches with that , on devil come out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s jer@@ sey .
this is all quite good .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both ag@@ ded sovereign .
the well @-@ appointed Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , moreover , South @-@ building tried to succeed a few times even in the game building .
his colleague Ru@@ dy has indeed been that the result was &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed at the debut a decent performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play shift , Tem@@ po@@ on : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I got fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ accustomed to this Bavaria &apos;s world , nor for the new arri@@ vals , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but intended six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ myself said after a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from South Korea : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you just need to win any game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new ones any more .

company satisfied with rh@@ et@@ land pf@@ alz Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ don pace
it often has been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected after more than a year in which the new economic Minister Volker T@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and re@@ alising the old prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing is attacking the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around now sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the mosquito @-@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the primary list of the country now at the top .
yet this year the Ministry hopes to be hoping for a plan to plan up to 2021 the building is supposed to stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans is also playing the west @-@ in Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need of the federal traffic plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ president said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to for@@ bid or limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ ogens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the automobile manufacturers , equipment for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles , must also install , take also what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices to comply with emissions if a car has been tested , but res@@ train in normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted by Volkswagen in the United States , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be put to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe and a request that focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be heavy : the luxury car manufacturer also contributes to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
the Is@@ ar visitor also takes part in the Is@@ ar visitor , drives a raft through Munich on tomorrow &apos;s morning , which has a special message .

and this is no nasty float , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Bau@@ refer@@ at wants to clear up .
on the float one sees a big info @-@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a trash .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective cover is raising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even last summer , the raft across Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Cr@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the best @-@ published carto@@ ons carto@@ on@@ ists , the cel@@ eri@@ ans of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film .
his message : laugh , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a dra@@ wer for Happy cards by - what makes him fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s the breakthrough : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
over and over again the artists of cities are inspired .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the sch@@ ist tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting in the drawing , according to the drawing , works almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches are still finding a lot of spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ ed as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the movie screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he sets more on the TV series , which , as its original labels , which is produced .
laven@@ der from Provence threatens climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the laven@@ der is due to the due to dro@@ ught conditions and because of the disease @-@ borne insects dimin@@ ishing , leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agro@@ Research Institute in Provence , said : &quot; the laven@@ der in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the last few years , which has brought much less rain in spring and in autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of laven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ic@@ ans , and with very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
laven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less pieces with essential oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the ground , but also the b@@ ump of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drying .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Nep@@ alese ru@@ den@@ um celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the point @-@ point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval .
cro@@ ws , c@@ ach@@ ers , traders , vag@@ aries , or a land la@@ undering are to be experienced on these days in the city center .
the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil and ce@@ as@@ eless drugs wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or leave them at home in 2009 .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal .
there are drugs s@@ mug@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are susp@@ ects on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no relaxing break from the violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to in December 2012 took office . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under federal protection , and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter you find a publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs .
its absence will be felt deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his Middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging at the facade of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and re@@ porter discuss about their shared themes , the trauma , its nightmare , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was a Son@@ der Federal Reserve established in 2010 , in order to edit the cases of journalists , this was initiated by the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year connected with drug trafficking and organised crime , the murder@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist that the violence of s@@ alo@@ a is to be treated , although they are insignificant and even though the terrain is now even worse .
without information on the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this Workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot to him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve @-@ fold river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius was driving in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to travel freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival@@ ing fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of sold , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ en for drug roy@@ alty , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a condition of &quot; peace &quot; if only one cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug commerce in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understandings into the murder have contributed .
first of all , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues reported that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it impossible to run journalism without going to the ro@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and turnover and advertising took .
journalists loved it to be able to publish hard apt studies without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else had to treat .
eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Commit@@ tees to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever they did .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ pl@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what happened ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ckers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ an@@ abo , the bar towards the office , and always sit on the same table .
now she ask : was his love for the routine of his pit ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their c@@ anny and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it &apos;s wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &apos; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , are no longer considered as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside sought out two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who spoke the governor themselves as not trustworthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went into the mountain landscape , where drugs ban@@ kers are facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has li@@ cked to three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former renowned box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the town of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local manufacturer of drug addic@@ ts and authorities .
a re@@ porter was recorded from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a poli@@ ers who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled nearly all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ fle@@ dged cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months before , the reader had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that are dedicated to the kill@@ ings of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ au@@ te a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez has been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have become stronger by em@@ itting the &quot; SOS Press &quot; in the organised protest &quot; SOS Press &quot; on sal@@ aries and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez accused R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and bring them out , because they said the truth .
she has since asked her that she has been re @-@ divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , were involved in the governmental officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drugs ban@@ kers , but also on the command of politicians and security guards held with the organised crime among a blan@@ ket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Media W@@ äch@@ ler Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned to more than half of the attacks on journalists by the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to dis@@ rupt the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the Blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer ta@@ st@@ ur and headphones around their separated head .
some stores have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug industry with an editorial page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who keep returning and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once said to be po@@ ets , gives him that drug stores scar@@ es him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer , than once all of their phones started .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ enri@@ v@@ als and security guards near the bathing area Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the boarding stone edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page has to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ls nearby - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they showed it not .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle @-@ finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just remember &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the same day when Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain work were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even find that his love of red@@ dish @-@ like Braun was - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ received dinosau@@ rs that has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years .
his unbelie@@ v@@ ably well preserv@@ ative condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserv@@ atives and Fossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the board , and decided to see more accurately .
that was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground@@ breaking .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be unveiled .
&quot; if you only b@@ bed a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the science story as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably by meat fres@@ hen dinosau@@ rs .
the strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ar@@ ation technology that is known as a counter@@ feit one , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say expert , which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature made of the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier did in May for the first time and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli under the Museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours making it carefully .
the ast@@ ounding maintenance of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ gra@@ dations , a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ lubric@@ ation is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it points out that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat eating dinosau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ours the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use counter @-@ gra@@ dations - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or g@@ utter animals - are much smaller and hur@@ tful than prey , which sign@@ aled that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ ory @-@ animal behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs of the chal@@ k had been to be , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was red .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his conc@@ entri@@ c Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ ted to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea where it sank on the back to the sea .
at this time Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ stru@@ ed g@@ ly skin , but it remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe he is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , as a huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ us@@ hing dinosau@@ rs , who were on two legs .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ang@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ maintained dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 inch @-@ long peaks , which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was sh@@ iel@@ ded by Western Canada until a flooded river is floo@@ ding into the open sea .
but the underwater appearance of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy arm@@ oured plates along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the better it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rests of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy arm@@ or plates that carry the skull of the beast .
its pure front @-@ foot is lying on its side , his five fingers are split up .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many injured
fierce accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , mile @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday morning at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age , about 20 people have been injured .
according to the police , according to the police officers were between the connection between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
on the exact number of publishers , first of all , no information before .
it is easy to moderate injury , said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ prec@@ cher .
a large host of li@@ b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident point .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in direction Munich .
in the driving of Munich we formed a roughly ten kilometres long retreat .
as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ters reports , it also came on the tra@@ ject@@ ory to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade wrote down the characters of the vehicle glasses , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate sanctions .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. it occurred a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
thereby there was a collision between a car otran@@ spor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident point .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ es &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creative man and w@@ akes up an un@@ wind or irrit@@ ates the ri@@ ver@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
driving card control .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn AG currently tests the creator @-@ free ticket control .
one simply confirms his mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ing the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer we expand it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an Bahn spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the railways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Navigation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Schaff@@ hausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use this , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket booked - what already do most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the railways of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the easiest type of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : you rise in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the test customers then a button will appear on the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train guide will receive a message on their mobile devices , that Dri@@ g@@ ast X has been in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
comes the traction leader in the driving card control of square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already app@@ end@@ ous online ticket .
so you can still sleep , keep on silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who relaxed without ticket control through our train@@ ee staff , check in the DB navig@@ ator simply itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often runs rail , knows that apart from delays and pass@@ est , the ticket checks can be considered to be the biggest nu@@ ances .
for often , one does not have the documents in any case , but one of the competitors does not take all the documents that you need to establish online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document is missing .
the result are endless discussions between train@@ ee and chassis , leading to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and take care of the creations at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
you can use only a small number of test customers to use the new service .
and this also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same route are not yet activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken until its core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ wil@@ dered , because no one else had posted the information on her fen@@ ed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly re@@ trac@@ eable on their Tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper out of the territory of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , live to T@@ wee@@ ten .
he continued a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ blo@@ ous body that was stretched on the road and staying there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field drive .
there were photos of the police band and people who shou@@ ted , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live fe@@ ed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an stood before a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another poli@@ cem@@ an his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Fer@@ rell at her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder which we have used to ourselves and which we can name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ashamed .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided to drive the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in cinemas from the 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a history of surviving and Protest@@ ants , love and loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to challenge answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times in this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go back to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her with , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and it will see and be raised .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also to know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally have not experienced e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would show you a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ area , when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared hand@@ bags before and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said to her and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to document it or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ itted by their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , who is known for his activ@@ ism to To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsers .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; he said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on fer@@ ential experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious story in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as they fell in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the mer@@ ging of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s history repeatedly repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager of Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ ical &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we fight constantly on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is kept alive by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because with a life on these crosses , a black , squ@@ ule woman is so much at stake .
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the rac@@ ian connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ade of a highway during a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the social policy of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet they cling to a singing and she feels bound to this memory since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers are discussing bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South @-@ east of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold lets the subject hardly be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folk and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed the topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be real class &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ ts ) or simply simple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Me@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the prop@@ onents have to build that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , of which also the rest of the shops will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian area .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s hall is standing in 13 direct market @-@ marketed their products .
with the beginning of construction work will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - and to the Be@@ da @-@ Platz , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been purchasing almost weekly at the farm@@ hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm will always be very happy .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to see that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether there is direct market market in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are being empty here - some have been here for months and years .
as there is not yet another weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least receive the market hall .
after all , the goods offered are fresh , mainly directly from the producers are offered and is ob@@ end@@ lessly inexpensive .
as you see , shop shops are located in a shopping center only of larger firms , because the dor@@ sal rents are often not viable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special shops is almost no more and what still is left , will probably also disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ als : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery is not suitable for Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it manage to distribute the Ges@@ pen@@ st bit gallery before , all the shops of Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not going to work .
and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a right farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market hall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is made , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which hang almost in@@ strange - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fers and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret services analy@@ st failed to serve a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after they were made public @-@ fed diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and a pioneering discourse whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and could look out of the 30 portraits , even if some intellectual comment may not only be interpreted about the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways as it can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ary determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked openly since her pu@@ ber@@ ty about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations against the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ der , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ine blonde per@@ ils has been associated with which it was associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
it produced the artist portrait of strangers from for@@ en@@ ian arti@@ facts like cigarette @-@ mu@@ mel and che@@ wing g@@ um by extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper mag@@ azin .
&quot; they made an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press release of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ nate M@@ use were inter@@ rog@@ ated with unequal letters , which were ex@@ chan@@ ts in the course of two years .
they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Support Images &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ ian verdict would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release was asked for seven brutal years in a military @-@ war in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et ways that he actually should fix , continue to infl@@ ame .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery written down , Mann@@ ing called with her super@@ large signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , breed , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ ochon@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is a thou@@ sand@@ al of Cs and Gs and As , in pen@@ cil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific dictionary on the artist ) , as amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a release pre@@ acher in hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ kas@@ bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they ask your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get goo@@ se@@ ful when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pres@@ cient in the Com@@ ic@@ buch , but if they should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ars that unite like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ins have been written with pen@@ cil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide man hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who had been sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly violations .

La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ed , Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ them@@ them@@ them@@ atic now has been excluded from the subject of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the U.S. investigations in any imagin@@ able manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want he imagined .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects strongly to address the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ led tip , who said that in apartment 10@@ 08 , something happened .
the police described the scene as a very cruel one .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will finish the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap in the near future &quot; - Russian vi@@ vi@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ AD@@ A ) are implemented .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ AD@@ A has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada Roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada on the observ@@ ance of the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ installation of R@@ US@@ AD@@ A and recently published on the organization of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he contains nothing that could concern Russia &apos;s cause .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported findings of the W@@ ada investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to state @-@ made dop@@ ing in Russian sport publicly .
in relation to the matter Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation into an error because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
mut@@ ate words voted with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
talking to the Russian sales place R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems to the past in the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ AD@@ A was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , the R@@ US@@ AD@@ A explained &quot; in the right direction , &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di has not sold any eggs anymore
this shared the corporate groups .
it is a pure precaution , it could further be considered by no health draw@@ backs , it was in the message .
from now on , only eggs are to be supplied to Al@@ di which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ unci@@ ated anti @-@ runners .
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency to his customers .
the start @-@ ups which will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ re@@ tt wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers mour@@ n the process not .
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ re@@ tt , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce H@@ air Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee commitment , it allows companies to initiate surveys , speci@@ alistic groups and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to byp@@ ass the C @-@ Suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools from companies is used to measure employees .
Er@@ re@@ tt said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and pol@@ ls from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which executives may have low commitments results - so that you can drill , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to remain involved in order not to be the next U@@ ber , which has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which describes a blog post office , which has been an environment of off@@ ences , for those who have spoken , punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth 2020 according to the finance technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize an asc@@ ending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent allows companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and watch the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the judgment of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that its employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , there may be costly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers &apos; flu@@ tu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has already been used for more than one year to ensure that staff are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , since the company conver@@ ts up the company , the problems previously sat by managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ smar@@ ter practic@@ e- faster and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree viewpoint into the experience with employment , &quot; Vit@@ rano that direc@@ ts the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and employee involvement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen is collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ic violations through the En@@ ron sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent provide your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
it won $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , then they feel more committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies are well running . companies are well running when employees work and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you can find assistance .
the data about the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a business does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the shift does not come quickly enough or not at all , it can breed any dis@@ appointments and dec@@ ep@@ le .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely heavily on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really belong to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now manages monthly workers surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ re@@ tt .
and following collecting feedback from frustrated staff , she was able to organise and add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ges
it is at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint is on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ kot@@ ar parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good portion of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final audi@@ ts before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ arius Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real tre@@ ad@@ mill for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load load and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the already packed schedules of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ time in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to stop in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal toys for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the control modification of N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have simply pushed it down , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices once the camp is termin@@ ated , considering the clear sight of its fields from an adjoining car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with foot@@ wear , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins @-@ players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then draw up an exercise .
if you have the video and from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false messages to fact audi@@ ted by third parties and then display their results under the original contribution then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine methods to identify possible fal@@ se@@ ers and to send them to fact audi@@ tor , which may display the results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main considerations for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , while the French elec@@ torate were flooded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan where social media networks are to be punished , if they did not manage to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to finding , which stories of fact audi@@ ted third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; in conjunction with the articles &quot; and works on other changes to his messages Fe@@ ed to decrease false messages .
creating a com@@ ic @-@ novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its comfortable seat at the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; I have only responded to the Dau@@ men@@ ace on the side of a letter that was written by a double car in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his sentence ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always cried to smoke , because at that time there is a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he even were there .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest &quot; ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed Hy@@ än@@ heads in walls and the bottles spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ es , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust got the full access only 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , ra@@ vel it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English post , cards which represent what possessed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You might think that rural conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have fought for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm up of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is represented in the 18th century , who filled his own funeral , by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was first made years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite well to be getting debt and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men extingu@@ ish their debt cr@@ aps by getting rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise ground@@ ing . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has got a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about pus Christi , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been demanded again by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the unvei@@ ling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday has started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the M@@ acher of the action for yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ d@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them to their released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in action to go more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is called further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said to form@@ ulate a sound@@ ing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Honnef for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military forms in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s fear of the army
each year in early August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ists and val@@ or@@ ings in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister .
at the discussions , under the presidency of the State , the five vi@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs was also part of the presidency .
in this way , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were dis@@ car@@ ded .
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdogan has fired at 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who also sees Erdogan as a wire but@@ ing of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who should immediately take part in the put@@ sch , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in the day after the coup , Erdogan had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to fully clean the Armed Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan the army really handle control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; discomfort in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
in general , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among other things manifes@@ ts itself in the lifting of the header ban for sol@@ dat@@ inside , wrote the newspaper .
the major income in the army and security guards is continuing at any rate .
in the middle of July Erdogan by decre@@ es further 73@@ 95 stat@@ ers , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
at the same time , Erdogan seemed that Erdogan is t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als g@@ old earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times , they post@@ ures them to their role as gu@@ ardian of the worldly state order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory , Erdogan is pressing the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers say Erdogan is targe@@ ting an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly @-@ called officer who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is too , such a development could not leave Nato .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , there is doubt in the alliance according to the pur@@ ports of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplomats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will get good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to add route for race at the race
over the past few months over the future of the race track has been denied and now it should go quite fast .
by the end of the year , on the mar@@ o@@ des track , on which the tourist railway is going to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race in the long term , after information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the road works will start in this year .
&quot; with the decision to order to order and san@@ e the route from Il@@ men@@ au race , the country knows itself to this especially important connection , &quot; stated by Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the maintenance of the distance he rose to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this sum , the land take 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ bay@@ ern Bahn as an owner have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the roadmap that used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race @-@ off @-@ shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the race @-@ off @-@ shuttle is a popular rail connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Rac@@ er .
in the course of a pilot &apos;s operation , it has been tested in the wake of a pilot plant whether the circuit is used enough for many people to order them in the future again .
the route is also very strong in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it
just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ed professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key said during the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ ir@@ ks have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silic@@ on skin , which feels warm to the touch - with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adjust its robots according to their beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is still more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would have a Step@@ ford @-@ woman to look progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as bulk soli@@ ds .
and then there is still the &quot; True &quot; ion xy gold robot with pre @-@ programmed celebrities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conv@@ eys the impression of sh@@ atter@@ ing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of true companion .
so you like what you like and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - really like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this climb from sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ stan@@ tive female characteristics , the ant@@ ations on rape , if one move a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : res@@ sing ) Far@@ rah is un@@ quiet one most .
on his website normal companion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &apos; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fairy or just just another sex toy .
their formation and their increasing sophistic@@ ation indicate somewhat darker and deeper into our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumption culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ed from the edge @-@ zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or offensive until the free market gives this permission for this .
there is however a certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ved to have women sexually attacked .
the most deter@@ red aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the inter@@ tw@@ isted body and the out@@ going eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great jump .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
other words : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ umps a great achievement ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy man .
it has become a bin@@ ders of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also families in the small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ te@@ thank@@ fully , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relative .
we all supposedly urge us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less notice has been to bring the power tr@@ umps to families .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet living in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows she knows , including Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the distorted effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gross@@ est way that one day does not encounter us any more .
however , there is a start@@ ling long @-@ term scenario , in which tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; that suddenly appear as a term of neg@@ ativity compared to its standards .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of forgetting - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we know how his tax return ) - which both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ acked and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and clim@@ atic music conv@@ eys this in strange manner .
so many stere@@ otypes of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not part of - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years go on it and all have a great time .
if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
at the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % tips from the same - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ prehen@@ sive while I made tired of having my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us from the prison to hospital
Pist@@ o@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of du@@ kes in his hospital , which he suffered the Pen@@ al authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ o@@ us was condemned to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors due to murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first total of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day , 2013 by hanging her several times by a door of the toilet cabinet in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pist@@ o@@ il@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to put this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ o@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they be too short @-@ sighted .
the National Criminal Agency said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ o@@ us is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer , Arnold was found a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quadru@@ pe@@ ds from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and into the leading schools .
three of the ent@@ ou@@ tra@@ ys in the future go to the college , four to the real school .
Schul@@ le@@ thal Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des are elected a young eagle , who is rising in the chicken yard , but still dis@@ missed in freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Adler in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold was found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken .
instead of a chicken morning a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread on a high mountain its wings , and swe@@ ar .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for the integration , said Schul@@ le@@ thal Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te .
the young is unlike the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ t@@ che@@ er that he felt in his new school .
it ensu@@ ed acceptance to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who is always jumping again at teaching g@@ un@@ cover , and the parent representatives .
the ch@@ icks is over now , declared class teachers Sophia Schumacher .
she leave her students after two years of lessons very much , because it was a really great time .
finally , she can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ s@@ ler .
at the end , all the students left a song of summer time and vacation time .
and with the children great joy broke out .
eight first@@ s@@ wis@@ ters have already registered for the new school year .

software update for diesel cars : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will diesel @-@ drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel @-@ summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the gas behaviour of cars of the emission classes 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by ACE car Club Europe provides coverage :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their re@@ armament has arranged the power station ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an excellent implementation in the coming months , but not yet have an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if any inspection is required , this will be completed within the frame .
how long should the conver@@ sions go in total ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the links from the engagement of manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE betra@@ ys for a wait .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would retreat , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions , where rider ha@@ ils .
in rural areas there is no value for older diesel until now .
the ACE betra@@ ys , with a sale still to be seen .
ll Cool J will receive Kennedy Center @-@ award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is given first p@@ apper , one of the cov@@ eted achievements of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ ographic in Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV @-@ producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be passed in early December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will arrange a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
the wor@@ ship@@ wre@@ ck Le@@ ar with progressive TV series is already announced already to rel@@ inqu@@ ish participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has chosen to neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and the deb@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their view .
the Kennedy @-@ Center according to the former President John F. Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural device in the U.S. capital .
among the earlier winners , Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life @-@ worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Urban Design , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the spot is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years is W@@ acker Urban Design .
and the work still makes him great fun as he gives in the press conversation .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he mir@@ ac@@ ulous that so far no application will fulfil the requirements specification .
the city is searching for an architect or engineer at the next time .
thus - considering the regular cancellation policy - still enough time for a review .
since Has@@ lach for the administrative community acts as sub @-@ law authority , the applicant has to pre@@ ach the applicant .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they cannot fill it out this way , the citizens would need to travel up to Off@@ enburg .
but bourgeois closeness to the city and itself is important , says W@@ acker that tells of a good working environment as well as a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated , the W@@ acker can look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life @-@ worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Low @-@ park @-@ park are around .
the Kin@@ esi@@ brücke between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium is still subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciate W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
well @-@ known be for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of great man@@ oeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gardening that might be quite flexible .
&quot; one can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green grounds will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
as the Old Town stands as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , what rein@@ forces &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the disman@@ tling region .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ tic@@ ulture ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and remain with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further design of the city .
if you wish to receive Roland W@@ acker , then , after information about the city of Has@@ lach is a complete study as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor with specialized architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and building components .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under construction and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , urban planning , administration of urban loung@@ es , municipal premises with building yard and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , as well as sub@@ marine rights , including memorial protection .
bicycle on lines cast : south @-@ track closed
according to police , the unknown perpetrators brought the blue bike from the railway track in the field of Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ boards .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight forwar@@ ding had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male servants and are looking for them since the night hours .
close to the scene were by witnesses a ros@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike riders have been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator had brought themselves into a great danger and endangered the train traffic .
apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ alen @-@ customers can also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south train line could be led without disabilities .
nearly ten person@@ ages were dropped by Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the remote traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not fall out , but they had a delay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of the tops had to be replaced .
ins@@ ulators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help you relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel )
rot@@ ten meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition , affected in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach absorption , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while sufferers are usually advised to relie@@ ve meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure harmful micro@@ bes that hide inside the body , not inv@@ ading the body .
cells , which are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues .
when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments was determined that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell on mice occurs , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition is tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel movement , if the same system is also ra@@ vel at people .
the Post@@ do@@ ktor@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a type of immune cell that promotes the tolerance , when she found that a group of study people had such cells but another group of the same tribe but separate , this did not have .
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were sequ@@ en@@ acted and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them out of mice .
mice were raised in a mortal environment so that they were missing a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers have to grow L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerant du@@ sting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 acid @-@ acid .
if researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells has been hal@@ ved by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant nur@@ turing cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i the cells in people develop as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;

the whole was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new underground for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , looked social @-@ democratic prime minister before elections always with some concern to Berlin .
only no interference from the Party central , merely no antagon@@ isms from the federal government - was so lau@@ ded the most important desire of the electoral champi@@ ons .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House are watching the events of the Willy Brandt @-@ House with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals .
what he received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach .
it was deep ass@@ aults .
and one by one after another .
the federal CD@@ U is looking after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is simply not reliably governed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fra@@ gment of a Green Party has plung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its red @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Belt leader Michael Kellner has asked the ab@@ rupt Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the over@@ step to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal Foreign Affairs and Elec@@ toral Committee of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must all not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ed a SPD electoral campaign than on Friday morning the new hi@@ obs@@ cur@@ ity reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands on the crossing of green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without their own ruling majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades of the time .
after the rural elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different .
that was then also - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smoothly .
the comrades took care of the comrades in the weeks after that .
then when they had just started new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next bottom .
Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country chief , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because he did so pretty much wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister had already been in criticism of the long term .
mi@@ ese conver@@ sions arrived .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the federal government in recent weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , was not conce@@ aled by Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him since they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could arise .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not a fault in the im@@ partial internal obligation of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Mr Schulz does not at all .
sometimes the comrades are trying to keep the own ranks closed .
their anger focuses on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the cancelled parliament@@ arians &apos; west .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and more democratic , like Ms T@@ jack@@ ets puts their own career entry over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party of Party in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
MS T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected because of her person as direct channel teaching , but was elected by the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische MP continues .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , laments a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD as a leading can@@ did@@ acy to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career thinking of a future CD@@ U @-@ MPs call the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to elu@@ ci@@ date the background .
I want to know if there was more or there had been further information from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to add to the years old house can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Municipal Development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler has once again been looking for a review of the previous events .
since 1991 there have been in delicate re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum .
the grant was still at 60 percent in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , not only to tap new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , we received the information of the government at the State University of Karlsruhe that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total amount will be EUR 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which EUR 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the church were sensitive .
how is the recovery area now ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether there is interest in the planned area to san@@ e .
if necessary , the district limits could then also be post@@ p@@ one another again .
the jet@@ ty spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the sanctions would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of domestic cities , improving living and employment relationships and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is made per property .
the re@@ establishment was finally determined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however until September this year , the inventory would only once again be carried out , within the framework of those who have received a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December it is intended to take place as the proposition which can be started with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann insisted that every commune must carry out the pre @-@ investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about to evaluate the urban planning of abnorm@@ alities and decide when sanc@@ tioned and to what extent .
it will then also be entered into the manual for the particular plot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to him again and will be able to see a picture of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which there is among other things about the construction state and refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can provide information about the size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; factory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be out only if in building business areas are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
furthermore , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog &apos;s principle - who first comes , ex@@ chan@@ ts first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no support for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ ors itself sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open its door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a towel movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between Th@@ umbs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House would cost tax@@ payers thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ el helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month , tax@@ payers are left up according to the data of the military , which were left to T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as marine One when the president is on board was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter in Connecticut made helicop@@ ters was issued next to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ fighter made of Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift truck from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to know that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 am at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 at this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew would be required for the flight back .
the original flight was found during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground .
from the records provided by T@@ IME , it was not clear whether the latter aircraft was required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits Federal Government , state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he dict@@ ated the efforts to compens@@ ate control rules .
the use of the airplane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
however , to request their use only for a photo @-@ op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February as the presidential plane in front of the background of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages dealing with the usage of the Presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ crew often lead training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn in order to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 Summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House 58 exercising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event had been in case of training demand for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers have not found the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ un@@ ent@@ ari@@ ums of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Er@@ equipment set for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Vir@@ an@@ tico .
the White House has argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs of tax@@ payers are based on the basis of estimates for the policy programme is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the revenue for DO@@ D do not include the personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract degrees .
at this time the former press review of the White House , Sean Sp@@ reads , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present those week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ reads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is reasonable to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ connected with the helicopter when he entered its round@@ trip over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire@@ fighters .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC @-@ BW Ne@@ uss in front of a tricky task
top @-@ rated of the Second Tennis Bundesliga performs at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ age Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel , at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ ental Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games ever more mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance sheet , the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality .
the team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability of the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , the imports from the far north are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strongly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ irs and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ orn hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there you need also a good serving happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxime jan@@ four .
at the moment the Challen@@ ger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not create the Bundesliga game , the tournament will come to the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c playful Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated Ch@@ il@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky even at the ATP @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ h Van de Z@@ and@@ owe , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z could return to the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was the number one of the junior list in January 2016 , not fill someone out of the train@@ ee by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump does not , when he dealt with his signature by the law on the intensi@@ fication of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast to en@@ act the law &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Congress have packaged a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even in Brussels the fo@@ aming against the US advance .
after all , the design fores@@ ees to pun@@ ish European enterprises that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
accordingly , investors from the domestic O@@ MV in collaboration with other European companies are co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East sou@@ l@@ ation North Stream 2 .
the d@@ se@@ cul@@ isse is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions even per executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him for the election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to which the group could rep@@ el and which could really we@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen@@ ware
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
strong contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ garten the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply to the urban children &apos;s facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy chief in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked in addition to house : a cat@@ erer is taking over this task and delivers freshly bo@@ iled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 children &apos;s premises , in 44 , the children get a warm meal .
in the past two year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need grows steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now not only children , the 45 week@@ days were taken care of , in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 2 p.m. CET . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants from 1 September kitchen service : they war@@ med the angel@@ fish dishes , they complement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ize the meal individually , give the food out , sink and clean the kitchen .
&quot; workers are firmly assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier for kit@@ ten to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy food and cooking .
&quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen@@ ware &apos;s team is there reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the aci@@ dity of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power even the charm that it has turned out in the cost between self @-@ regulated and foreign objec@@ tions for the city as the most economical means , it is from the press .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces will be newly set .
&quot; but these hours fall short of approximately 750 people in the education area not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ sh@@ om , acting Head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are di@@ ced at the elections in the provinces . three women are fighting for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have released threats against a choice , which coinci@@ des with the transition of international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time passed the power of a democratically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ sh@@ om said a strong role for women will still intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women of total recorded 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered .

GM@@ B concerns about investing in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make use of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was silent on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which poses other products hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that staff and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ite of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on , &quot; have to express concern that the financing for the modernization of production lines will not advance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of families have worked here and the workforce greatly concentrate on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are active as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , our business is constantly monitored - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ el location , especially in production lines and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy from T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , completely and completely . should our business processes change at the location , the staff and their trade union representatives shall be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated in their persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after a quotation of £ 18@@ 9 million , but have warned them fore@@ warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world empire ?
the sensational approach has f@@ lowed the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world ch@@ ord by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way out there , although a source located near the Catal@@ ans Board , although the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world three years ago from the PS@@ G President warned before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 is interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players in sign , so will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report ent@@ ail pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of the abuse of the Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal among the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ler , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated following the publication of the German press agency , he expects from the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Mu@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ous Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own sub@@ mis@@ sal or false evaluation of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that in the reporting on violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tw@@ o@@ fold measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; that would be punished and in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation &quot; said the author in Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the day @-@ to @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion which is normal for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis argued in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ hen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stro@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with children , as I was one was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often occurs .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he values the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the diocese in Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ ic@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with a high degree of emoti@@ onally the punishment for the students could also prove violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other def@@ endants that many victims were valued the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are even re@@ connecting with him . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann , why the final report on abuse sc@@ andal among the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger tells his opinion on his mind .
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
to a lift many students stand forth his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was handmade by the Ö@@ f@@ teren if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not received a top performance .
how do you evaluate this thesis as his bio@@ grapher ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you do the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he has just 8 pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of intermedi@@ ary or fellow @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool is also un@@ event@@ ful outside of its efficiency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can throw him if too late , or first contact is not taken seriously enough .
the building of the school for school , on which he worked , was felt by virtually all respondents considered - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents him an excellent record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledgeable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; knowledgeable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledgeable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely well @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who served the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ ing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and his high emotion@@ ality , which also already led to tan@@ tr@@ ums .
that he did not only cast down with chairs and threw the key@@ boards on the ground , but also ear @-@ cow@@ ard@@ ly shared and too fre@@ ak guys over the hair or ears , he has already given himself years ago , deeply de@@ pl@@ ored and apologi@@ zed for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , to his honor of salvation , however , must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widespread in the questionable time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us was born before 1968 .
also , I have experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what is actually written in this report , namely , the plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are the admittedly dre@@ am@@ ella .
you ask yourself if it &apos;s not to do with his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just moved on him .
on Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , are still eager .
the truth is , however , the report escaped George R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot about the topic of abuse with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen was reported in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report as well as any mis@@ conception or sympathy with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother to talk about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a mal@@ icious sign for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims were silent .
if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a be@@ asked student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insights and could have stayed the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that it is reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben inv@@ ha@@ unting or clearer or more rather likely to have as compared to their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ ts , instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any fellow @-@ knowledge .
thus , it cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was thrown out in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of them , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that is just a misuse of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asium of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report covers incidents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not an oral manager of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which boy of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were regul@@ ates and mal@@ igned , and among them were horri@@ fic on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they had already been on the Dom@@ ote@@ chni@@ cal for the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; heavenly &apos; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ ote@@ chni@@ cal for the school ?
Michael H@@ emann : there is indeed a discipline , but no sa@@ vi@@ cious violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims are appreciated the general humanity of R. , and in many cases even positive memories of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most still re@@ pro@@ ach to have had a look .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school which he had not worked and responsible , ( so a witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again to 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently merge the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ ote@@ chni@@ cs for the purpose of which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in that he points to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool continue to be practiced the test penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press conferences , he recommended urgent progress .
that of course was at a time when it was a legal clarity , when testing was forbidden in Bavaria too long .
before that , it occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate , where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible border had been crossed .
but one can not say , he had always looked at .
this is simply not true .
in 1980 the inspec@@ tors in schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria too .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis affir@@ med it is unfair to apply the current educational standards to the then time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger , the past , according to today &apos;s moral scale .
the princess has already been right .
but this is of course not true for sexual abuse who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was being broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of opposition and violence on inno@@ cent children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp , which goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ active .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ rings and pull in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when bodily punishment is then forbidden , he has also kept strictly thought of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Rain@@ bow Time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger given in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject of a sentence also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , he tells of his perspective since the cathedral @-@ sp@@ ans play only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regime there .
but even this must once said : without this perfection , without this perfection , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world domination , true heritage of Europe and its musical tradition , which went straight to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bondage alone , one does not have a big singer at all times and stand out before every success , right in whatever field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced during the talks about her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : through working on the book and beyond that I experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , ab@@ re@@ mun@@ er@@ ous , deep @-@ faithful and hearty people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could easily do some fly .
I get regularly with how many former domains are still today , 23 years after his embar@@ king , regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he was once strictly to them , so are clearly in the minority .
most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father@@ less teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect , to which they still look up and to worship them .
and please , once again clearly : all that one throws to him are educ@@ ative methods that were at that time on the agenda .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because it is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make medi@@ al scap@@ e@@ goat .
there is the nasty intention behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , relie@@ ves him .
now the attack areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great merits , and without which Germany would probably know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , at last no one would have met the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
