<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren Anstalt where young people today should meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit-chapel, where now stands for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the single reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when land maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had already had an upright position because the car-Navi was held instead of a bypassing road a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geo-Portal of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but is therefore very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large oversight map for cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called urine-sheets, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were written according to the Bayerisches Constituent Administration between 1810 and 1864 and entail the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Heereside occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic record of Bayeron - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops went off with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph had progressed the project forward, founded the" "" "topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermeasurable government." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional blatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early morning is most impressive at the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendle are concentrated around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße that was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance: with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbers with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbers from the so-called "Urals," which was derived from the basic tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not prove to be farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showroom of the October Revolution, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional leaf, one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street names "at the Gasteig" or from the ascent "On the fan," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse paving once people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Munich circuit-irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard led the establishment of the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought to King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accusation of the so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has banned the personnel to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East since 2006 is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">The young Auer Anstalt area will now meet young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and walked in a teenager with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football ground of the TSV München East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, one set up the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" - in architecturally tense to the country building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as the main square, the Kaufman street was named "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Bombs of the Allies were torn in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages had once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are working and performed on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory council for the federal state of Missouri, which should come into force until 28 August 2017, where travelling through the State needs special attention and be expressed in the first caution, since a number of fragmentary, rallure events occur in the whole state and here will be noted," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to gain a crime of discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the State, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have been breaches of the civil rights, people happen.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they will be collapsed or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist intervention against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Secretary-General of Missouri, in which black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring interest or relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crimes reporting programme of FBI, which set the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to shorten a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil-liberties Union (ACLU) were issued for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration laws had to pledge the local law enforcement authorities to prohibit people because of immigration law, which according to ACLU will contribute to another breeding.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezvous project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidefence-Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestags from Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family representatives met Thomas Schneider and the two MPs together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave us insights into his farm in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals, and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is for him the alternative driving force for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste comes exclusively regionality.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also BLHV-chairman of Fisherbans, he called the Weidezvous project as "elementary."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot put on such steep surfaces not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green-surface area for much work, a lot must be processed with the engine mind.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the terms and conditions and with the topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it is not a bioenterprise.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the commune has recognized the meaning of the consecration project and is happy about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "we hope that the forestation of the areas could be moved still a whole while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they bring their business further," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is about 40 hectares, which must not be neglected until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers love 12 610 euros, who had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of wheat.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do a really good job, without farmers and land women it is not."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss stood firm," "" "here the best food is produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes-linear (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state-of-government promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>

<seg id="95">For the fisherman's Weidezvous project 2018 at the moment the request of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure surface is equivalent to 35 hectares, the low-mounted costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President for drastic immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller reached not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of the boat owners and Liberty Imiters would have spared him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their meaning, and in particular the meaning that her was written when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta" "" "I don't want to enter a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... an American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies properly properly, but as he shaped it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary response to the stirs words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your natured, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who yearn for it, free to breathe, / the elding waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to be seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller got involved not in literary critic - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they have accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by pointing in an unused classical diagram showing the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has received one voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant coffee and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to switch back from the right wing this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not one, but rather an early neocon, which bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torches should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here pushed onto something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeless people after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in true sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, adorable.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals and candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which can be traced to Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eiliie Doyle was elected from the crew to teamrider.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is fairly modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shottically or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete at the 400-m hurdles at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 jackets are in the British team.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle reminiscent of her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannitts capitalin says that they are "huge" on the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also join the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"what is special about the team of the team is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the shoottoes which belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise on Podes.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and to profit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will be just as a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking criticism about Facebook: Beverb not to send you a public office if you cannot tolerate the defendant of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew some of the poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers smote it because of everything, from the interior policy up to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He stimulates in the critique, secure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumm, we are led as the sheep to the battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to governor Larry Hogan who must work on it to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Rights Union defendant him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The chairman of the Governors left the lawsuit as fridvol, and the online comment was full of an backlash with "Na, and?".</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitler head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of its state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary agent to combine with his voters and to debate his hailess head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governors of the Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated as officially and by employees working with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speak spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of drills or spammers or hashfilled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtfully and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not filled in water, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>

<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocks a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to gather newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or hide demonstrators and silenced.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise that he shakens Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasized: "it is a unique village of village."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle has been mentioned for the first time in the Wurttemberg. "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold" the mountain with the parish church and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard by Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>

<seg id="481">The newly created bell hatched then for the first time 1692, but later had to be released in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was untight.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 encamped French troops near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They braked out the pulpit and church chairs, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from listening.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery had been extended and the Hilariuskirche was stopped.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules, which aim to prevent unforeseen expenses of European football, will not disturb Neymars world chord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that the European game has supervised the power, crews of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair-Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean PSG to point out that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money loose, with that neymar underwrites and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy of the wealthy ruler of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may apply for a lot of money to acquire players, but have to be controlled with legitimate sources, which enable them to provide a break-on point in their on the football business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election at the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had put tremendous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheating and rised to ruin, if banks or owners returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP declined from concentration on the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - to a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">While the current three-year-year-year period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was fallen by the presidency in Ungnade 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred of excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly, FFP is not dead and we are determined by the rules for the future" "", "said Andrea Traverso who is responsible at UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year deal, so that the cancellation policies can be postponed for the next five years in the amount of €44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by entering their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catcher company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring the standard market rates should exceed, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the value of the PSA's sponsoring took place from the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to neymar about payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar World Cup Ambassador will be and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could simply figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be enlightened to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, sagging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports indicate that PSG 2015 / 16 generated net sales of 542.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year need to be published yet.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship-deas, merchandising and tricotics.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League has been clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent Neymars waypoint by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to the latter's ownership of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>

<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose they commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overeach other, so the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative in order to resolve the submission.</seg>

<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic classy window of Retrouvius down on the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make him seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels the mirror like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer mirrored units space for all cutters and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>

<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained additional 16 m ², one extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculation a calculation based on the bottom-size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps of new leader is planning to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new leader of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more like course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "as John F. Kelly, the new leader of the White House, at his first working day, he set up a main problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that would fall into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tump Trump by monitoring its media company.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to TV goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his televisions still is strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February toward Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter's habit under control, according to six former election campaign, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter's habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these warlike officials know something that we didn't know others - that Trumps Tweets do not have any more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets who has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff have created it for several times to keep away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it, that trump controversies emerge.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house that unites themselves from competing parties, repeatedly try to move its own agenda by promoting tracting material that may be promoting their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons, doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-official say that trump as a volcano may respond to negative press sections, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he will try to figure out where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Just that happened at the end of February, when somebody was accused of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rod of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leak in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned because of Schikanen permanently from Twitter or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he voiced false evidence in the past and voke her in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump las the article and started to ask people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then leader Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that folded?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its consultants still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1527">Now the broken piston was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Scarlet floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow in the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this sweep was the balance of wax and aborting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A full swing is there, AWI researcher writes by Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"" "" "" "I am talking about the fact that the Larsen-C-Schelhois is in danger, for the pretend have never been withdrawn as far as currently." ""</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate is standing under tension and can fall in case of a key point out a piece of droche.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, since they swim on the water and pushes ice so much water as it results in the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the sweep leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in proportion, the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarctica (MIDAS).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is according to AWI-data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres, the four-largest hofefei of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the end from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural action and not a direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the far retreat since the start of the record" "", "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists may be disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis now will grow back or over long, and possibly flowed, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not return to climate change, this gigantic ice rump will not fall back to climate change, so in the last decades there are very many ice-tuft of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long finish of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice-surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has gone back to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have been around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus counted among the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil and ceaseless drugs wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with granulates, or leave them at home in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspects on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no relaxing break from the violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took office. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection, and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you find a publisher and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be felt deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his Middle-finger with the word "Justice," hanging at the facade of Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporter discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was a Sonder Federal Reserve established in 2010, in order to edit the cases of journalists, this was initiated by the committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year connected with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist that the violence of saloa is to be treated, although they are insignificant and even though the terrain is now even worse.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this Workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot to him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve-fold river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius was driving in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to travel freely in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest last year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, since rivaling factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of sold, two-story Mausoleen for drug royalty, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a condition of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug commerce in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings into the murder have contributed.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues reported that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "was it impossible to run journalism without going to the rodowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and turnover and advertising took.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Journalists loved it to be able to publish hard apt studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else had to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committees to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever they did.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you need to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dumplmen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what happened?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a dockers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayanabo, the bar towards the office, and always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she ask: was his love for the routine of his pit?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their canny and runways" to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it's wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that 'smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, are no longer considered as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside sought out two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who spoke the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where drugs bankers are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has licked to three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former renowned boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, focused on the town of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write, what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local manufacturer of drug addicts and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was recorded from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a poliers who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled nearly all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-fledged cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers that are dedicated to the killings of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez schnaute a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>

<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez accused the authorities, journalists and bring them out, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her that she has been re-divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preservatives and Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the board, and decided to see more accurately.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant-eaters, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably by meat freshen dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paracharation technology that is known as a counterfeit one, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say expert, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature made of the family of Nodosaurier did in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta markmitchelli under the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours making it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astounding maintenance of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the shape of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-gradations, a widespread defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-lubrication is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure by meat eating dinosaurs, that evolution favours the tear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-gradations - think of deer, zebras, or gutter animals - are much smaller and hurtful than prey, which signaled that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory-animal behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the chalk had been to be," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his concentric Darminhalted to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which hang almost instrange - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret services analyst failed to serve a 35-year prison sentence, after they were made public-fed diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and a pioneering discourse whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and could look out of the 30 portraits, even if some intellectual comment may not only be interpreted about the formability of DNA data - the many ways as it can be interpreted and the indurary determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already talked openly since her puberty about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations against the SpionageAct, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grander, black-white selfie, in which Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and a platine blonde perils has been associated with which it was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portrait of strangers from forenian artifacts like cigarette-mumel and chewing gum by extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they made an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press release of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarnate Muse were interrogated with unequal letters, which were exchants in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of the Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Support Images" which would foresee a future in which the President Chelian verdict would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released, Manning release was asked for seven brutal years in a military-war in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet ways that he actually should fix, continue to inflame.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery written down, Manning called with her superlarge signature, including (the "i" in her family name) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis of gender, breed, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is a thousandal of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 letters (or Nuclotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary on the artist), as amazing, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it appears with a release preacher in hand from the disciplinarkasbarracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get gooseful when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was prescient in the Comicbuch, but if they should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulars that unite like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers mourn the process not.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources start-ups is on the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee commitment, it allows companies to initiate surveys, specialistic groups and complaint hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and FitBit for tracking their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software Analytics tools from companies is used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and polls from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which executives may have low commitments results - so that you can drill, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to remain involved in order not to be the next Uber, which has been involved in scandals, which describes a blog post office, which has been an environment of offences, for those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business possibility.</seg>

<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize an ascending interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and watch the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the judgment of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees are badly treated or unethical, there may be costly consequences by consumers-boycott, workers' flutuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has already been used for more than one year to ensure that staff are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or e-mail for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, since the company converts up the company, the problems previously sat by managers who have been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unsmarter practice- faster and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree viewpoint into the experience with employment," Vitrano that directs the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent provide your software as a service and strain the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital Investors, who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">It won $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices heard, then they feel more committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach renders when their portfolio companies are well running. companies are well running when employees work and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you can find assistance.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about the employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretaker of a business does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the shift does not come quickly enough or not at all, it can breed any disappointments and deceple.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must have prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to rely heavily on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now manages monthly workers surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And following collecting feedback from frustrated staff, she was able to organise and add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2367">He foresees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary working permit and limitations for families-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republican and supported by the President.</seg>

<seg id="2377">"with the decision to order to order and sane the route from Ilmenau race, the country knows itself to this especially important connection," stated by Klaus Sühl, on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the race-off-shuttle will be ordered in December 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be crazy in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeried professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey said during the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpirks have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin, which feels warm to the touch - with consciously human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adjust its robots according to their beliefs" "" "and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the type or colour of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" who would have a Stepford-woman to look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as bulk solids.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the "True" ion xy gold robot with pre-programmed celebrities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shattering and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of true companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like what you like and they don't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - really like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this climb from sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the substantive female characteristics, the antations on rape, if one move a step to Frigid (called here: ressing) Farrah is unquiet one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website normal companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why do men then not have Roxxxy? 'is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fairy or just just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing sophistication indicate somewhat darker and deeper into our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notice their rising popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is leaked from the edge-zones, can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or offensive until the free market gives this permission for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House who has been praved to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterred aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the intertwisted body and the outgoing eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words: they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps a great achievement?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of a healthy man.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binders of the trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate, also families in the small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntethankfully, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Trump-chosen relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposedly urge us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice has been to bring the power trumps to families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet living in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows she knows, including Republican kinship, with whom she had fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a further context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the distorted effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the grossest way that one day does not encounter us any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is a startling long-term scenario, in which trump republicans of the right wing, "normalizes," that suddenly appear as a term of negativity compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of forgetting - the dog on the Autodach, the 14% income tax (but at least we know how his tax return) - which both occur in comparison to trump in fact a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican only be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New York Parkdepartment, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cracked and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music conveys this in strange manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many stereotypes of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not entirely across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not part of - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-er years go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option, the rating with a 15% tips from the same - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apprehensive while I made tired of having my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius from the prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistous left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of dukes in his hospital, which he suffered the Penal authorities according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistous was condemned to the prosecutors due to murder of the prosecutors against a first total of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day, 2013 by hanging her several times by a door of the toilet cabinet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistoilus claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intruder, who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to put this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistous Appell, from which they say they be too short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Agency said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistous is at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help you relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Rotten meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, affected in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes stomach absorption, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to relieve meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure harmful microbes that hide inside the body, not invading the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was determined that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell on mice occurs, which carry a specific bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition is tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movement, if the same system is also ravel at people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes the tolerance, when she found that a group of study people had such cells but another group of the same tribe but separate, this did not have.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of the mice were sequenacted and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them out of mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a mortal environment so that they were missing a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers have to grow L. reuteri in a liquid and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant dusting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan-metabolism known as an idol-3 acid-acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells has been halved by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues have been halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant nurturing cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri the cells in people develop as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report entail pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of the abuse of the Pope George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisler, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated following the publication of the German press agency, he expects from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muatzinger, the 93-year brother of the emerious Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own submissal or false evaluation of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized that in the reporting on violence at the Domspatzen with" "" "twofold measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would have to be "shameful and shameful acts" that would be punished and in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation" said the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the day-to-day experience and prepares public opinion which is normal for normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis argued in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one likes to go to the church and this is a found freshen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "strokes" "" "had been a very normal pedagogical means" "" "to cope with children, as I was one was finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, the pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored with Ratzinger the reminder band "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he values the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese in Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high Plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 domicts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with a high degree of emotionally the punishment for the students could also prove violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants that many victims were valued the general humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories are even reconnecting with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, why the final report on abuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger tells his opinion on his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence by the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">To a lift many students stand forth his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who was handmade by the Öfteren if a Domspatz has not received a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this thesis as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you do the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just 8 pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of intermediary or fellow-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"" "" "" "the violence of violence at the preschool is also uneventful outside of its efficiency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can throw him if too late, or first contact is not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The building of the school for school, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all respondents considered - so literally - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also presents him an excellent record," "" "sincere," "" "knowledgeable" "", "knowledgeable" "" "knowledgeable" "", "as extremely well-natured teacher who served the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and boning and" "" "always by grapes of children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about its perfectionist and his high emotionality, which also already led to tantrums.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast down with chairs and threw the keyboards on the ground, but also ear-cowardly shared and too freak guys over the hair or ears, he has already given himself years ago, deeply deplored and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "however, to his honor of salvation, however, must be said that such educative methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also, I have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what is actually written in this report, namely, the placeable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, are the admittedly dreamella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself if it's not to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just moved on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is, however, the report escaped George Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the topic of abuse with the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report as well as any misconception or sympathy with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother to talk about it," "" "said a malicious sign for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a beasked student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insights and could have stayed the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that it is reckoned to him... Buben invhaunting or clearer or more rather likely to have as compared to their parents, Internatsconducts, instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any fellow-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence" "" "was to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was thrown out in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of them, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"" "" "" "however, that is just a misuse of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not an oral manager of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases, in which boy of sadist teachers were regulates and maligned, and among them were horrific on the pre-school in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they had already been on the Domotechnical for the school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was, as the most witnesses emphasise, the topic" "" "preschool" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'heavenly' states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domotechnical for the school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hemann: there is indeed a discipline, but no savicious violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims are appreciated the general humanity of R., and in many cases even positive memories of it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">This is the most still reproach to have had a look.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the events at a school which he had not worked and responsible, (so a witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently merge the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domotechnics for the purpose of which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in that he points to this," "" "that in the preschool continue to be practiced the test penalty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press conferences, he recommended urgent progress.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That of course was at a time when it was a legal clarity, when testing was forbidden in Bavaria too long.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he had always looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">In 1980 the inspectors in schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis affirmed it is unfair to apply the current educational standards to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "pitfalls of Anachronism," i.e. the danger, the past, according to today's moral scale.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not true for sexual abuse who was abominable at all times, and also not for what was being broken in the preschool of opposition and violence on innocent children's shrimp, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reactive.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means to disciplining and punishment, so earrings and pull in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When bodily punishment is then forbidden, he has also kept strictly thought of it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Rainbow Time has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of a sentence also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, he tells of his perspective since the cathedral-spans play only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must once said: without this perfection, without this perfection, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of world domination, true heritage of Europe and its musical tradition, which went straight to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bondage alone, one does not have a big singer at all times and stand out before every success, right in whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzinger: through working on the book and beyond that I experienced George Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, abremunerous, deep-faithful and hearty people, from which one can't imagine that he could easily do some fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former domains are still today, 23 years after his embarking, regularly contact him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly to them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherless teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable disrespect, to which they still look up and to worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that one throws to him are educative methods that were at that time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because it is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the attack areas, a 93-year-year-old man who acquired great merits, and without which Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, at last no one would have met the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
