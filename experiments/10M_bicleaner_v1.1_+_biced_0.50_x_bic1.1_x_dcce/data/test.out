a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the brother of the victim said that he cannot imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went on with him again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco , distributed the geri@@ atric medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police department said that death was classified as murder and investig@@ ates investigations .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , divided the ABS transm@@ itter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who worked earlier than chef in Boston , six months ago made his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said they were shocked by his death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and be destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are a small team who works like a close family and we will miss him painful , &quot; said the speaker .
our thoughts and che@@ ers are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks Family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia gave me that Frank lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; the things for him finally went uph@@ ill . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said that he could not imagine any one who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
to combine his kind with his family , it was always something to cook , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of debate .
he was the brother , which sw@@ am with the flow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all that works in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond that light every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has the information to the case is asked to call the Hin@@ we@@ el@@ ef@@ on of the SF@@ PD below the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I will always put in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
that has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am always plug@@ ged into drawers or living from the outside label that with me and reality usually have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather nu@@ b . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she says in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
most loved the ac@@ tress spends her time at home , pre@@ m television with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ t and Mexican food , called it in the magazine .
to the white glu@@ t they bring about the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film will run with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyram@@ ide
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a few colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; für Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remember their holiday , they said in the fast gal@@ lop to the feed box .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament winners - again close to horses .
he allowed himself to lead his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he is not even pregnant for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German sports help handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala , the Golden World Pyram@@ id . &quot; &quot; &quot;
awards won &apos;t lack the sympathetic athlete .
Bundes@@ verband cruci@@ fied , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already lo@@ dged him .
long is the 18 pri@@ ze@@ winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first winners of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it will not only be awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave up the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shot at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent include the athle@@ tics Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ver , the Ru@@ do@@ van Michael @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , der Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ um Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand of all Erhard mir@@ ac@@ ulous .
many of these sports@@ men have arrived on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a gap to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure we invest in infrastructure and avoid trade agreements , both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
un@@ one is the two US presidential competitors , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental request .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
the , on the role of the State .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep a bit small in doubt and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to popul@@ ate the economy to death and adjust to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , maintains Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will bring regulations massi@@ vely , and it makes itself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton against it says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , he has disadvantage odds and needs money .
therefore , the taxes would increase to the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
to be invested in the must say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ e alike .
the democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ alization of the Republi@@ y Te@@ ap@@ y .
this means that there are still no other internal discussion on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power stations and drive coal mining in the US again .
oil @-@ mining is also to be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Par@@ isian climate agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , Clinton intends to extend and expand renewable energies with its investment programme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade deal , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of us want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the should be paid better then , asks for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
she wants to increase her at 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ enter , then he says , he may not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand there is Tr@@ ump that wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , so the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any frozen woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone flee , almost already to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put their little son into the arm .
he gu@@ essed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother is rigid on the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen have fled .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro family and Munich &apos;s women &apos;s aid .
un@@ long , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even as a visitor .
the exception is an watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has made their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted , because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at women , others ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al yourself secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ orary mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that once they are in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
also here all the women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inf@@ erior and worse .
this leads to about 90 percent of women living in Munich &apos;s north , trau@@ mati@@ zed in the north of Munich , it appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar to say that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , openly talking about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t have to help out , there are more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , some will answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in one of the governments not .
in Schw@@ aben , even in Schw@@ aben are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press review of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separated by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are home separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or men and women are housed together , it may come to - on @-@ going - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this protective need , one can read the cr@@ ush , which there is to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has spoken about it , we have been around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily be a second house .
assistance boards : demands for new work@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assistance of the assistance workers have called on their union to approve new work amp@@ ly measures with their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council from beginning of September to find more work .
the J@@ DC said that he had failed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
assistance and medical students in July have voted on the rejection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the Chairman of the J@@ DC cub@@ its Mc@@ Court said that the government would have been &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems what led to the contract was refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC executive committee voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and requested new negotiations with all these concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has provided a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate a running program of escal@@ ating labour measures , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in preventing assistance in the year 1960 , the first aggre@@ gate waste in the history of N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election to reject the agreed Terms , which were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still ahead of the vote by 5@@ 4.000 ass@@ istants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote of the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the treaty for doctors in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of foreign lateral &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Peter &apos;s Palace in reception , I can not rep@@ el the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles worked sh@@ li@@ ly and he was hardly a heat , even for its backward conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan once again spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve themselves .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved as if never had happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seems rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his imagin@@ ary : the shut@@ down of a Russian struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ aged .
he shared Putin and accused Ankara to have fallen back into the back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
the c@@ ousin of c@@ ousin is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long , the state @-@ controlled media resulted in a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials who have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on hand .
Erdogan is primarily necessary to get all friends that he can get after the last month after a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat was almost his place .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey very hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relie@@ ved when flights are recorded again .
you count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the state television cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural import will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulate it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because it &apos;s reaction to the tried to consider power @-@ taking as weak response .
to do this , the continued res@@ entment against the bli@@ ck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke is to draw from the cool atmosphere and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west .
the Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he tried after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat to the elected government bodies .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow as a matter of course , which has itself a deep @-@ se@@ ated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present a analy@@ st to portra@@ y &quot; Alliance of foreign lateral &quot; : two countries which viol@@ ate the West and feel poorly treated and now united .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradic@@ tory pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it might be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of first talks , both Presidents were told at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even have to grasp the subject .
the President of Turkey un@@ inten@@ tionally promised to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open en@@ m@@ ity - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dis@@ cord , when NATO member Turkey inter@@ cep@@ ted the Russian batt@@ jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank R@@ BS , the R@@ BS will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS joined the bank with the global ambitions of the bank .
since then the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time brand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been used to protect other end consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for private customer business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand will be at our Invest@@ ors mark as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we become more of a bank of brands now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees are working under these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will not continue his Six Day sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of different brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to evolve into the Bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said Chief Executive Board .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years if we had said that we will be a great bank for our clients and that these brands would have launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can lan@@ ci@@ ze these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction his 3.@@ 000@@ ,000 profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed Champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 earnings
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori insured on Friday its 3.@@ 000@@ ,000 British prize at New@@ market .
he put a milestone in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction by John Gos@@ den , on his local track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ god , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that this happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ana Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the Ju@@ bel when he gets his victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ ited career .
L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ Winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone just a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is its tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma loved fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would already have gotten 6,000 prizes if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie already has nearly 30 years of winning players in UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , what is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying disco .

a whole series of wholes@@ al@@ ers win , including its famous &quot; glorious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six months , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said before at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia Putin &apos;s chief leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his chairman Serge@@ y Serge@@ ov , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the narro@@ west confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as the special representative for the environment and transport of transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged for reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the prestigious State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is ( in Russian ) that he later Chief of the Chief of Govern@@ ors and Chief Manager of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as heads of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV broadcast@@ ed on Friday which Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mystical .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time among the closest Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a leader , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin who was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will return at his own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
what is the result of a kind of power fight ?
this is currently no one knows .
but the official claim - that a man who was once conceived as a potential president , at once the Russian environmental policy - came upon great scep@@ ticism .
in his comments on Putin , who quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , giving me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ ain@@ able post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov participated the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , which replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of the five people he trusted .
once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia since Putin &apos;s second term in Putin &apos;s mandate against the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became President three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he proposed producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement its termination .
Gib@@ son who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , apologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his notice .

details about how the character Gib@@ son &apos;s character comes out of the series which is followed by a team of F@@ BI agents , according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS television studios are expected to be published at a later date .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart into my heart for the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in one on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible now .
I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the planned appearance of the twel@@ f@@ th season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles around fishes who landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of the fish help , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act at the 75 fishing around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sp@@ elled by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope , a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion Swiss project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ la Cros@@ sing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four sealing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rope .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion Swiss project will be completed until May 2017 .
for the economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown , the construction site took a visit today and was one of the first to run from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Year Cros@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sl@@ um between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge is at her place and the last leg of the Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first reference represents a significant milestone in each of the bridge project .
with this fantastic project the cl@@ utter is looking forward @-@ looking high @-@ end and deep @-@ mining .
after installing the last road range and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to then close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ination of about 3 % .
delicate , since the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny were - on each side they bore only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck yet to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck by Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in security while their boat was moving from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and presented us the worst , &quot; said the head of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds already blows the boat except their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved from a local fisher@@ man &apos;s boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a bo@@ on without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastline and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still being alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor was in fact equipped with a p@@ sti@@ p@@ one , but these holes were loos@@ ely controlled by the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awakened over these men today .

who builds the Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing to lead a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should really build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas will need 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the major dispute point in the town hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build a private area ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build such areas at least 10 per cent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing development program , which will cost millions and needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants power for investors .
regardless of this , so Brat@@ mann , bah@@ ns is a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the programme is not entirely completely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case .
how is it balances in the loss of another around 1300 @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will be run in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , as the planned spre@@ aders in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ running ties from the city .
furthermore , it should have been designed to get back to the price delivery again .
this is possible in the West city .
in one stroke the problem can solve .
because in the West town the end of the year is running .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : we do not want the owners , the apartment building .
because the number of social flats in the West city has dramatically increased , one removes themselves from the goal of so @-@ called penetration .
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts will not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been scre@@ wed during the last decade .
in Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and to be more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then to video games and finally limited to smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that &apos;s based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later , a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ Off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of Pop@@ ular culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the launch of the market in other countries has been postponed due to massive demand that over@@ l@@ ends the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon go even more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players with their smartphone are outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed up with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the lookout for the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that ref@@ utes the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to get active &quot; from the sofa , &quot; because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued .
who drives sport regularly , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to bring them here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always there are also murder@@ ous toys , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and in doing so many people on hunting will help to be active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ ine
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the spr@@ ing@@ horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tur@@ k er@@ kl@@ om@@ m ended on Thursday at the multi @-@ time title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of the spotlight on the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ it@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ ers on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campa@@ igning women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin , who won an extra @-@ made title and total the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fy their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out her tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success makes them the same league such as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has been dominating the sport art over the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ans of 1984 Mary Lou re@@ ton of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
they anticipated a final test in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas return , would be considered as disappointment .
the American , Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace both gold and silver in the retail team of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal at the Tuesday , while they were reti@@ ring in the retirement party in retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi , as a re@@ fe@@ ather sign .
although Bil@@ es existed , during their long bow to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not true .
part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother , during a school crash into the gym was discovered in which Bo@@ or@@ man is tra@@ ded , became power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has not lost any multi @-@ fight competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turn@@ outs easily caused the picture .
Schwe@@ be@@ ki and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es the world title holds - lau@@ ded .
she returns with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 in the ste@@ ep@@ y again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on that .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her as she was expecting her end @-@ to @-@ end - a pure form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ unded in Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she was fighting for the third place , but bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of team had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil exercise she cast into the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which is sometimes doub@@ tful .
as for what it concerns , the long @-@ term T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old has quite a new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial murder@@ ous fall in the car shot in the car
according to police reporting that were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot , who died in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer from Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the do@@ ers mo@@ ist eight shots from a fire@@ fire@@ arm while he was on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ case , as the att@@ acker can not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police prec@@ urs@@ ors by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators promised to look at a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine attacks and two further injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , has been hosp@@ it@@ alized because of her wounds and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness shared by the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting at an empty Pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and that it is understood that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ancers and insured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ recipes : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to , S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his ageing has Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that has nothing knew about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he got home the first time , my first thought was , I created it .
I created this not .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband told that Ed@@ mund may never realize it and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a salary .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life , and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle cycling .
he also likes to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which is Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him character to him , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ recipes has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the c@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the associated control .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds itself of the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked constantly , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the c@@ avirus .
it gets better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana led the governor to call the not@@ ables on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in sou@@ theastern Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ all , reported by the national weather service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared with that state officials stand in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been on their way to the municipalities concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ don of Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiple .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa has requested ten thousand sand so@@ cks .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used for wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the Wetter@@ dienst conf@@ is@@ hable that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall .
in the south of Alabama , a Fl@@ ut@@ breakfast system was deployed on Friday while in the area of Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach over the weekend track record .
the me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a stro@@ lling @-@ back@@ floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as it can flow only slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ti@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue team still t@@ apped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son took place among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , passed over night strongly .
he said that another step @-@ of @-@ man who lives near , warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awakened and the water flo@@ cked and p@@ anned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years , in which she had never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabled , and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ ium had saved all three in a big military truck and had brought them to the next fire watch in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; had quickly spread out , since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities are hesit@@ ating for ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer was found near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday tomorrow about 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been greatly benefited by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road out@@ puts the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and popular failure in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a Coun@@ cill@@ or in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 over@@ und@@ ated houses ang@@ ab .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were both sw@@ amped now .
the pre @-@ ste@@ er of the community Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergen@@ cies were arranged to accomo@@ date the ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be back into their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa have been closed almost two dirt roads due to the flood of water and sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to enjoy the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big floo@@ ding we had was in March &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acy Far@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in the pp the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information a handful of houses on Thursday should be reported as being flooded , but on Friday have not been reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was sh@@ attered by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ting the transm@@ itter with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter with that he is expected to be restored .
he would have to start the first class in a local school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reported on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and police were determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
pat@@ ron@@ ry pul@@ ses for storm @-@ tubes that have been traced to different assault rif@@ le , s@@ wir@@ t the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .
on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , found H@@ ül@@ sen .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; shared police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia / broadcast@@ er .
there were also several houses and cars met in the area .
there came to no strongh@@ olds , and the police are currently checking reports according to reports .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl was hit by a qu@@ ir@@ ger on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it gets caught up and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I put under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ am@@ ity in the tower and that is for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ dine is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ s an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics and in America .
now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , yet master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin who won gold at an individual multi@@ f@@ used event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we do not experience the top of this sport , but do not look like this in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four turbines in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality shows that Tur@@ k is a dear@@ er sport and tur@@ ner is primarily maintained in private trainers who pay for the training , furnis@@ hing , travel - clothing , clothing and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) .
the majority of those sne@@ akers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the tur@@ ner received its entire training and that is for the families a costly and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the tower .
we have to be inspired to the municipalities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making an affordable and easily accessible turn@@ around .
I have founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
with my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ ers that will earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and for educational and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to look for the turbul@@ ence and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Dut@@ y of the Olympic Mann@@ it@@ gol@@ ds and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance programs would like to organise further strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal refused .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adopting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistance centres that vote for a vote refused him .
in July , Hun@@ t plans revealed to introduce the contract to the contract and said that N@@ HS was ordered in a &quot; no man land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the people and patients .
the first assistance programs should obtain a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of ast@@ er@@ ast@@ ering times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit for Ass@@ istenz@@ aries shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ass@@ istenz@@ ologists have serious concerns , especially that it is to heat the current staff crisis and to treat it to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks that still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve any dispute through the government had to take part in the government and sometimes on ear @-@ af@@ ening silence .
it was that of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only last month about it , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the concerns of the assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should he not do this , so the ass@@ istants made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work @-@ off measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes through an acceptance of the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to provide a better week@@ day for the 5@@ 4.000 ass@@ istants which will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of N@@ HS staff , urged the assistance to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ timer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour amp@@ ly measures reach nothing of the only little , but also strain teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and inter@@ rup@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ mit of the assistance centres and responded positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other key topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific wage process in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication which can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after having been recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period .
the extru@@ der medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke if or another heart attack is reduced .
the regulatory Authority N@@ ICE des N@@ HS recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory Authority N@@ ICE des N@@ HS recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of which suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries , the sie@@ ge form .
when the day breaks apart , it can cause a cl@@ ot@@ ape that causes the flow of blood to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack .
when the blood th@@ umb triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ cor@@ or , which is produced by British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft design of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health Technical Support Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ grav@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attack and stro@@ kes at people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are delighted that we are able to extend the options available to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all , the risk of blood - is restricted to a period of up to three years . the draft bill recommends no treatment that goes over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ian &apos;s election was blo@@ omed in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man last year on arrest of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t has led to this widespread election was know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles under@@ takes the police , el@@ ective and main Town H@@ alls to have evidence of voting abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excess of eth@@ os and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister for the integration and local government , which now is a antagon@@ ist of religious motives , said that the intimi@@ dation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives would be bad that the police should be allowed to set off lock@@ ers outside of electoral cables to safeguard cre@@ ted voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a document in order to prove their identity by elections .
at present a vot@@ er must merely call his name and address .
the report proposes not to move remot@@ ely Tin@@ te to the finger of a person when they give up their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to res@@ tra@@ ints and decisions of non @-@ official Com@@ mit or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud but also the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial culture , which goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Pole and@@ als in the east of London .
last year a special court decided that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man ought to be contained in the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ple@@ dged the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to racism and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel is to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which one person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said it would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed particular alert to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - in the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling of out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pakist@@ ani or ban@@ ana background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not know@@ ingly ignored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist stamp will edit to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory to immigration and welfare purposes .
consider options considering the choice of your ID .
not remove tin@@ ent ink at the finger of a person once she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic review of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit to applications for an automatic brie@@ f@@ choice .
ban that political activ@@ ist can process complete brie@@ fing and envel@@ opes of let@@ tering sel@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police give the authority to set up bul@@ locks to vote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a legislative change that facilit@@ ates an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law 1983 ) .
photography offered in el@@ ective stations .
requirement that only English in the election stations must be used ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff will rule out that voters alone go to the electoral cables .
Sir Eric falling over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no fir@@ ming show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for on account of a L@@ itan@@ ei at corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been sufficiently known for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ inspections &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the turn@@ tables of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the judgement took place in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud inheritance than the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and co@@ vert spread of electoral fraud and ex@@ propri@@ ation of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one who has gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which fli@@ pped at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympics , which have more than just a certain resem@@ blan@@ ce with wood @-@ sc@@ opes .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
except K@@ ates double @-@ viol@@ ate on the bike track many people on the internet point out how a certain arch@@ ar@@ cher of the Twin @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures that he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , ar@@ cher was given the madness in the social media and gave it to hear that he has already heard of his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see a big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , &quot; Bra@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly emerge even more at the center : the attentive similarity between the British fores@@ spr@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .

a gang higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova notes more than just the sun@@ lit skin and bl@@ ond hair like the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan was Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : one Twitter users was very happy about the fact that others enjoyed the similarities .
theory posed into the room : according to this user , there might be a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared her cont@@ entment that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the comment@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off , when he is able to dis@@ miss his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 6@@ 200m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald who was brought to the comment@@ ator on the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the attack , Baby &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the criticism of Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , where he asked him many of his speech .
Twitter @-@ User didn &apos;t hold back as they heard , how uns@@ ph@@ able Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # An@@ ek@@ elt .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast@@ ed over a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a unfortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ ru@@ ed in the end of more than 90 times in the people who responded to the pam@@ pering on Twitter
the comment@@ ator Col@@ lie Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC informed and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave us a message .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we spent yesterday night quickly at our spectators and exc@@ used our followers in social media .
to clarify one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were inadequate and a unfortunate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald apologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment that I made after the Frauen@@ sch@@ wimm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us turn , he said .
&quot; I looked at the performance of the swimming pool and not related to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark he@@ ars about woman who under@@ wear ling@@ erie in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to see where they should see their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try shelter .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they reported as she looked out in it , she moved out and put them back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she moved back and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the selling space , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the cli@@ p@@ board , moved their own strains and pants and tasted them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a little discreet place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ ing when she returns the under@@ pants you obviously did not please as she put her back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users , before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t fall back and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person , who under circumstances would buy the under@@ pants they had tried . &quot;
MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take shelter at home that had another person and that were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to move the pieces from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and turned out and did not have been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York , to find out how to handle armed predat@@ ors at a close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind you will show you this video how you turn around for your predat@@ ors .
if you move closer from behind , then you should turn out to be first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the shaft , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the gun between your front and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him then with the knee into the bar and twist , while the att@@ acker drops out in front of pain , the weapon from his hands . beat it with the barrel and move back@@ wards as she straigh@@ ten the gun onto it .
with att@@ ackers who approach yourself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shaft , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the breasts , then turn the weapon from its handle before they move back@@ wards and set the gun at it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ os@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ bery on the safest is to submit your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .

the moder@@ ator and Trav@@ au@@ tor Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k moved his course on a Euro @-@ shaft , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher kno@@ b as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ency of its immune system .
in front of the deriv@@ ative each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment that was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light .
the thought , the flush @-@ kno@@ b is a traction tablet , which has already been used by thousands of others , but actually reside in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. Wright with physicians and medical professionals concerning the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria and their own health .
fortunately left behind nothing , what he saw , more than a bad night @-@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar things , as well as wonderful things .
from public transit to rail stations to sink , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he told , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was definitely righteous .
the only thing he left was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its prob@@ ation@@ line showed a le@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies are freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to drop off after her L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ ies was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; who shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst that I have o@@ vers@@ ed in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than this !
I will not stop here because it is dr@@ y@@ ful here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ ters Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both military @-@ bacterial bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probi@@ otics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , which thus ended , that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday life , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala which led the film Director , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have liked my respect for Ian when he would have liked some of the things that I have reli@@ ed on him , like the ek@@ el@@ dest Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to le@@ aning and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we received some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of vali@@ dated survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all questioned Mil@@ k @-@ bacterial bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally present products that are attached to lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ im@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because it had to terror@@ ises her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
having rap@@ ed away from their property , sho@@ ots of the housing co@@ operatives were the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls on cla@@ ve holes , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were surrounded and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they feared that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police told that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , intimi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive writing , streams and flu@@ kes included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances become demol@@ ished , old trash has been found
they were tra@@ ded in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past .
neighbours said they had to fight it on the streets and had to prosec@@ ute the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing o@@ gi@@ o@@ gi@@ ate them and their partners this week of violent by the property , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary educate them .
the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation were greeted by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They sli@@ pped around anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called into regular intervals , 20 years
on the roof@@ ed side of the tower building , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it has given the tenants to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step to take Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and had to look back to their actions for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have been brave to us and have made us the information we have made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will take con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and conv@@ eys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons were living at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the house administration will now have to have garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ ologies and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine sentence , having found guilty of the ownership of a drug of class B in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 during a car accident .
after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were lubric@@ ated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will enter ten@@ ant , who do not stick to the house@@ order
Angela C@@ row shared by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants which do not stick to the house order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ accus@@ ations and those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , who continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese aviation industry today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and so deeply fly that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the Jet due to the bad visibility of view is slightly lower than usual in the vicinity , however , the air forces insisted that security was at no time at risk .
surface fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese forti@@ fication , where four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese aviation industry today announced that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - so deeply , which restric@@ ts its visibility

moreover , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre are also lacking .
the German lap@@ se in the training was a change @-@ du@@ sty in his knees , with which the ser@@ ca question in Bar@@ ca is at least not clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen we@@ t@@ tei@@ es have been in Barcelona for two years now as being number one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coach Luis En@@ rique urged him so far on a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but he def@@ ends ste@@ er in most of the remaining applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to the first mandatory play of the new game , the Spanish teacher has doubts about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehearsal stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday knew Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. does not really convince .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat for pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;

Ma Long in its own league for table tennis @-@ tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ ans .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale his deputy and &quot; title defen@@ ders &quot; Z@@ hang I@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5 : 4 ) .
this concludes the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tournament and at the Olympics .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the end game and made the title to each other .
thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would pick up a Chinese title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no cre@@ aches in itself .
they had withdrawn on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their prot@@ esters in fair competition alone with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; I had said Z@@ hang rightly .
after the game of positive gold and silver medals with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponents only in the first sentence .
then he sets up the tempo on the record , leaving the hang out there only in a total of 13 points .
through the superiority of Ma did not develop the anticipated game @-@ to @-@ end match .
however , nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ change to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans had turned into a quarter @-@ final against the German European champi@@ ons Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was then in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; ultimately &quot; with lead .
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way become similar to a high table tennis club .
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its ″ enormous trouble ″ in the voting fight
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally conservative federal states to include their majority .
presidential guard Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gau@@ ge and self @-@ proof M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire has expressed something as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 rivals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame may be false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he picked up his famous medi@@ um@@ mers again .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ ies
Utah is usually a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US from June according to Tr@@ ump and his competitor from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , on the same way .
other institutes do not look at the front , but not by the distance which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered in Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question as he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and whether behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump will have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of what it would like to get the candidates of the Republi@@ can for Congress more strongly among the arms .

this was said to be the Team Leader of Ken@@ ias by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the World Association IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to make own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will be made to evaluate the IA@@ AF &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and has turned out to be F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the test and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training checks in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .

the world &apos;s anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on African countries in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
the episode took the W@@ ada Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is considered as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , the ARD always report highlighted that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of the sport .
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und finally ordered a similar study in Kenya as he had shown them in Russian L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics .

Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic leadership , Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classi@@ cal and filled herself with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in orches@@ tr@@ al , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at its pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have am@@ ber music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der Maria .
she re@@ members with melanchol@@ y to her car@@ ess with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character that I saw as Romans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormously generous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting a need for him is a necessity .
you see it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , this is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American Director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we got the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ t@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful today as they were then .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Belle@@ mere to release an 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .

Turkey : Kurdish community counts on mass evasion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not attach himself and Erdogan is sitting on gri@@ pping bags , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the cra@@ fting of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community Germany expects to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term , from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even &quot; become &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the composite of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the harsh proceeding of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup , the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass evasion to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand people from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had passed over months ago with criminal actions , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey have been on the run .
after the dec@@ eit@@ ful put@@ sch , s@@ cul@@ ars and op@@ position@@ ists are added .
many will start anew in Europe if they are further sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that occupies itself refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ al@@ ore leader compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tical cities .
that makes Erdogan the trigger pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have exter@@ min@@ ed or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president demanded that the German government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany also a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erdogan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany over the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also feared the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the Brand@@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on gri@@ pping bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just like the paper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of State , the Turks in front of the coup were the largest group in Germany because of political persecution , approved in Germany .
as of June 30 , these are 11.@@ 3@@ 91 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all have been approved by the treatment ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is not the fact that war , poverty or the in@@ adequ@@ acy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imp@@ unity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum enti@@ tles to the Basic Law are exclusively political , therefore by government side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not receive anything from the summer election campaign with - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not go back directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heav@@ y@@ Parliament has decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because so far it isn &apos;t that so far there is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ round fight - that bites .
the natives , who are to be convinced by the electoral struggle , are on holiday .
most of the most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are on the way , are not natives , so do not choose the land day .
in addition , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers disper@@ ses and out at the end of voices , only fatigue .
up to 4 September 2016 , the election and the last Feri@@ a day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over a vote close to the people today .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now in surveys clearly lies behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ zable left .
cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Govern@@ ors , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his large pl@@ ings .
he travels through the country , disper@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary war@@ rior predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , sea @-@ ering has received cold feet and Chancellor Merkel the blame at the flowering of Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its peak candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place electoral campaign .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major contribut@@ ors ; Merkel ( Bundestag ) is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not go , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel to listen .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely disp@@ ens@@ ed on the usual electoral legislation on market plots and especially shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and air balloon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so co@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lower role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you are br@@ ittle the basis that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are about like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast@@ ness of the country barely exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ igning to his co @-@ bal@@ ancing is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to go where it hur@@ ts where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is standing at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called to a particularly dedicated electoral campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats last but not least 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD had yet to become clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the petty @-@ party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should make the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holidays and reloc@@ ate their election campaign in the Internet .
&quot; online Elec@@ tions , &quot; it calls the state @-@ president Claudia Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green electoral champi@@ ons go looking for native stimulation under the holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top @-@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ ial lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tive holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : migrant women suffer from block@@ age
at the speed , with which the B 27 is sanc@@ tioned , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is always praise praise .
&quot; they have done everything quite z@@ ack@@ ly , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no withdrawal .
the construction site could be moved at the weekend scheduled for half time planned to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also praised for the building responsible for construction works , for example when it comes to setting up homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site took place on Monday to the south and also the block of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation in the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now depart from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again .
extrac@@ ting traffic by the place seems to come back .
&quot; there were some considerable discomfort , &quot; says the leading @-@ related management of the refurb@@ ishment Head of Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many scar@@ ves were looking for and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ k .
since the speed limit was not observed , the community called to ampli@@ fy the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable over@@ steps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King who made himself about the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been planted .
the fastest was travelling with 77 Credits in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the building site continues , it was qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ace that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
we don &apos;t like to look into the cards themselves .
but that the B 27 Res@@ truc@@ turing with them has led to sales revenue , lets each one ask .
however , some are more and some less concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decrease , &quot; but also that of course &quot; the tre@@ adm@@ its . &quot;
most of the most exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds distinct words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all hosts have made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover of revenue applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street wre@@ ck has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release him .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been dis@@ missed , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there would be a financial compensation , with the indication , the restaurant prof@@ ici@@ des otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B . now , they also have to carry out the disadvantages , which result by the re@@ development .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a gener@@ ously generous hand was achieved .
in all law@@ suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other tribal passengers are now less often subject to the complicated road @-@ management because of the complicated road @-@ management , he can understand .
if you can not go down , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
that its stem cell moves back after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and avian influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction works on its cli@@ ent@@ ele , which has experienced its pub in its long history .
six months of construction , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the terrorism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is constantly being rob@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now publishes a thick security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ ant status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ ant say to all of that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are demanding no one .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I will also participate in the participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Interior Minister , however , be located at the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi@@ f@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach leave a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but these are the more extensive ones now .
some is already known , announced , announced : that a new safety authority for de@@ cryp@@ ted communications should take care of de@@ cryp@@ ted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terror groups under punishment , and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spatial the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still consider this to be reasonable and therefore don &apos;t call anything that has no chances in the co@@ ali@@ ation partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
in part , it is partly in itself : it plans fast @-@ speed procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people from deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees that are deliberately brought into the country before they have to check @-@ in their smartphone and disclose social @-@ media accounts for a security check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of di@@ aries for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or sub@@ mitting their papers to dev@@ ise their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ inhi@@ bited and leaves questions frank@@ ly .
and at some points - in the unequal treatment of Ge@@ dul@@ ent for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees were refugees .
moreover , many people in the face of the high refugee numbers are worried about safety .
and things which put the people deeply , were not allowed to complain in election times even in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the re@@ assurance is great .
and yes , it is electoral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in the subject of internal security .
in the last days , it was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ner battle over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the Ress@@ orts also calls a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also blows here to irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a return from the double pass he keep nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to make you new , be not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ enable partner , you have to show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things to see what arguments could be concerned .
but the SPD also tries to commit itself to the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled very carefully to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still , Volkswagen decre@@ es by .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als rise the out@@ put@@ ative figures worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
you can find a term in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen starts the deliveries to the second half @-@ year .
in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest highway can be present in spite of the Diesel@@ aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the Core brand , especially in Western Europe and especially in Western Europe and has again lowered the overall sale , as it noted in the D@@ ax company .
throughout the world , the VW brand sold the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the homeland market Germany s@@ uns@@ wick the shipment to almost a h@@ exag@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand@@ ed President Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est numbers from July especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has been given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote would also be deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the US , where the car@@ bure@@ tor initially escal@@ ated first , there is also further a minus to book .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of Nieder@@ sachsen is continuing unab@@ ated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only an ex@@ tradition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July the Group of Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software subscription tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the re@@ modeling of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Autobahn point to the client after conversion a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of constant diesel models .
these would have confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the transport sector was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the right to fulfill the requirements of my research commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after re@@ armament does not take place and all the typ@@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the opportunity to have customers for example a half year after re@@ armament approximately with a motor damage in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest , it would be important to avoid any damage caused by any other damage , which does not have anything to do with the sc@@ andal involving possible claims , as it was meant .
therefore , VW use the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see demand from rich savers in future prisons - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily monetary accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual case and does not look at this as a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear for its spar@@ kle pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.@@ 4 per cent pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits about 100,000 Euro on pl@@ aster or daily currency accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been 40 million Euro for a long time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and which he could not evaluate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.3 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he would give the cost to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced four transi@@ tions , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank@@ roll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the customers have rarely had understanding and change on other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the Gen@@ os@@ kel@@ s@@ verband Bayern stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for depos@@ iting , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People - and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 Newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients need to pay by way for deposits , the competition in Germany is too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said at the Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff that has been equipped with a little lush from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they free@@ ze free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gen@@ os@@ cop@@ s@@ bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see .
in the region we live well known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known for a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said actors Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Economics and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to go into the neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was tough , and it im@@ poses the immigration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany are not allowed to like this in the width .
destination plates : who buys actually records ?
lonely men @-@ aged men love hard drives .
before you want to participate in the commentary in order to outs@@ ource it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ sam@@ pled age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ tu@@ v , the resur@@ gence of Schall@@ platten is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to greet the re @-@ unity of physical objects , but due to the mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are from any fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer @-@ group .
there is also no hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
when this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I carry in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a modest tur@@ bo pull and wild@@ ly s@@ lu@@ ent before I ste@@ al , my hands hold and some determined things as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart So@@ hos is slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic panel stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I received from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men aged men , a woman , probably the 20 ) succession , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , question I ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and again buy items that he sold when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70@@ ies who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things when I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy the plates are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and willing to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my l@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets to apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and arran@@ ges themselves to buy their old records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually turn off to their collection in 1998 or in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; says he .
that would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a given age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica in order to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the contact @-@ free payment system .
some panel fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted sound drive , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as collectors , and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to get mentally concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ us@@ ks a staff of a record store . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player who will never use them while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while passing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works on sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men aged 3 ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage but it happens definitely .
more productive , less musi@@ cl@@ as@@ ingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly coming .
f@@ stop that has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts Ne@@ ver synthes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ c@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ates out of loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them sees son@@ ly lonely but na@@ ating mental trau@@ mas are difficult to imagine if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes in the shop and considers the variation of the plates available for sale .
it is more of a man@@ nequ@@ in bum@@ ble@@ bee as a large one .
she does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; They are driving with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it truly is unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the semb@@ lance of brave the je@@ ans of je@@ ans , watch a group of young teen@@ ager , who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think to buy a cros@@ ley plate player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grip them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research was taken to agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they at least exist in records in Soho , the great number of female collectors and disco@@ vers , who exist in the reality , record business and in online for@@ es .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves through plates , while they avoid the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who over@@ looks over the shoulders of anything middle ages .

French Court re@@ jects offering on demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French dish rejected a proposal of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of improvis@@ ational shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional business in which persons within the camp goods , sell cigarettes until En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be cut down , because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire@@ wall and the risk of fire .
humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , because the free meals that were offered by the state @-@ made association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but adm@@ its that the concerns in the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is shared and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable children , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &quot; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years of age are . &quot;
the two auxili@@ ary organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of living in the jungle camp living on over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals over the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains comb@@ ative

Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the time @-@ time World Cup in Qatar .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany Ras@@ a must adapt to the next generation of speed measurement : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic acting endor@@ sement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary template , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary blu@@ ff for compliance with speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery is holding with uninterrupted measuring operations five days , the case data encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be collected across several tracks at the same time .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as the access to time , driving stri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ driving state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with tags .
so that it is not easy to cl@@ oned , it is lowered inside the measurement so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way disappear too safe outside .
also , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer according to indications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states have been tested and now also used .
even foreign authorities bl@@ acks with the new technique : it has recently released France 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ ar Stadium .
Fiji offers a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , post@@ ures , line @-@ run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad in any color .
the defeat was lost by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they swal@@ lowed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals .
but regardless of this , Fiji on this form has been a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago they lost Ryan of the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks G@@ b@@ S from a lot of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell at and Co. , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went out 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with still four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack on the right hand corner that he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely saw the ball .
a hot runner from Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped in Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner has a touch @-@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ beginning and there was still a minute game ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still see@@ ded .
so it is also .
GB conducted fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ b gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant cli@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favour of South @-@ income , whose fans sang , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake and a further trial in the last seconds .
the pu@@ ff hat@@ s , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB k@@ ic@@ ts crus@@ hing out in the law@@ ns .
earlier in the days Fiji Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Great Britain forced South Africa in a scarce sem@@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ aside teams , secured profit - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than in these games and that wants what to do .
from the first ru@@ ff to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into the history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was very present when she rested for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ age in two without tax wife , the first women in the history of the British Sports , which laid such a standard .
their dominance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ loaded application , which is also unparall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not the way of the triumph@@ al .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to wil@@ der hel@@ pers who make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach , who would survive 30 months ago , whether he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he is risky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not , it spreads throughout .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could begin what the interruption stopped at a minimum if that is under such circumstances the correct term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran out at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the herd of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it even greater .
in the in@@ medi@@ bility of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ ing in the morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it repeatedly repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have wished for a better person or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm that could not keep up with their opponents .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark closed , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
Helen called &quot; remain in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let go along .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make some Tol@@ les .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ adventur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to conceive that I am a Olympi@@ ad .
it was all that new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is widely considered exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the 2nd @-@ joined staff , of which 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired in retirement at the age of 65 .
the drinking water use of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ own group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , produces about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters water each year and provides 32 places and past@@ ures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .

as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , ground@@ ing purchases in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divisions of water pipes .

the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , and has a lat@@ t .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .

if Sven S. sees , the 110 will call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Lü@@ beck , the relevant police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements on the auto@@ cr@@ acy or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but she confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a killing of a pots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the cr@@ um@@ bling exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains the extra cost to be spar@@ ed in million@@ aires .
financial burdens that threaten the industry from the econom@@ ist advancement , are from the table .
it remain in the liberation of the Renewable energy situation in the constitu@@ ents of the so @-@ called Eig@@ enst@@ ro@@ m@@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fri@@ agile issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ e to generate electricity for their own consumption , to checkout .
the steel industry continued to provide additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the W@@ AZ , it will now give a basic cleaning with the EU Commission after talks with competitive abuse Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for suit@@ ability generation .
thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be determined .
special importance was the successful attempt of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even during the reform of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emission standards &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; climate and employment targets include &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann said in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from financial capacities and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation further exac@@ erb@@ ated itself as the world &apos;s largest producer in China , given the weak@@ est demand in steel on the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ cutting pricing dumping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
for a show@@ cas@@ ing export tariff on import @-@ steel action , for others the economic prospects in China have f@@ lowed .
unclear is how sustainable the cost @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p continued to be careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices would have been more stagn@@ ant again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p not least wanted to exclude the lock@@ ings of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were occupied by the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producer remains careful , despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tons of less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic association of steel by Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the crowd went back to each other after the second month .
since the beginning of the year production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an improved order situation in the coming months , thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing hat UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in school chor@@ us , in the mag@@ ister@@ ium , she won the F@@ ach Music and today sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
in the next door , she does something good with her health and mind .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can be soci@@ able and maintain social contacts .
for frequently , social and familiar structures at the age of , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organising themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because in doing so , sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly challenges his lungs that are not so fast in everyday life as well .
even though it comes to obtain the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older people often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations , the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs with older people raised many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , he den@@ sed himself den@@ sed people in long rec@@ eded events .
at S@@ ingen the head has also requested a special achievement , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time , concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , practise not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gment that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
to show itself : if I do something for something I &apos;m going to be better and watch@@ ful over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reason to start with the singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , pu@@ ree L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ful people who list@@ ens to you when a sound is adjacent to it ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior fen@@ nel , one can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views across the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn right to the church or church officials .
many people of the old cho@@ irs can also be found via the internet .
who does not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help from interfer@@ ing .
who lust has to sing should necessarily join a chor@@ us , pu@@ zz@@ ing H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul good and has something that applies to every age .
cats react more sensitive as a han@@ go@@ ver on scre@@ ams of the kittens
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover , what effect the herd of kittens has grown on adult animals .
to her surprise the Mi@@ ew also let the males do not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of kittens on the mixing of the babies .
they are responding to ten percent faster on foli@@ age of kittens travelling in great need , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ ver also react to the ruins of kittens too - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the removal of less and heavily aroused juven@@ iles for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is first authorit@@ ative in the study , which was published on this Friday at the &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and sound @-@ height of the kittens took place with the urgency of their help in need .
a total of nine adult men and eight females were observed from the animal management of the MH@@ H .
for you were played for a herd of babies which were taken for three minutes from the l@@ f@@ box and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
at the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more aroused kittens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you turned faster to the loud@@ speaker if this ru@@ p played the very aroused kittens .
this ability may be alleged or develop@@ ele with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in humans .
also some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o @-@ Marina She@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
a arrest warran@@ t had been issued in Turkey against the one @-@ sti@@ gate foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup - an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; Business as &quot; is said .
already at the suspension of the exp@@ ir@@ ation after the crash test in July , the government , the daily lives of normal brush should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are susp@@ ects the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup .
doing so is not made before the soccer .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South of America living in America is now accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South @-@ kis@@ sed shall be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is bl@@ amed for the put@@ sch from President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan .
although the state is valid for 90 days even until October , in fact , the majority of the Turks actually has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan on Wednesday for end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponent &apos;s earth .
especially fans of the club visit traditionally are not among the friends of the President .
as far as the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
there even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sigh@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will arrive especially on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporty value placed the Cologne in the past season with proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sie@@ g@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; urged him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team is based on the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the disappointing season for the record @-@ champion found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also appeared early in the European League .
in the South of Li@@ g it reached only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and this is the most important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master sightseeing the game ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ al@@ kö@@ nig put the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the AC Florence was announced under the Treaty of AC Florence , and was announced only by visiting Gom@@ ez after the coup , because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the storms should be ready to refrain from around a third of his to 7.5 million euros valued years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man realized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence , we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals @-@ chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic D@@ oping still determines the headlines in the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ed in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock , was pushed up shortly before the games , was loos@@ ened at her start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ c@@ ess@@ los and bu@@ ed .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a set sm@@ iles , she was still proud to stum@@ ble into the hall and prov@@ oked it with their appearance .
as a festive stand that they will not get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ ant storm .
but there are still numerous other athletes , who are going to start the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ ans run from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is about 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ engers of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ans and si@@ eben@@ ch champion in had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ six pack abs , after you have proven the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong tooth@@ ache after an operation and defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europe was tested positive on the stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic bes@@ tos the pe@@ er intake and was blocked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics with 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months was blocked in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , ta@@ xed Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the far @-@ fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ accus@@ ation , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athlete were subsequently recognized as many medals .
so , T@@ ich@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back on account of a pri@@ ori@@ ent of the International Sports Tribunal .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is located in two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Go , China ) : the world premiere and Gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
during the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship points were found on the intake of a bot@@ tling dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell out and ran out on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Un@@ seen in Viol@@ ence - Multi@@ ere dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand has been in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man by the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
they suffered cut@@ f@@ aded and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
she planned her home trip in early September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacations of Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ ul@@ on also affected Austrian citizens is not yet unclear .
the State Department is in touch with the local authorities , so schn@@ au@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres at the south of the Bangkok @-@ located Hua H@@ in , on Thursday evening , two bombs were explo@@ ded .
according to police , according to police had been killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian cher@@ in , three German , three Dutch and three Italians .
Friday morning again two explo@@ sives went high , according to the authorities another man was killed .
also of ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a night@@ fall .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the near of holiday@@ makers popular beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been injured according to police information .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb that killed a municipal set .
the spr@@ int was gone according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ west coast , and in Ch@@ eng@@ on on the southeast coast several injured .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks contribute to the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai Intelligence meth@@ av@@ ee Friday , early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to speak for possible reasons - probably it is the acts of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for the bomb mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , explained the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is said that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received secrecy about the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they did not have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still it was not clear what group behind the attacks .
the police over@@ took their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment .
in Thailand there are always small bombar@@ d@@ ments , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bomb versions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is advised on his website , the instructions of the Thai security authorities as a result .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings .
after disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , no necessary journeys will take place in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this spatial bearing the military influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps themselves good in order to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not been able to get a grip on for many years in the most extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just under one year ago in Bangkok had been killed during an attack on a popular Hindu scar@@ let 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is into the visor of the Federal Ministry of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several country offices , the Constitutional Court in the Con@@ federation also provided the group under supervision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ anic movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; points for efforts against the open democratic rule , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Zu@@ k@@ able Islamic faith or of the Middle East was diff@@ used in a extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by means of alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitu@@ tion@@ er in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority is closely aligned with the country &apos;s judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extremis@@ ts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the identities of Islam@@ ists , as well as right wing extremis@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not liable for any kind of advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should address the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
finally , there had been reports on contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians from several German countries .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target and so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such people have the influence of the Party .
this is not recognizable .
having a look at the marked increase of legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugee population said , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
yet , in recent years , we have found that it can give legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite certain that further justi@@ fying group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing motiv@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clear or Europe @-@ wide controller of justification was not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were written on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned himself Ma@@ ate that many ra@@ ids went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene in the right @-@ hand scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminal , politically motivated or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences who had previously chosen not with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or have chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but have yet been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympi@@ icles or world records are the headlines in the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center swe@@ ar the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then applied to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a set@@ back of 48 seconds ended its run and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 Star@@ ts .
but it was rather a sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special strong law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since in e@@ dic@@ s , most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first pointed names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English bou@@ lev@@ ards &apos; made the English bou@@ lev@@ ards &apos; The Sun &apos; with &apos; D@@ ad B@@ od &apos; about him funny .
his time , he suggested only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , there was no part .
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i attended medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fren@@ e@@ tically was mut@@ ed by M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never taken a long distance before the competition .

he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia ( IS ) .
within his party , however , more and more resistance .

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ leadership comes down to dis@@ appoint business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K communic@@ ates his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the relap@@ se suddenly appeared - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed to imagine that the chair of the Board of Directors Matthias Hart@@ mann will be the more uncertain , the longer the success of him promised .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appoint business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the global number Five of the industry is facing a personalized new beginning .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board speaker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the relap@@ se , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation .
details wanted to call a corporate speaker on Friday not call .
who will in future become the market research organization , be still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ coun@@ ties it was on Friday at the shareholders unless a disappointment about the continued successes of years ago led to restructuring large .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring is not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the least bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholders will eventually be rest@@ less .

accidents - bus sli@@ pped in Kar@@ mu@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight wounded
in an accident of a travel arrangements with 43 Sen@@ iors as the passengers , on Thursday in Kar@@ m@@ ington ( the District of Aur@@ ich ) have been wounded .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , divided the police with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old passenger of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate their data according to a counter@@ ing le@@ aster , partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like an inter@@ viewer in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six b@@ ail@@ ers and an emergency car came to the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ solic@@ ited travelers were brought back to the Krumlov district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the burden and possible witnesses to register with the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meter wast@@ e@@ water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ver@@ k@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of € 2.@@ 10 euros , for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage @-@ fee will later increase again , if appropriate improvements need to be necessary .
after an over@@ heated calculation , the wast@@ e@@ water price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was determined by the approval of the budget by the Land@@ scap@@ ing Kul@@ mb@@ ach that over@@ looks for these se@@ wage systems .
the Market Kas@@ endorf is committed to the basis of its legal basis , to operate the facilities free of charge .
on 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare k@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deeper into the w@@ allet .
the stir@@ red increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt shown the panel was a re@@ modelling of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market community .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 will also be over@@ - or under@@ covers from the previous calendar period .
the engra@@ ving stir@@ red increases in Schmidt with it , that in all three se@@ wage systems , with a very low san@@ itation system , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus due to the low distribution basis , for instance , would affect the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros .
in addition , the waste of water in all three plants is slightly decreased .
however , in the resi@@ dual period period , during all three plants , not least because of their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt re@@ pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf , the mechanical aer@@ ation system had to be replaced due to damage .
at the P@@ ump@@ werk Cos@@ me@@ k@@ ahl had to be over@@ hau@@ led nearly 20 years of old funding complexes , and in the bat@@ ches of Lop@@ p , after almost 20 years of operation , the first Kl@@ är@@ d has had to be installed and an additional ins@@ ul@@ ting possibility to be installed in order to keep the waterproof specifications in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary expenditure , the advanced training and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which , in the years 2011 / 2012 , is still considerably below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that with the low waste of waste in the three plants , the expenditure for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully perme@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs have spar@@ ed in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to be prec@@ arious after stone houses on the long run , especially since we can &apos;t expand the water @-@ area of the waste @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to expand these systems because it is a deficit of deficit .
Bulgaria beats up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was in July 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % split .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) , was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the CP@@ I was compared to June 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , that is , the monthly inflation was 1.1 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.1 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critic@@ ised as Asi@@ atic cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is impro@@ bable against breeds .
with its filter tool , it enables sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are undes@@ er@@ ated , selfish tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections per day .
all mis@@ steps come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app would be Black@@ face convey@@ or or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter for some users who gave them s@@ lugg@@ ish , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist caricature from Asi@@ ates - &quot; yellow head . &quot;
they asked if these repeti@@ tive controversi@@ es have indicated a greater problem that the company with diversity has diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat rus@@ hed to have the feature disabled .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ aten .
but out@@ si@@ ders , which have experienced racism , the filter reminded of breaking stere@@ otypes .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art @-@ student , whose twe@@ et has been widely spread over the photos that the filter was hur@@ tful and having been canc@@ erous . &quot;
she added that &quot; It is difficult to argue with the counter@@ ing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ sighted , but that the gel was pulled into the extreme extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural cle@@ dra@@ in .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineer working for medium , her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account has requested others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they reflect that r@@ ump @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the fix@@ ation practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the most part white , only male leadership position and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ich @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its employees and points out its status as a private company .
on Thursday it refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently set up a personnel responsible for concentrating on under@@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zh@@ u said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told her sn@@ ap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military occupation di@@ vul@@ ged IS intelligence information , introduces the Committee of Congress
military relatives of the United States Central Command changed ground @-@ up information to draw an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed to report on the ground in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence , Intelligence , and the Wehr@@ budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies , who reported as prec@@ eded their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; mess@@ aging information , which were typically dra@@ fted by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ de@@ es typically , signed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual states on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article about the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can@@ ese member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership error in the Cent@@ com can reach the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed ongoing issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Defence Forces .
although there is no direct indication that government tips given under Obama statements , it shows how analy@@ st had exposed to the pressure from its predecessors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com anthrop@@ ic publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Convention of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the following reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force to life , after it was played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence scheme of Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday that deals with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com cra@@ fted an over@@ ly reduced process for the creation of re@@ active assessments to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; given the highest li@@ cking democr@@ at in coma , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of analysis reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the morality of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats gave no evidence of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analysts in regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August the New York Times reported by investigations by the Pentagon , which were taken after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence presented a controversial discussion of these important topics in national defense . &quot;
in addition , the investigations on the issue of a successful aviation campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have rejected the question of which President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the critic@@ isms regarding the secret information about the Islamic State remind us of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker took a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush prec@@ eded to the recommendations of many analysts just a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to turn out about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker would have stated that contrary to the statements of the government attacks against those of the Islamic State Re@@ public@@ s did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislative power for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is standing before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 win over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American people won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they can &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the American people are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place following their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will win the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ bur@@ ner will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead .
as always the game on Saturday may start , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after spending the past London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey layer in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since she could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went all wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , an mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have the helm from all over the world .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back envelope .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and lu@@ gs the ball into the gate around the American , a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who has so far had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel in@@ consistent and inevitable , a rapid season between competition and pursuit .
it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch would be a burning stun@@ t , who is protected from wr@@ ist@@ ening to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ hop shop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ art@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with gr@@ ows , would certainly have been under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ emp@@ athy TV if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fet@@ ters .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame cannot be illuminated every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air p@@ istol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast and let it rule for a long time .
but if I may take modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline had already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had happened in Sydney there was the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympi@@ ad species .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes , who made it to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ si@@ mile char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the most suitable for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , which combines two sports , which it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( dirt , he@@ aders and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympics , by execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists need to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and dr@@ over , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes back and back , up and down at the playground .
you do not only hunt the finish line or the wall , but in the television transfer also another ca@@ vities goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ are@@ kor@@ ds .
the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I think even during the look of these games as something ti@@ ring .
of this , the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
the moving movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back upwards .
also here prev@@ ails a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no v@@ ault in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is just as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , likewise around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will shine the narro@@ wer as part of an afternoon bloc on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one which is probably overlooked in general turmoil .
if the awareness of consciousness can be achieved only by the anxiety and the classification of masculine athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently sur@@ ges - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after air rin@@ ks , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters to demand political changes in Ethiopia , they rose up to violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in she@@ dding .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook up the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot on an un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
taking the videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , are showing how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is estimated to be the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ians economy expan@@ sive in the remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ant in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with the dissi@@ dents have been sil@@ enced effectively .
many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press people and do not have any other options apart , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous dis@@ comforts that cover everything from the bottom line up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after an extended election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament .
at the same time the tensions walk along the border with Eritrea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been imposed in recent years more or less , the turbul@@ ence could benefit and be re@@ ar@@ ming again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of breaking down the surface now explo@@ de .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very Ethiop@@ ians able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones are becoming more and more frequent and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still communicate via internet Pro@@ x@@ ies who conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they gathered themselves so much .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ chi and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since the e@@ ons of prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from e@@ dic@@ s of predominantly Christian countries , in politics and economics , while they are the Oro@@ mos , many Muslims are living and live in flat @-@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ mo@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former grape leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ dent disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was seen as tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts are saying that he was especially vers@@ atur@@ ated in doing early signs of dis@@ content and to use special teachers to edit opponents and to render them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ians of new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
different from the Lord Mel@@ es who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Albania , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the trust of the tig@@ ray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a mo@@ ver was 2005 , after prot@@ esters were prot@@ ested against the elections , according to information by analy@@ st seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts from Albania leaders for their visionary &quot; infrastructure &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ish city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred towards the tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts are saying that the protests in the USA and other Western allies introduce themselves to a peculiar position .
the American government used to Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even though they recently concluded that they closed this basis .
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally collap@@ ses in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to sc@@ atter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by ang@@ ab that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State , which was not meant seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fications gave new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can , whether he would be able to communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings together his collaborators , who will try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain any statements which he could not have meant at all .
after having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back in relation to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday he said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weaken the statement by stres@@ sing it that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know nothing about it &apos;s republi@@ can Presidential candidate .
the last storm of the critic pr@@ ash@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of the rate values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought Sar@@ kas@@ mus already to its defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism of himself , when he said the Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ tons &apos;s emails , but he later explained the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return as required .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who watches the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to v@@ ague enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a different way .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even better sound , since its re@@ frac@@ tures went further back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a guided tour in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologize for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics , to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is focusing increasingly in the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ jo@@ kes brought his loyal co @-@ ordination to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump@@ celebr@@ ity speakers , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in that sense that Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ sli@@ der , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an Secretary of Secretary served , it allowed ISIS allowed to spread themselves out to gain the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to go on each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he under@@ mines the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ ph@@ ered over Mr. Tr@@ umps as only a further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential system .
once more than the prize is pushed away from the market , café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ell@@ ent café in Williamsburg , in which you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years in good coffee .
naturally , thanks to the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals mour@@ ned it as the last loss in a distinct city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ abs wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also a re @-@ finding .
a re@@ vit@@ ated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ fit , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the dre@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are sh@@ ni@@ ches like cap@@ ers and su@@ ck oni@@ ons .
there are natural cro@@ iss@@ ors .
the cafe does not serve beer any more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was one such customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b on a regular basis .
even after it was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee @-@ sink , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b who liked to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she has drinks a coffee , even if she has ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ols Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the beginning of the year 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I came to seven days every day , like a Swiss pocket . and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not send a Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ fed coffee of cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he pre@@ fers to make them soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the site also has additional advantages .
a ör@@ t@@ onal saf@@ t@@ bar would like to fill the cold coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is located on a nearby building .
for many customers a new dun@@ geon is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tribal , and said that he was destroyed by the floor when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the subject of the loc@@ als and the funeral felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to cried out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
for gour@@ mets , President Roosevelt took a Fai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtles soup .
its menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane goat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights . they are both a grocery store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA while goat is told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home in the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine while Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ out snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the Reporter has ordered h@@ ackers , this found the couple to discuss about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man .
there was pe@@ ar car@@ rot , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat che@@ ap@@ ly prepared to have the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ble@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ined for male field@@ work and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed to breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country turned to be no longer the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buried Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ ary source : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and c@@ asser@@ tions were found to stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful nature , eating remains re@@ valued , &quot; t@@ apping brick , as cooks un@@ appe@@ aled ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry @-@ drying .
meat , which was the focus of the American cuisine for years has become a rare ear@@ nest luxury .
peculiar compounds have been tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutritious grati@@ fication had prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research on the book which includes also recipes , Zie@@ gel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zie@@ gel@@ man leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
like never before or since , fiscal affairs - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country @-@ like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ wives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to transform the Pamp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty , the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant cuisine in his kitchen , he spec@@ kled as the million@@ th heavy man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful realistic alien .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the an@@ alogy of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors through woman Roosevelt is that the White House brought the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most dri@@ est prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food was rejected once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Go@@ gel@@ man said , as well as on how science was applied to foods .
the pair included in writing the book the eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans in law was better understood - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zie@@ gel@@ man reminded themselves : &quot; They made people really sick . &quot;
there was the case of the Wind@@ beut@@ ler .
after the plates were ab@@ sent@@ ed at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had dressed at home : the pl@@ ums , President Roosevelt took over at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes had a good name to miss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no s@@ cour@@ ing cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone deaf a little reluc@@ t@@ antly one spoon into the prot@@ rac@@ ers , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of hardened Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed by bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a rec@@ ol@@ ing attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which saved the lives according to picture @-@ newspaper so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life to the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war @-@ area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians , who shows him at a 11 @-@ hour saving of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the shining symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said according to picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar was attacking himself an attack he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ters have rejected four rec@@ ol@@ bombs above the Alzheimer &apos;s disease district , one was filled with chlor@@ o@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous vesti@@ ges of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland mostly comes to the surface in winter .
this ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get over with 150 years of offspring .
leis@@ ur@@ ely the Greenland shar@@ ks along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is just about 1,@@ 220 feet far .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal .
but this long @-@ term life @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock that means for ver@@ teb@@ rates a world record .
although suspected the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already long that Greenland become rocky .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees cel@@ sius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers based on the lifestyle in Greenland know very little .
your time @-@ lu@@ pent@@ ine measurements they , when they exp@@ elled six animals with a transm@@ itter in front of the S@@ val@@ bard .
loot also make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remn@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly hunting they hunt sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and are looking car@@ c@@ asses who tor@@ rents out of higher water layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as Bei@@ ge from the deep of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
to determine the age of animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks .
this center of ophthalm@@ ologists is already emerging before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centi@@ meters long , the linear animal contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their l@@ enti@@ sts , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland at the age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centi@@ meters even 3@@ 92 years old might be old .
that Greenland @-@ females have only then desc@@ ended when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 15@@ 6 years , Greenland has obviously at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for vor@@ tices at this time .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in e@@ isi@@ gen waters is no coincidence .
even the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland , in whose bac@@ on at the neck , a 120 year old har@@ sh@@ en@@ spitze put , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism is often running out of the animals living there .
so they mature - and age @-@ slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram Eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
one very big animal should in contrast invest its resources rather in a long life .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz &apos;s communication that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently published home b@@ umps can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the property , the property and subsequent questions , the sale of the plots to be placed in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stre@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ der@@ at is convinced that the b@@ umps in the rural and quiet residential community beauty Scho@@ au young families and stock@@ sen@@ iors equally appeal .
as it says , construction will immediately report in the town hall , on the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the con@@ der@@ ate scheduled in its September session .

Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City of Main has therefore held the best opportunities in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , Head of the Excellence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary houses are allowed to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lob@@ bying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main @-@ five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the margin ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a large fund branch , cuts as well as Dublin in the infrastructure as well .
Frankfurt is clearly easier to reach Frankfurt , thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rents for class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than the main ones .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a rankings of the company counsel@@ ing Merc@@ er , the city stand at No. 7 , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin on Square 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain in the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &apos;s most important financial center .
this also addresses the correlation of forces : in London , according to figures of Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax declaration on Friday , which was awarded for the Presidential did@@ acy of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ tons of USD 1 Million for charitable purposes , primarily aimed at the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had almost USD 5 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term of office in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax @-@ explic@@ ations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri announced in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false objec@@ tions and to publish its tax @-@ explic@@ ations with regards to his previous promises .
it is common for U.S. Presidential candidates to publish their tax @-@ explic@@ ations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and its lawyers have stated as a reason for its ref@@ usal to be given a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election hel@@ pers in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential election of the Democratic Party .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Consultants , to CN@@ N that he won &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the check @-@ reviews are not completed .

Clinton has already thrown itself on the subject and released on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump call for its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke this topic also during a speech to the economy of Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential job done in recent decades and publish its tax @-@ explic@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid for two years no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist in the New York Times ci@@ dated on Friday a number of tax avoidance and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
federal control has become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regime which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett to ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal as well .
during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire Hath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their control .
Buff@@ ett said that he has been subjected to the IR@@ S as also a tax check of the IR@@ S and p@@ umping &quot; fear &quot; from the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income are related than wages , unlike most of all Americans .
their main rail system was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund , which controlled the Clin@@ tons dividends and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works by the Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
natur@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensified the idea , along with the U.S. nature conservation , has intensified their promotion by practicing volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to use a non@@ violent quad@@ ri@@ dden method to protect their homes and harvest without destroying animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is World hotline dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we have been able to observe in these communities a change of attitude , whereby they can hold much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; vo@@ iced the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps cover the illumin@@ ate of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bl@@ isters in one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he is not sh@@ elled , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ce @-@ mix with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works circle into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ig@@ ni@@ tion only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
one last option represents a value that sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ works in the air and thereby a lau@@ ght , bright explosion .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new business operators , but at this location in exp@@ on@@ ated situation at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk is not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish film@@ makers disman@@ tle Berlin hotel because Israeli prer@@ og@@ atives was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director , with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media up after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli fores@@ try , as the Arab guests would have requested to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of hotels .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how about the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ ved him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel set said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it , sol@@ ste in the director still more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has been carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the ministers said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident spar@@ ked a rather big resonance on the internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some provided the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there had been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed to you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it in another post which was pointed out that the hotel , which stands on the no@@ p@@ ous Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations from himself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the drop @-@ down list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung referred to a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ selection has now been added .

since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , the Ambassador with .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .

Scot@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call to Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the male team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the lead role that his country Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself too ec@@ tly . the J@@ plan and made the legend proudly , when he rus@@ hed to home to bring a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
in England four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y received the fifth of six Olympics .
they reiter@@ ated the trick after taking place in March by the train World Championships in London despite the departure Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as inspiration .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the sh@@ ot@@ toes which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - which started four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fications round a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the stand @-@ round the New Zealand triumph@@ ed in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der came back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a great deal of transformation , when adding a higher speed to slow it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when this went on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have had a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord in the final dogs and the world champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way of winning this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was an indication that he fell to the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England rivals .
with such a phenomenal victory , this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last three months we have come together as a team .
we have so badly gained so badly with so many world sur@@ titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we expect successfully five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he won the victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest .
this would mean for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a explo@@ iters of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the Che@@ me of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he gains two more gold medals , he should be hit the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty .
he had disputed himself before the qualification before the qualification when he had called for himself to measure its height .

the GB team relies on its strong rail@@ road team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shot of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio came down .
it played Dr@@ amas in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the techni@@ cian Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .

future of the melting of Portland due to lifting of energy consumption
the future of the aluminum mel@@ tdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake , since the plant operator will announce the energy supply agreement and thus will raise all the delivery agreements as the supplier @-@ run energy company was rus@@ hed .
this step followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years of subs@@ cribed sub@@ vention works in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the station of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting snow consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry T@@ zer@@ ei , which led to the closure of the fro@@ g@@ ea power station last year .
the melting of al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which has served the large aluminium mel@@ tdown with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares hold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also assumes that the plant in Portland continued to operate in Portland , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting of melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts were to enter into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will be contributing to revenues in the fiscal year 17 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the electric supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong deadlines for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the treaties was already written in its yearly decline in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the melting shop or ensure the power supply to the melting pot &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that there was a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in 2010 , even though it is still an explanation guilty why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
referring to the statements by the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland annually uses about 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts .
should both plants disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an Reality TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is based on the cover of the Sep@@ gue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and went to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , how she ends the cover of her sister and that with a classic twist : you have all planned a surprise .
this makes the cl@@ assy act nearly every birthday sep@@ tum of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You knew that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the honesty of a character of character at 8 am in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , security has started a new era of the car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ able big sister Kim likes them , what the Vo@@ gue cover covers , have beaten ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of a picture as a fashion magazine , the output sets a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages of advertising .
the unvei@@ ling of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is un@@ addic@@ tive , that in the last two years images of the magazine is still en@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ age model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - below the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is shipped to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone .
with her reality @-@ TV story , J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something tense .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings back high , when the message with the appears J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the dis@@ grace they seem to walk around at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e foli@@ age .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of them on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her own pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is on the reality TV to see . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community @-@ related centres point in 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid most des@@ erts of the country are being rejected annually by the local authorities , while the industry covers the impact of other SMEs on already over@@ driven transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ or@@ ations and similar assistance - have been rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly exploited , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , this legal centers will be further 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the com@@ mons centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey was revealed by the National Association of Joint Inter@@ est Centers for thousands of people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a lifting of the Federal Government would only become worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pressive debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal manner and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funds at 30 per cent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpl@@ ess@@ ful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
we demand the General Assembly of the Federal Foreign Minister and the Federal Minister of Queensland , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these cuts immediately , so people get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the provincial government filled her commitment to lift the funds for justification on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the local authorities and their customer communities , as well as the government p@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the government of government and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this erg@@ ad representative surveys of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black governance code in the North is just below ruling , this is not possible after the re@@ frac@@ ture in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and thus could have good opportunities to continue the ruling leader .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD rus@@ hed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent over the past five years .
the party thus leaves the survey only just shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the Left Che@@ ms at 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would have been present with 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
the Gre@@ ens also hesit@@ ated in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 per cent ) in the s@@ words of land .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
in Berlin , the SPD of the survey , the SPD of the survey was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they remain behind the Green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in time : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came across the market .
the success@@ ors still dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather t@@ worth@@ less .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fers with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers still can buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age .
however , 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ phal@@ ia format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax was communic@@ ator to reach .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser if also agon@@ izing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be picked up like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euros .
nobody could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s lived an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market already dominate the market today , which came all much later than Nokia .
and to be online all over the world , which today is for very many people everyday .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold on Samsung and Apple alone , including 5@@ 55 million units .
the global sales with the machines is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the numer@@ ical app provider and the tel@@ ec@@ om companies .
around the smartphone has become a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , everything per touch @-@ screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s victory began , nor today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had to see .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the seeds now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after his invention .
on the average , each German now sees 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must learn to learn all the smartphone again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Jan@@ ina sc@@ oop , at the Siemens Board of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ then , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we are engaged in a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited by the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw new opportunities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will be able to create more than 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 40,000 jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ then is too big .
I was told that England never will be ready for the Games and that we will fade on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ g@@ ly wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to winds , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question .
the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 2@@ 11 billion in funny growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to leave both the airport and the whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has been implemented a £ 11 billion Swiss infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequented tre@@ ach@@ ers of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ time , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Olympics of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw expansion will also be one .
it is time that we will guide this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as build our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to which England can be proud of .

on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display loos@@ ings on his desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ post in which it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements in order to detect it scor@@ ching on what part of the site is advertising , to ag@@ grav@@ ate it .

woman at suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police calls witnesses to see after a woman in the early hours of the morning at a suspected su@@ icide was over@@ hau@@ led by several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a tail in the age of 49 years , that was over by several vehicles , including a truck , was going to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police that call these and every witness of the incident occurring to register .
it was opened an investigation proceedings , which is a &quot; log@@ ical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran on the highway on the highway - has been decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian moving in the middle of the night on the free@@ way , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the prop@@ ens@@ ed kill@@ ings was acqu@@ itted after they had been killed and killed in August 2014 one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , he accepted the court .
the court agreed that the poli@@ cem@@ an had responded to an emergency way -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report on the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable for the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still turned slow down .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably dis@@ missed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and also be protected from more ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ izes the slow turn of Venus its day @-@ side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to pull the surface of much of the sun war@@ ms .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously taken by Plan@@ etary Scienti@@ sts .
although they were probably inhab@@ itable , Venus is exposed in the course of several billions years --@@ a lot of heat and ultra @-@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned down from the ultra @-@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers again take talks on , putting strike off
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the compensation for North sea oil workers will be exposed while all the im@@ parti@@ tions set out for a new conversation at the table , they said negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes on the oil field service provider Wood Group have been conducted spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the process of current stretching process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some whole @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to begin the beginning of next year to tackle the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened to its contrac@@ tion in the North Sea for about 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the install@@ ment of the company follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities are ration@@ alized as a result of its meg@@ at@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower Cru@@ de Oil Pri@@ ces under pressure , a economic situation that had increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest jobs that have been working in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion will be spending money on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ations rate of stars in the star@@ ch of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ ding tel@@ esc@@ ope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full catalogue of rotation among the stars of the star@@ vation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data helps to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars in star@@ ry rot@@ ate at different rates , as well as in which connection the rotation periods with the planet development .
&quot; we hope that by the same of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s inf@@ rar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ tu@@ tion of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning at the fastest .
at peak rate rates , these po@@ ignant stars meet large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a bre@@ wing effect on the stars .
when a star opens , its rotation starts to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ations rate of any star by taking the time between the appearance of an recognizable star -- such as sun@@ spot -- det@@ ects .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the b@@ allet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Re@@ ull .
as the star@@ tu@@ tion of the P@@ lei@@ ades so close is it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Re@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still a lot more than we would like to know more about how , When , When and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rotation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ uries , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star turn off
the tears ran before Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball Star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional feedback announcement , the 41 year old pro on August 12th against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will last the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &apos;s &quot; to the &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the league , 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a tenth year deal has been compl@@ ained about 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez returns long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to perform some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays indicate only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be accepted for the 41 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was issued between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked up for 2@@ 11 games due to completion in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis @-@ sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main susp@@ ects for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez then sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days do not go no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; mad Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az , and with the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate Hudson , sympathy showing the fans from the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ v@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first Dop@@ ing@@ es
caught : because of a positive Dop@@ ing@@ probe , wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber must not start at Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - the Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing@@ es .
a wis@@ h@@ ful athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing in Rio de Janeiro have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ed in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacles from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the most critical athle@@ tic cont@@ ests , these messages are used at the time .
at Chen has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mask for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medals .
on Friday , Chen would have to take part in the footh@@ ills over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national Association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Chen full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio bl@@ amed the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the bot@@ tling substance for the blood @-@ dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was susp@@ icious , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should be a positive one already .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w turned into a word with criticism of the Ath@@ os .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the proper conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , about all weight lifting from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London Olympic Olympi@@ ad in the class up to 85 kg was tested , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been positively tested on the an@@ abolic stero@@ ids N@@ and@@ lon .
both take the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further difficult blow to the rep@@ utation of the whole sport .
the Welt@@ verband IA@@ AF had banned from the complete Russian team to an exception due to systemic dop@@ ing the start , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced in Rio many bad news .
in the swimming sport , the former associations in China had also taken care of severe conflicts between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ans Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; if I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun also stood at the center of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this one .
sun was positively tested at the Chinese Championships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din but had to be only a three @-@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge block .
Dat@@ ashe@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ et h@@ ackers her ran@@ som .
programmers of compres@@ sing mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies were surv@@ eyed over the past twelve months at least once , partly several times victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already target of a ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims pay tribute to the ran@@ som requested by the perpetrators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially pres@@ cri@@ b ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators of the compres@@ sor software are discovered .
only were private users had the target , but the change to company att@@ acken was start@@ ling in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final turn @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where in case of private users , the personal photo database is on the game , it deals with companies to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production tac@@ itly tac@@ kled .
accordingly , the damage falls from when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of affected German firms reported sales loss by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break up operations completely , in a case people were in danger .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the sacrifice always : does not pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult , given the dead@@ lock in operation the demand of the perpetrators .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers of F @-@ Sec@@ ure have examined the crops and the contact with the pres@@ sors and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free access @-@ free support websites or de@@ code for free example files .
and are private people rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must be partially negotiate and five @-@ digit figures to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky profits out of the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , explaining security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
it is likely that it is three or four persons .
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual black@@ outs .
the existing mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , solid price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ outs are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , you log in to one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is carried out per in@@ fic@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually , the criminals take the criminal with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that can rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware through file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful growth , the perpetrators instead explains the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the potential for damage depending on the type of data that is much higher than before .
the perpetrators of future will also be able to take up completely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ ney conference Def@@ con illustrated security researchers , how they could get involved with the internet of linked thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the de@@ formity of such a block could not be a ran@@ som of such a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block the heating in the future a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ du@@ sting
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V appears rather small , passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is there something off .
versatile vehicles as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ set and 10@@ 26 l with um@@ cl@@ ed back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ bank can be up like kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk space can be well loaded , however the load @-@ height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m in large rot@@ ary areas very powerful .
his work might be qui@@ eter somewhat qui@@ eter .
pleasing is the day @-@ to @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an allergy drive is not offered .
driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment shown in the top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; will not be desired .
one of the security systems belongs to the City of Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ war@@ ring system and the put@@ ties .
the coll@@ isions are irrit@@ ated sometimes , because in the ran@@ ates many obstacles as the &quot; her@@ ical objects &quot; assessed .
very reliable works from the remote light assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ e@@ gler responds to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ y when needed .
however , the full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch @-@ touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat awk@@ ward to achieve .
the approx . 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ appointed Top @-@ diesel are all right .
who does not want to invest so much , will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the motors meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and event@@ ful car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on air passenger
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is thin@@ kable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , argued the Supreme Court Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the down@@ fall of a knee br@@ ine .
however , the accident could have been happening all over the world - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay a damages to the man .
disease fall : when paid the organizer
having fallen ill vac@@ ation@@ ers after their journey only then money back if the cause of the disease is doub@@ tful at the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the acted case , a family was severely ill to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting the second day of its Turkish Empire .
she spent nearly all the holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the journey would have been faul@@ ty - and def@@ endant against the organizer .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff in fact was broken .
but the Organ@@ izer was just shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he therefore did not hurt his obligations , so the judgment .
especially as in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the illness of several hotel guests - wom@@ ens through infection with each other - belonging to the general rule of life .
about 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the refugees of refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state had to be bes@@ tos and decided to react on terrorist attacks at the same time .
secure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators of hate and split .
we don &apos;t allow this triumph over the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , increase the security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy .
a implementation of the proposals can be reached by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alisation of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ scale sizes over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should be back under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will become so @-@ called that mainly the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated .
the last much discussed welding for doctors is to be maintained following de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to search for solutions such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of mental clarity .
to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in the pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of inde@@ er investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of the double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of the enforcement of the authority he is responsible for constitu@@ tionally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can not ban everything that one re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the minister he wants to sim@@ ulate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and action capability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Chief of Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet sp@@ ans and a tigh@@ tening of the common right bring the man no more security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
higher traffic flows at the Autobahn A@@ br@@ inger
it is regularly on the byp@@ assing road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the de@@ ple@@ dge is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are on ambient road each evening in St@@ au when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then appear directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is dealt with early due to the overall performance of the course on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U group in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driving stops on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous from the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 PM .
week@@ days extends back to the bridge to the bridge over the Alber@@ t@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ clock on the B 51 shortly before departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is guided only one lane to the motorway .
the second track had to be restored well in a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had occurred to the bridge to no longer have the required load @-@ power to absorb above all the heavy @-@ duty transport .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated St@@ au will last , the competent state cannot say .
however , with years to count : for the bridge has an official remaining period of time up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the pro@@ long@@ ation of the de@@ fle@@ ction , the Landes@@ bank deliberately chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected .
the traffic is run on Tuesday and on Wednesday in the building site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s Club and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one gets forever awake , at night it is stun@@ ned for hours , in the morning there is no longer to think about sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleeping and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how can sleep and sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there may be many causes underlying , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , the board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping research and sleeping .
what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so a inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y disorder .
especially this can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , pre@@ board member of the German house association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it may be organic , mental or disrup@@ tive factors , but also medications .
not rare is the in@@ som@@ ing expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is mostly in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors are inter@@ dependent .
who , for example , has a sli@@ pped disk , can be badly wrong , guarded every two to three hours and ha@@ zy to p@@ onder@@ ing about day @-@ to @-@ day problems and -@@ ensure that there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one go to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who are not sleeps about a period of a month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised at the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look completely different : you are tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or bodily ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , amongst other things , behavi@@ oral therapy , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic bed@@ tables only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - un@@ questioned .
low @-@ level dormit@@ ories occur in Germany hardly , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University in Berlin .
that is why one should first turn to your doctor &apos;s physician first , betra@@ ys we@@ eping .
this can be resolved with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ?
for the examination in the dormit@@ ory , medical devices are used for example with snoring with respiratory diseases , in case of sleeping alco@@ ve , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y .
to prepare for the study you do not have to be prepared .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after c@@ abling you go to bed at his normal time .
beside the electro@@ des in the body one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling .
how can the concerned deal with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which one can bet for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping @-@ times , not too long in bed , on the day does not sleep , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night not to look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V teams in the Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he took the first gold medal for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler available via Facebook protective front of his in the criticism of the ex @-@ team mates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ad receives 20,000 € premium and one jungle is 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old during the night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls is very good .
by doing so , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see exactly the topic of dop@@ ing , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( N@@ ada ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent Contro@@ ls of W@@ ada / fin@@ a , must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the choice of Hamburg , which meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ anas of luggage di@@ ap@@ hr@@ ates
professional Die@@ be at the Airport Düsseldorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police was on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed as a ban@@ de several bags and baggage ste@@ els .
against 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang that was known for polic@@ emen from past theft of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences in the middle of July of this year and were collaborative , working and especially professional .
the specialists of the crime of Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can reject the th@@ ie@@ ves that were forced to go to Germany as a crime of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lenses , in the meantime a rest cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in appears at first sight not so , but the police are among them the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
go along the road from the east to the west , one gets to the places of playing , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten , and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already being built : until 2017 there is a house with large windows and 133 new flat rentals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called , however , in the last few weeks , however , preferred with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents have rented lease , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
in the beginning of the year Hen@@ kel , the Berlin @-@ Interior Hen@@ kel has repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and 94 as a base of autonomous violence .
having been on June 22nd the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ ds@@ mi@@ xes were given for three weeks according to 300 officials and three teams on site , closed parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13th July , a Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later went police and builders under the itch of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
at this summer afternoon the street works peacefully : parents walk with children walking , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others entertain pre @-@ m sp@@ ill@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there are primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
lef@@ tist force is not the protagon@@ ist of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * who draws up here three children , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern from rising rents and v@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a pine , who wish to wish several political police @-@ pl@@ ating on the left hand side .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berliner Interior and the Police between Haus@@ occupied and their neighbours , does not exist so .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today also has a low average of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city .
also house occupied and those born @-@ born housing projects are already part of the Kiev : 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all the Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under great police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga , and they are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and election lin@@ ers from all over the world : they are now sharing the inhabitants of the GDR &apos;s times and former house occupied by its jaw .
this is also noticeable in the rents that have been increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them by em@@ bell@@ ished discs or freshly coated faç@@ ades , which were be@@ amed with color .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours could see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body vulnerable , statistics thus ends almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make sense of damage , which tends to be rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : the people in 94 are their neighbours that are not intended .
even the famous burning cars had no longer place in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , their road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately moved to the Riga road and stayed .
therefore it was also so important that the residents get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claim the clarity of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by passing new buildings in former buildings that sup@@ press the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not accept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should be done , if someone is never listening to anyone ?
there are frustration on all pages , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for sco@@ oters who like to paint over color bom@@ bers , Ker@@ stin has a little understanding : the house@@ work projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
who runs , should be aware of it - just like someone who runs into a pubs area where noise can complain too bad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons with first names have asked to be called not to be called with their right name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee authorities for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical support team supports the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer from the working circuit indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ om@@ ch@@ sau that has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less spot@@ ted rather than on the multitude of desired tasks are pur@@ pose@@ ful - meant as the management wanted to write the spot .
he was searched for a administrative work with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a well @-@ founded Woll@@ om@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all it is a matter of organisation , working with local people on the ground and behind the scenes , as well as a network of power .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ oring and full @-@ time actors are supported .
there are large and small issues , organizational , human and dis@@ integration problems .
soon new containers are in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting people who have been recognized .
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you have to place the refugees in their own or rented residential rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative department to the Commun@@ e and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
so far it is not working , you should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be filed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm lead , they are tra@@ vers@@ ing , educational places , school areas , A @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and helpl@@ ess for refugees and migrants that need to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building or help house@@ master , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity means not just work .
the day need a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
the people would have to develop a lack of skills .
so , there are offers such as sports , contact with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so , we also have to manage the management and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful , for example with language courses .
who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , who will never be integrated .
the clear majority was motivated .
problem cases exist , however , the customer says honestly , &quot; folks where nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and client is therefore always to motivate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer really clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ tra na@@ ï@@ ve may call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko could and would not exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have been afraid that the assass@@ inations make them complete in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , principal and volunteers must hold on site and in the region after activities .
they are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
that question clearly answer , shy the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we are not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher consulting is busy already with the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them both women .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : re@@ bre@@ cher with helicop@@ ters looking for
