<seg id="2">In infrastructure we invest in infrastructure and avoid trade agreements, both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unone is the two US presidential competitors, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental request.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>

<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep a bit small in doubt and warns against how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to populate the economy to death and adjust to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, maintains Trump.</seg>

<seg id="10">Clinton against it says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, he has disadvantage odds and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes would increase to the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be invested in the must say Trump and Clinton almost wore alike.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nationalization of the Republiy Teapy.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that there are still no other internal discussion on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and drive coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-mining is also to be possible in so far protected areas to announce the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the contrary, Clinton intends to extend and expand renewable energies with its investment programme," "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade deal, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both of us want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The should be paid better then, asks for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase her at 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must renter, then he says, he may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand there is Trump that wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, so the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least demand from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of foreign lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Peter's Palace in reception, I can not repel the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the shake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles worked shlily and he was hardly a heat, even for its backward conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if never had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seems rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin radiant, sustainable radile showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his imaginary: the shutdown of a Russian struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was waged.</seg>
<seg id="15">He shared Putin and accused Ankara to have fallen back into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cousin of cousin is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long, the state-controlled media resulted in a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would carry the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations from senior officials who have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily necessary to get all friends that he can get after the last month after a failed coup d "état was almost his place.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey very hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are recorded again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the state television cheaper fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agricultural import will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulate it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because it's reaction to the tried to consider power-taking as weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the continued resentment against the blickentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike is to draw from the cool atmosphere and decrease the relation of Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader won in Ankara with security a bonus that he tried after the attempted coup d "état to the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-known for Moscow as a matter of course, which has itself a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present a analyst to portray "Alliance of foreign lateral": two countries which violate the West and feel poorly treated and now united.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be indicative that after nearly three hours of first talks, both Presidents were told at the press conference that they didn't even have to grasp the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey unintentionally promised to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open enmity - and in the face of the potential for a perfect discord, when NATO member Turkey intercepted the Russian battjet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin's chief leader Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his chairman Sergey Sergeov, Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrowest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as the special representative for the environment and transport of transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has arranged for reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012 Ivanov, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the prestigious State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is (in Russian) that he later Chief of the Chief of Governors and Chief Manager of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment," "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as heads of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcasted on Friday which Ivanov asked to leave his post and vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time among the closest Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a leader, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will return at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">What is the result of a kind of power fight?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once conceived as a potential president, at once the Russian environmental policy - came upon great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, giving me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complainable post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov participated the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia since Putin's second term in Putin's mandate against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion Swiss project should be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Norddeck of the Queensla Crossing with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four sealing of the" "" "covers" "", "which is the completion to approach each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, as well as 46 Schrägrope.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion Swiss project will be completed until May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the economic Minister Keith Brown, the construction site took a visit today and was one of the first to run from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "this is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the" "" "New Year Crossing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the slum between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a sensitive activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge is at her place and the last leg of the Decks gets a Betonguss for the Deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first reference represents a significant milestone in each of the bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project the clutter is looking forward-looking high-end and deep-mining.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road range and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to then close the existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an inclination of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, since the tolerances, on which the team works, tiny were - on each side they bore only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should really build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Green Party:" "" "who wants to build on urban areas will need 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build such areas at least 10 per cent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so viola:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants power for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, so Bratmann, bahns is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the programme is not entirely completely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built in any case.</seg>
<seg id="21">How is it balances in the loss of another around 1300-priced apartments, whose promotion will be run in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, as the planned spreaders in Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-running ties from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, it should have been designed to get back to the price delivery again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West city.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one stroke the problem can solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West town the end of the year is running.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners, the apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social flats in the West city has dramatically increased, one removes themselves from the goal of so-called penetration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been screwed during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and to be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games and finally limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that's based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later, a drawing series, game cards and other spin-Offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of Popular culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch of the market in other countries has been postponed due to massive demand that overlends the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon go even more users as Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players with their smartphone are outside and look for Pokémons that are followed up with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined Wahn and jumped for the lookout for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable rise in steps that refutes the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of market launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about "30 minutes" to get active "from the sofa," because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives sport regularly, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to bring them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also murderous toys, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and in doing so many people on hunting will help to be active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">They anticipated a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a last-dimensioned expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I put under the women's olympiamity in the tower and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Hernandez, who inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdine is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turners an Afro-Americanerin.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be a witness of the incredible performance of the triple world cup in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was unexpected, yet masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual Americanerin who won gold at an individual multifused event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We do not experience the top of this sport, but do not look like this in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five," because the next Olympics are only four turbines in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality shows that Turk is a dearer sport and turner is primarily maintained in private trainers who pay for the training, furnishing, travel - clothing, clothing and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of those sneakers are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the turner received its entire training and that is for the families a costly and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained both their athletes, since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, making an affordable and easily accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have offered free and affordable turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turers that will earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and for educational and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to look for the turbulence and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Duty of the Olympic Mannitgolds and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="8">Heart attack and stroke are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arteries, the siege form.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagcoror, which is produced by British company Astrazeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft design of NICE, which was released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technical Support Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="13">Thrilling is how strong newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalizable left.</seg>
<seg id="14">Celering, 66 years old and since 2008 Governors, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his large plings.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its peak candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two chancellor Angela Merkel to major contributors; Merkel (Bundestag) is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="30">In the election of 2011 the SPD had yet to become clear with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who buys actually records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men-aged men love hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you want to participate in the commentary in order to outsource it under the pseudonym non-sampled age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Youtuv, the resurgence of Schallplatten is not on a boom in millennials, who want to greet the re-unity of physical objects, but due to the midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are from any foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer-group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend their own time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">When this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I carry in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest turbo pull and wildly sluent before I steal, my hands hold and some determined things as: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart Sohos is slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic panel stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I received from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged men) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men aged men, a woman, probably the 20) succession, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and again buy items that he sold when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60ies, early 70ies who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things when I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy the plates are rather introverted and willing to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets to apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and arranges themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations that I have led, people usually turn off to their collection in 1998 or in 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of trailers of a given age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica in order to recognize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contact-free payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some panel fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of trusted sound drive, of objects, the happy Jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors, and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get mentally concerned.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flusks a staff of a record store." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player who will never use them while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while passing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works on sounds of the Universe (data number: three men aged 3) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revivals. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came only recently here and said," "" "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio plate, so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musiclasingly.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly coming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fstop that has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts Never synthesizer- and sexcpacker pop instead of experimental jazz drates out of loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them sees sonly lonely but naating mental traumas are difficult to imagine if one stands next to someone over 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes in the shop and considers the variation of the plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin bumblebee as a large one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is... "They are driving with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it truly is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the semblance of brave the jeans of jeans, watch a group of young teenager, who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think to buy a crosley plate player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grip them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research was taken to agree that the results of YouGov vote, they at least exist in records in Soho, the great number of female collectors and discovers, who exist in the reality, record business and in online fores.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while they avoid the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who overlooks over the shoulders of anything middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French dish rejected a proposal of the authorities in Calais, dozens of improvisational shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional business in which persons within the camp goods, sell cigarettes until Energydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be cut down, because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and that a firewall and the risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court with that the shops and restaurants are important, because the free meals that were offered by the state-made association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in stock.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional business, but admits that the concerns in the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is shared and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on Asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable children, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids "café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Dear Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji offers a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, postures, line-run and roher strength to win gold - their first Olympiad in any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost by the not too bad trophy of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they swallowed New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji on this form has been a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost Ryan of the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks GbS from a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell at and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went out 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack on the right hand corner that he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely saw the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hot runner from Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped in Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner has a touch-down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-beginning and there was still a minute game... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB conducted fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijib gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua ran Tuisova after a brilliant cliplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game worked for a long time in favour of South-income, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake and a further trial in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The puff hats, the fijis embraced and GB kicts crushing out in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the days Fiji Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 defeated and Great Britain forced South Africa in a scarce semfinalmatch from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with impressive footwork and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of English 15-aside teams, secured profit - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than in these games and that wants what to do.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first ruff to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter into the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was very present when she rested for the second Olympiagage in two without tax wife, the first women in the history of the British Sports, which laid such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least her 39.ter unloaded application, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that glides over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not the way of the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion to wilder helpers who make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach, who would survive 30 months ago, whether he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, could begin what the interruption stopped at a minimum if that is under such circumstances the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran out at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The herd of itself is already a challenge, but this makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmedibility of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervening in the morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Arllery regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It repeatedly repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for a better person or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm that could not keep up with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark closed, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let go along.</seg>

<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widespread in Wednesday, with reports from The verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat rushed to have the feature disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to be homage to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asiaten.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American people won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they can't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the American people are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition, and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place following their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first-burner will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game on Saturday may start, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after spending the past London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey layer in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went all wrong.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback envelope.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the game level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She accomplished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and lugs the ball into the gate around the American, a 2-0 guidance.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel inconsistent and inevitable, a rapid season between competition and pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the olympic torch would be a burning stunt, who is protected from wristening to swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeehop shop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Learty or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with grows, would certainly have been under this known name that would be sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-empathy TV if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fetters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame cannot be illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast and let it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may take modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline had already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had happened in Sydney there was the last 16 years so sparse that many that I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympiad species.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes, who made it to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsimile charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the most suitable for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremor of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, which combines two sports, which it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (dirt, headers and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are evaluated according to official Olympics, by execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and drover, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes back and back, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not only hunt the finish line or the wall, but in the television transfer also another cavities goal: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think even during the look of these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">The moving movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt from, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here prevails a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vault in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, likewise around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine the narrower as part of an afternoon bloc on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one which is probably overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness of consciousness can be achieved only by the anxiety and the classification of masculine athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently surges - then Mr Dooley awaits its after air rinks, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="3">Protesters to demand political changes in Ethiopia, they rose up to violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shedding.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook up the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot on an unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Taking the videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, are showing how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated to be the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopians economy expansive in the remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with the dissidents have been silenced effectively.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you press people and do not have any other options apart, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous discomforts that cover everything from the bottom line up to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After an extended election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions walk along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called for June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been imposed in recent years more or less, the turbulence could benefit and be rearming again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of breaking down the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very Ethiopians able to communicate with social media as cheap smartphones are becoming more and more frequent and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still communicate via internet Proxies who conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they gathered themselves so much.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orochi and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the eons of prospered the Amharas, who come from edics of predominantly Christian countries, in politics and economics, while they are the Oromos, many Muslims are living and live in flat-lands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemmou, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts around 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former grape leader, was up to his death at a non-publicident disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was especially versaturated in doing early signs of discontent and to use special teachers to edit opponents and to render them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians of new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Different from the Lord Meles who came from the Tigray region of Northern Albania, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the trust of the tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was experienced such a mover was 2005, after protesters were protested against the elections, according to information by analyst seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "development experts from Albania leaders for their visionary" infrastructure "" "," as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty. "" "</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, a amharish city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests in the USA and other Western allies introduce themselves to a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used to Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even though they recently concluded that they closed this basis.</seg>

<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabs wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York change is, then it is also a re-finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest cyclone is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland mostly comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get over with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland sharks along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is just about 1,220 feet far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates at satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this long-term life-shaped lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock that means for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although suspected the evolutionary biologist already long that Greenland become rocky.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers based on the lifestyle in Greenland know very little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-lupentine measurements they, when they expelled six animals with a transmitter in front of the Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot also make this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jaw of a young ice-bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunting they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the Eismeeres and are looking carcasses who torrents out of higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as Beige from the deep of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of ophthalmologists is already emerging before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, large quantities of this radioactive carbon carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters long, the linear animal contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lentists, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-Clock showed a 493 cm long Greenland at the age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters even 392 years old might be old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females have only then descended when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland has obviously at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vortices at this time.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in eisigen waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose bacon at the neck, a 120 year old harshenspitze put, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism is often running out of the animals living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and age-slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">One very big animal should in contrast invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio came down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technician Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sexismus- and Mobbingvores as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabitable for the projections of a new NASA climate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus is used with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and still turned slow down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably dismissed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and also be protected from more evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously taken by Planetary Scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although they were probably inhabitable, Venus is exposed in the course of several billions years --a lot of heat and ultra-violet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned down from the ultra-violet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datashelau: so perfide erpreset hackers her ransom.</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of compressing malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the Malware-defense specialists of Malwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were surveyed over the past twelve months at least once, partly several times victims of an attack with Erpresser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target of a ransomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims pay tribute to the ransom requested by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially prescrib ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators of the compressor software are discovered.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only were private users had the target, but the change to company attacken was startling in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it looks for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turn-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptonutrition Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in case of private users, the personal photo database is on the game, it deals with companies to sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production tacitly tackled.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls from when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German firms reported sales loss by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break up operations completely, in a case people were in danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the sacrifice always: does not pay, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, given the deadlock in operation the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the crops and the contact with the pressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free access-free support websites or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And are private people redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must be partially negotiate and five-digit figures to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits out of the ransomware-blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explaining security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software construction to the actual blackouts.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were created by the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, solid price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackouts are then looking for further hackers in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, you log in to one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is carried out per inficated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals take the criminal with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies-IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust that can repel Ransomware through file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful growth, the perpetrators instead explains the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing strategies," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the potential for damage depending on the type of data that is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators of future will also be able to take up completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackney conference Defcon illustrated security researchers, how they could get involved with the internet of linked thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the deformity of such a block could not be a ransom of such a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block the heating in the future a whole production road in a factory, Ransomware could also be an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday-dusting</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz, proves to be very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V appears rather small, passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the Fond.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant, only the cockpit-top is there something off.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-set and 1026 l with umcled back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical as it sounds: the sitting areas of the backbank can be up like kinosessel and thus offer storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk space can be well loaded, however the load-height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large rotary areas very powerful.</seg>

<seg id="21">Very reliable works from the remote light assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the traffic detection and drosy when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch-touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket are under armrest and therefore are somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approx. 29,000 euros for the well-appointed Top-diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who does not want to invest so much, will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets forever awake, at night it is stunned for hours, in the morning there is no longer to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleeping and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep and sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there may be many causes underlying, Hans-Günter Weeß emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, the board member of the German Society for Sleeping research and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is the insomnia, so a inhalation and sleepy disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially this can sleep many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagenknecht, preboard member of the German house association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it may be organic, mental or disruptive factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the insoming expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is mostly in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are interdependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a slipped disk, can be badly wrong, guarded every two to three hours and hazy to pondering about day-to-day problems and -ensure that there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should one go to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who are not sleeps about a period of a month in at least three nights per week and is compromised at the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look completely different: you are tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or bodily ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">Alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, amongst other things, behavioral therapy, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic bedtables only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - unquestioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Low-level dormitories occur in Germany hardly, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité University in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why one should first turn to your doctor's physician first, betrays weeping.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be resolved with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the dormitory, medical devices are used for example with snoring with respiratory diseases, in case of sleeping alcove, or if you don't find the cause of a sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare for the study you do not have to be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a midday," "", "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>

<seg id="33">How can the concerned deal with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which one can bet for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping-times, not too long in bed, on the day does not sleep, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night not to look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain is called, however, in the last few weeks, however, preferred with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents have rented lease, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of the year Henkel, the Berlin-Interior Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and 94 as a base of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">Having been on June 22nd the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterdsmixes were given for three weeks according to 300 officials and three teams on site, closed parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13th July, a Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later went police and builders under the itch of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">At this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children walking, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain pre-m spillti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist force is not the protagonist of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana * who draws up here three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern from rising rents and ventrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pine, who wish to wish several political police-plating on the left hand side.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berliner Interior and the Police between Hausoccupied and their neighbours, does not exist so.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupied and those born-born housing projects are already part of the Kiev: 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly all the Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been vacated under great police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga, and they are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and election liners from all over the world: they are now sharing the inhabitants of the GDR's times and former house occupied by its jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have been increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them by embellished discs or freshly coated façades, which were beamed with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours could see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body vulnerable, statistics thus ends almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences make sense of damage, which tends to be rather the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in 94 are their neighbours that are not intended.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars had no longer place in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, their road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately moved to the Riga road and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important that the residents get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claim the clarity of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: by passing new buildings in former buildings that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominium that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good," "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not accept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should be done, if someone is never listening to anyone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There are frustration on all pages, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For scooters who like to paint over color bombers, Kerstin has a little understanding: the housework projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee authorities for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical support team supports the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer from the working circuit indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the eiving Wollomchsau that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less spotted rather than on the multitude of desired tasks are purposeful - meant as the management wanted to write the spot.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was searched for a administrative work with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a well-founded Wollomchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all it is a matter of organisation, working with local people on the ground and behind the scenes, as well as a network of power.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honoring and full-time actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small issues, organizational, human and disintegration problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting people who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in their own or rented residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative department to the Commune and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not working, you should rely on private apartments, so Deule.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be filed as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm lead, they are traversing, educational places, school areas, A-Euro-jobs and helpless for refugees and migrants that need to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help housemaster, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no" "" "employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity means not just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a lack of skills.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers such as sports, contact with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, we also have to manage the management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, who will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases exist, however, the customer says honestly, "folks where nothing goes." the work of deuschle and client is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer really clearly," "" "what mantra naïve may call" "". "a Restrisiko could and would not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers are already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have been afraid that the assassinations make them complete in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, principal and volunteers must hold on site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">That question clearly answer, shy the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we are not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher consulting is busy already with the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them both women.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
