in a emergency , he conf@@ esses professor , his girlfriend
in a note , Professor Sh@@ annon was told with a somewhat z@@ ant voice of the police , that he has shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
he was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the funeral of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written record , which was put on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I really loved one , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that he , who traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , and already 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he took a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot and killed on the door of his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ cies Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said he did the ru@@ in@@ ous emergency sometime after that .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life , when the police burned him in .
one day after the shooting in the university , the students and faculty are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get an impression of what is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at the two ends of the state , as well as what students and staff , who knew him , helped to record an image of an talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were happy about their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history .
he himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both under@@ went in the department of Social Sciences and History , whose speaker are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some sn@@ ap@@ itations to problematic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who he praised , he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had asked the Delta State University to provide for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he was only direc@@ ting two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university is meant that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him , for which he would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to set up a Assistant Professor of Assistant Professor .
rich President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between himself and Schmidt , but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show . &quot;
these are questions that could no longer be answered .
after the flight from the campus , the police came later Lam@@ bs Track , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import .
before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said they believed that he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he was a doctoral degree in the spring in Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston told her was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her guitar playing .
he was then the woman &apos;s warm .
all the girls bare there , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on &apos;s .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the note , he said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning which was living with them in the brick @-@ house that was adjacent to one of you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he did not hit me , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and blues played .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged both on a summer @-@ year @-@ market three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter wrote and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ement coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he was able to stop he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5 September . he did not finish his guitar and harmon@@ ics .
there was no sign of anything that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the rooms and spot@@ ted each other .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the professor , directed the first semester seminar and specialized in American native and colonial history , Dr. Don All@@ an Mitchell said , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of its Brotherhood and of the students .

the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Journal Em@@ ily wag@@ ered P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were presented to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police declared he did the emergency , after he made Schmidt so much , and that lamb was described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .

UN leader predic@@ ts , &quot; There is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his reply to Russia &apos;s increased military assistance for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .

8 Re@@ frac@@ t@@ als , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks with surveys to the bottom , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask yourself what it means for the odds of nom@@ ination of the Estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody pret@@ end that Tr@@ ump will likely win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of whom only won a state in the Nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons for fighting in a general election .
but out@@ side groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative Economic &amp; Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps through stamina and start to let their dollar flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Bel@@ ieb@@ th@@ ef@@ al@@ ings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
around three out of ten tell you that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in the early states .
a Fifth @-@ vote in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ third of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans said they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be Nom@@ inated .
only two of 10 people say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he were the Candi@@ date .
only Ben Car@@ son will generate about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent ) , they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
what is the next in terms of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the Favor@@ it of Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would deny .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees p@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the Re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters , the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first preliminary state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for an commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his functions , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er is not pas@@ se to the White House , N@@ BC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put up their nest @-@ keepers , can be Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for Real .
if they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of the ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans said that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination by only 28 % for the final candidate Rom@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters are watching a plau@@ sible campaign than plau@@ si@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even if the Republi@@ can concerns itself to another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter field is likely to contribute to a l@@ umps , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority assistance .
he has before C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , recently 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally on edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only cont@@ est@@ ant who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their minds .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday reveals that only a little more than half of the voters b@@ ump will say that they have left their votes firmly .
of course , a lot of happening can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have made their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was named immigrants from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration and fishing point of the public discourse in 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic extinction of Tr@@ ump crucial Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the future @-@ oriented efforts .
however , after the new ABC / post survey of Monday six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , it is run by Donald Tr@@ ump .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , by its out@@ sider &apos;s status .
six of the 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post ; they would rather like to have a political ou@@ ter@@ rier than have someone with hands @-@ up experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa against two weeks showed that three out of four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can in Congress with 54 per cent &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; bel@@ ly angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive co@@ end@@ ings of Germany
here at the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg it is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North sea watt .
in the street , a square meter area will cost up to 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study is therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows which particular locations a square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really low .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top locations , comes the price however like pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service angel &amp; Völ@@ ders has published a list of the most exclusive German residential location - with square cliffs in di@@ zz@@ ying high alti@@ tudes .
there are several ten thousand Euro nix - per square meter , well @-@ defined .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
tw@@ o@@ fold Tor@@ ro@@ ud in Pir@@ ates : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ ined the FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign &apos;s start of the Champions League season .
the World Master Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have made a dream start to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ches V@@ aus and Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their debut in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympics ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th success project in Serie is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the Hen@@ cle pot@@ t in Munich .
Müller received from his 28 hits in the Champions League of Bavaria &apos;s leadership @-@ quality assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ s@@ Roberto which made an flan@@ k @-@ thought of the world of Baumeister .
&quot; we won &apos;t be underestimated , &quot; was Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ p Pap@@ akis , promised at 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the mu@@ ddy ber@@ ths held .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance , without gl@@ it@@ ching .
Piraeus had won his most recent six home@@ games in the royal class , among them against renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also played here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams have been defeated , failed to be the next victim .
they went quite courageous , with their offensive efforts , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous to work .
the attacks were too often introduced by the sie@@ ge on left @-@ outside Douglas fir@@ dt , who rarely came through against the former Braunschweig region of Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right side than its flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field in the upper left @-@ hand side .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half One had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown hit the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by Direct forec@@ asting , the Tor@@ s@@ Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although Bavaria has become the most dominant game in Bavaria , Pi@@ re@@ aus was advoc@@ ated .
at the door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er was lost but lost .
so about , when he set a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola sent a quadru@@ pe@@ el with David Al@@ aba in the centre adjacent to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ ste , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sporting @-@ standing Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ignant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he taught King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the an@@ la@@ ased Le@@ wand@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , per El@@ f@@ meter and Müller even a graph .
in front of the game there was come in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly well @-@ flooded Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block apparently had voc@@ ed the supporters of hosts Pir@@ ates with words and gestures , the security forces went out and went with drums to the Mün@@ chner pend@@ ant .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , makes it not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose your teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of international research teams , including several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tion@@ ists ( DI@@ RE@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ divers the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists were watching more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss would be tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth decay , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ RE@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors .
the connection between cigarette smoking and dental loss may therefore go back to frequent tooth decay for smokers .
not clear is the extent smoking increases the risk for tooth decay either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who listened with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat comes back to the level of non @-@ divers , ex@@ changing at Thomas Diet@@ rich , by the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people of the non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a recent Boeing of THE RE@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and brings to our knowledge also to a good dental health up to the high age .
more than 20 percent of the population affected by unemployment in Germany aged 65 to 74 were DI@@ RE@@ E .
earlier studies have already noted that smoking increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study tr@@ acked the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over the TTIP
the EU Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbitration system on the draft of the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( F@@ TA ) .
the controversial private arbitration institutions to disputes between concert and states are expected to be replaced by a transpar@@ ently system , which in its way clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trusted citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared the Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ TT has recently taken the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP must include the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings particularly pret@@ end that EU states and the US select independent judges for a new investment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; court &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
envis@@ aged is for the first time also a second instance .
it would permit it to raise against urine le@@ ases .
up to now the processing companies involved each other at the refer@@ ee , an objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments were not given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström did not enter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long run , it wants to work for its own information on an international investment course .
this could , for example , to clarify disputes between Chinese companies and the EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbitration institutions above all are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ers are being critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel adju@@ sters , concerning the companies contam@@ inate contam@@ in@@ ants of tax payers , national laws , or lowering consumer and environmental standards could prevail .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act accepted the proposals for the European Commission as inadequate .
it was critici@@ zed especially that they are not supposed to apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
German economic secretary of Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as major progress .
the Commission considered during the reform major points , the Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the leader of the Prime Minister
since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has been anticip@@ ating the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and set herself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is called Mr Cor@@ by@@ n to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance by the media is likely to be tested and the Labour MPs are expected .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns guidance , because after his appointment she comes to a member of the shadow wireless and his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hybrid during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in peace , critic@@ ises criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ gone Dec@@ ision , not the national hy@@ m@@ n to sing , has attracted attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; be@@ amed &quot; in a respectful place , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he got to sing the Labour Party , the National An@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns and they called for differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Parliam@@ entary Party was promoted to him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences will push themselves in the direction of Labour &apos; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limit of winning winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference to put Labour on to remove the whole idea of limiting .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ Work@@ y and R@@ ent Minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it would only be against the government plan , reducing the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , who David Cameron , since he &apos;s been the T@@ ory boss , in the last decade to go across the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in the parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy statement , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 responses .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that it is confron@@ t@@ ative the prime minister of the Prime Minister , and that he will have taken opposition to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr. Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle who is advoc@@ ating the shadow of Economic Affairs when it is not participating - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also brought up the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he began to discuss the problem of John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the basement , to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove itself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but , a few years later he acknowledged that he has failed in them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was presented with the Prime Minister as a major bar@@ ometer of the prototype of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his standing under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that it was become a caricature and an inadequate reforms .

pound is increasing by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose again according to data , which indicate a rise in the growth of the UK . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was rising through the s@@ ot@@ s@@ goal of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom has increased by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage has been the fastest and generated app@@ ra@@ isal at the time of a interest rate .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar based on $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and up to 0.@@ 84 % purchased to € 1,@@ 44@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Rival powered In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and put brands like bud@@ ger@@ es , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
the berry @-@ equi@@ ties were according to encouraging news from competition @-@ group for luxury goods ex@@ tras and 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales numbers hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining industry said that he has taken 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the greatest los@@ ers on the index , and with a fall by 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % after the holding company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would jeop@@ ardi@@ ze the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ pe@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing force does the higher labour costs in his company , says he .
the cost might meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer extra jobs .

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings the Lebanese of the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er @-@ Ide@@ a
potatoes or don@@ ors ?
it is both - and in the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , who has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ co @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat are put together to a mirror .
the idea was that he brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription of &quot; potatoes , &quot; they saw by chance on television .
since then , in its store it has been a gri@@ lled pig , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has since turned the Leb@@ ese in the meantime at the Patent Office in Munich .
in fact , according to the authority of the authority , it has been protected as a use pattern .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the s@@ ke@@ wers contains , Al@@ ha@@ y wants to betra@@ y it therefore .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
the culinary understanding also went well with his clients .
met@@ e@@ cash starts to act as a jurisdiction campaign to fight al@@ - fall
Met@@ z tries to protect Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ alen in front of an al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributor met@@ e@@ cash has launched a non @-@ fund campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ a@@ ign and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets are expanding their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ berg S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough as distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop owners , which sell tickets for the South Australian football game to loyal customers .
the met@@ rics is expected to take on further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices runs through its annual investors strategic plan .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia will generate almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A stores and generate higher profits as met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ networks in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A retailers come across a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analy@@ st like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets , roughly five percent of the food market in these two states is cut off and all the existing actors , but mainly independent retailers will take away sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 $ million can lose revenues per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis was based on the fact that Al@@ di will open 25 subsidiaries in SA and 30 in WA , with a turnover of 500 million of $ and 600 million in each market .
loss in food and food business and at the quantities at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s higher Fi@@ x@@ free basis could cost metals around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares loses in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ it , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley takes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2015 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , based on a business in Melbourne that met@@ e@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash refused to respond publicly to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has made contact last week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 % in 2012 , has since 2012 reflected growing debt reduction in turnover and margins .
the wholes@@ al@@ ers we@@ ars up however and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to collect prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ av@@ ths about hundreds of products every week and can deliver better fresh food products by increasing their stores by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label products .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and shop programs to El@@ an will begin to grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years again for the first time in four years .
Than@@ ks@@ Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian S@@ ands and Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ks@@ Kok@@ kin@@ akis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ ks@@ Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; Red Hat &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Sim@@ gios and deserved to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ op@@ akis , the youngest member , has repeatedly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; supported by the in@@ famous confrontation between Kyr@@ gios by St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison was going to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee that Harrison would have met : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have asked Gior@@ gios , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ quet , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f had failed to win a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ ain was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals on Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I did pretty much about it , is the fact that after my view of Than@@ asi was a little pushed into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a bat as he lost because of a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has bre@@ ached a bat of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances dealing with Harrison and so on , and I think that he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adap@@ ts to the team and so on , he has never worked a problem with the other players he is coaching hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ uns in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term basis to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick was very quick to climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he has some very bad mistakes and deserves all the critic@@ isms that he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary states emergen@@ cies , closing the border , holds refugees return
Hungary states the emergency and reloc@@ ated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everybody who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos was followed by the fron@@ tier , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a man @-@ of @-@ ha@@ ired and Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence prov@@ oked a unknown period of time in a land ro@@ ams on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents , and sat down there .
but frustr@@ ations have gone on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter about them ho@@ vering , the displaced people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the line ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling ins@@ ults against the Hungarian mass police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some meadows out of protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it &quot; unacceptable , &quot; that immigrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not any col@@ lateral harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence of the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations bloc at a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who in shr@@ inks Italy and Greece were looking for refuge . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary had not set his hopes for a long @-@ term action in Brussels or from his neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency jour@@ ner in two southern regions called in two southern regions more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could end road locks and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said the fact that his country would plan to build a bed dra@@ in along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after ending a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ on in the race , the sp@@ elled fence @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia could be used .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a major contribut@@ or for many war migrants from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a result of the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban did insisted that most economic migrants are looking for better life and non @-@ war migrants who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contra@@ dict other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or the damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws even place higher detention centres for condemned men &apos;s men .
&quot; due to the situation that emerged through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said government spokes@@ man from tan K@@ ov@@ ac re@@ porter in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen intense ar@@ ra@@ ging soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days already .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities met 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come across , to damage the fence , they are now in police winding and are accused of being charged with criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
the authorities are to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officers joined the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carri@@ ages with spi@@ der rods to close the borders .
chaos changed the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd around them .
about 20 managed to come in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons are in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l .
the former Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit edge in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ ander will win towards her .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders stood second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet declared whether he worked for the presidential Office , receives funding from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the commen@@ cement of the election , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ barriers can be more insur@@ er in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton is a big head of women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have less@@ ened .
your support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons is an advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 , and now they are at the same level .
but Clinton had a big head start with the older voters .
last month Clinton was a double @-@ story lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the for@@ election have a long say they would support Clinton as they would be nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 per cent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters is most enthusiastic about it , especially by their enthusiasm .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about one @-@ fourth would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak run by Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
if clinics are asked in an open question why they want them the nomin@@ ee as it is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton Sup@@ ported , also their association with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and in@@ toler@@ ability are also quoted .
as the Vice President has potential for the Office of the presidential Office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the fores@@ ters would have to see him in the race - though a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the elections , who would be the second choice for the party is Bi@@ den on top .
at Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half they have been their second choice far from S@@ ander .
deliber@@ ate bi@@ ds , not to vote for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton benefits from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second place in this measurement , but the percentage that le@@ an@@ ted it as the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important to a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters want questions about the constitu@@ encies .
similarly as in the last month , not a single democr@@ at candidate or potentially candidate for these voters in the for@@ election as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential applicants working good results at some of the key characteristics of the constitu@@ encies of the party &apos;s elections .
maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities .
bees cuts with regard to the three candidates most from honesty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it to him .
democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in alignment with their views .
in all of these measurements , some quarter of the democratic voters no think about S@@ anders .
since questions ab@@ by Hill@@ ary Clinton are using a personal e @-@ mail address and one server in the office as an external minister , most Democratic voters of the election are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in total .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem was coming to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on her general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion about her still pers@@ isted .
these are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trusted by the voters of their party as a whole : only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the vote areas are also called Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes at the helm .
of the six tested candidates cut Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty .
a majority regards S@@ anders , rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no idea about it .
the fault ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents at the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is close to the nationwide survey of Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is near the latest news from C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates are now falling half of the support for voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
re@@ public@@ can voters continue to support trac@@ b@@ ump in great numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , at 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
however , Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey was also concluded that Car@@ son received well in demographic groups and is p@@ aired with Republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Ch@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor of John Ka@@ itself , is shaken by Wis@@ la to the governor of Scott Walker , who is at the deepest on the last month .
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ es and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located at 6 % on the third place .
the BR compound in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus plus Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey conducted last week shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - he landed at 19 % assistance with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump sum of 32 % .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also highlighted Tr@@ ump before Car@@ son .
with a view on one last week asc@@ ended car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ herds for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump@@ kin &apos;s faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday while on a campaigns show in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood stressed by the death of a Bar@@ uch College
almost two years after a student in a schi@@ ju@@ ly ritual was filed in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , ma@@ ank@@ refu@@ te against five people .
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood took bru@@ k &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a single operation in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death .
officials said he had been stra@@ ined with connected eyes with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly been attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta PSI Brotherhood does not appeal to the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was powerless and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so police .
they had however the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , &quot; said Mr Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle over that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said accused Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died following his wounds in the next morning .
after an auto @-@ report , Den@@ g repe@@ ats repeatedly with mu@@ ters strength injury to head , torso and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the wars of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the Schi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable and this step by the authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge because of Mor@@ des &apos;s third grade for the first five members .
twenty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with pro@@ mon@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to take responsibility for the participating individuals , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or un@@ officially - this will we also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood has vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise raise comes , and the sli@@ ces will get into bed@@ bugs , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession .
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came after the first interest rate within just 11 months and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , though not always , one factor here as the economy and the financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on increasing interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could realize that the whole excitement was perhaps exaggerated because of a zinc rising .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ val at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at low levels in order to se@@ is@@ mic which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trends based look at how some areas of the economy might react :
as has seen the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates can make things more volati@@ le .
once the increase comes , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth income from 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , what perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after Zin@@ br@@ aces of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past 35 years , the market has mostly been in heat - roughly 14 per cent - on the way to a zinc rising , quite flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2,@@ 6 percent ) , with average rate of investments over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , Chief Executive Officer at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks can occur later in the rate @-@ cycle , and the return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest @-@ caves often encourage them .
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist and the recession could accelerate .
very remarkable is that gross Dom@@ estic Product is near its lowest point in a zinc @-@ rise in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , according to 118 , the total of 118 GDP has been rated almost 4,5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 exceeded € 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect the third quarter after data from Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zin@@ br@@ is at a so fragile economic setting would be risky and ask the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have agreed all year on a zinc rising by the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Thursday that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could gain an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading now only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all affor@@ ded cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and re@@ acting on re@@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ es very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; the report says .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has so far been 74 months .
the fixed gain also was volati@@ le , as the market receives a zinc raise , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact of bonds is faster than for shares , if they change their strategic course .
if the bonds appear to change the direction once the first raise / decrease is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the Earth &apos;s cycle the bond di@@ gs exp@@ ires immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will cause , resulting closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come analysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy &apos;s expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield market is fl@@ atter , lending have increased and the volati@@ lity of the market has intensified - all features of the market ag@@ grav@@ ated if the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large and whole companies benefit from the greater part of their business operations in the United States , from which interest rates increase and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are made worse , as an increase of dollars is making their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to respond positively to three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
firms with high capital @-@ ren@@ ces and low volumes of their shares also exceed their counterparts with low quality on average each 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debts are a big problem .
with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock market , consumers are also benef@@ iting through the increasing dollars .
savings can see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are , how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial rivals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they are only being im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed the programme The Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the sender , prove that it does something that does not do the private stations .
conservative members Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ Legal Radi@@ os@@ er said &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial rivals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I do not use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself into Classic FM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , shows The Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General showed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far off its commercial competitor if it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I am nowhere to learn from classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was however , not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , that during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports therefore under fire came under fire to step up the commercial rivals .
the T@@ ory @-@ S Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grab@@ bed The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC @-@ way .
he added that he would like the company &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time it started a lot of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from any ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the d@@ ag@@ it@@ ator for other instruction formats .
Internet turnover rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be held responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using phones for sale
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the expenses
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping mile in Britain have transformed into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are signs that the online transformations stagn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the onset of the record in 2000 with only five percent growth compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , that has become more and more developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , the editors of the IM@@ R@@ G and the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , when shop@@ pers started working with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now it sh@@ ame@@ te and we could possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is quoted as a reason for the decline in revenues .
experts believe that buyer will hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year saw five times the average number of buyers to make their computer , to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer @-@ websites were imp@@ elled .
experts believe that Black Friday , to which the buyers were batt@@ ling for bar@@ gains to stop buyers for shopping .
a study conducted by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that a total of 5 pounds with a little more than 1 £ were spent online .
according to some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people are bought clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion jewellery shops .

the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funer@@ als in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia reveals the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis Bin Laden group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the killed , killed as a crane to Me@@ k@@ kas grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .

among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was in Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who had been on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the great mosque with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great mosque .
Saudi officials have already argued that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mecca with thousands who continue to go to town .
today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin @-@ Laden group would not have taken the arm of the crane , when he was not used .

the English @-@ speaking service of the message agency reported this detail not , said , however , that the leadership of the foreign language would be prohibited .
in the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man instructed to un@@ veil the overthrow of the sick , who plung@@ ed into a courtyard of the grand@@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims began before the H@@ add@@ ling that happened later this month .
the Bin Laden group has no such statements regarding the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the King decree was also re@@ proo@@ fing the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with Meteor@@ ologists .

the Bin Laden films have been linked with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and has more construction projects .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen are tra@@ vers@@ ed at
British deal with increasingly crafts@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this leads to the fact that 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim at craftsmen , can be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales rise wide
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favour of the use of qualified CE@@ D craftsmen who carry out their work in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush for an infected one , you seem to be considered a minority nowadays .
after all , British increasingly employ arti@@ san , to carry home jobs in their houses , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the chain mass chain , said that a big increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , who offer services to deep @-@ forth prices are now outdated .
that is why , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which turn to tra@@ des@@ man and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women at B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by women .
at the moment ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that will perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this more strongly towards a balance .
in principle , half of our customers are made up of 80 per cent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who has been one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has dict@@ ated its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only enterprise , which has occupied only 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her recorded a fall in the mid @-@ year profit and the paragrap@@ hs , after the group collap@@ sed the costs for the closing of the stores .
because of its trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is open to 200 new branches .
functional by A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the provincial council Kla@@ gen@@ furt have to turn on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball department . A@@ I / DO@@ B had to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and down@@ stairs .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in May of the final .
the current process has been failing .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel had emerged in preliminary examination , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 have been disp@@ osed of the accounts used in their functions , used for private purposes .
the damage will be more 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports function is also charged with financial obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this fact divi@@ des the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
on the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the Defence presented that the association at no time emerged as an asset manager .
the sports function could have been compensated only for allowance for use and the sports club to have invested between 1982 and 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the liabilities carried out in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 s@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or block we ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ el@@ f Large @-@ bustling city of finance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to undertake this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have used money , laid down our lives of life as safety during the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it must just be made no debt .
furthermore - in proportionate financial - success the payout of the documents is postponed until 1991 .
therefore , one portion of the allowance for only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account un@@ paid .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ form@@ ulations also did not form a l@@ ump and not detail @-@ bookings , explained the former Ob@@ man on the proceedings .
the accounts and savings run by the two def@@ endants were jointly , said the second def@@ endant .
why the pay@@ outs made the society were not in detail in detail , the judge asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for financial results , if only the debt of debt has been so important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as opposed to the official investigations of abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were revers@@ ed , said the def@@ endants .
this publi@@ can was found on the name of the second accused , and was not known according to whose statement the association was not known .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
on that the b@@ asks for a long time not been answered .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the association .
when something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money he placed the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the space .
the co @-@ accused did not have been informed , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been formulated as &quot; claims of redemption . &quot;
why claims of claims ? , wanted to know the judges and the prosec@@ utor .
on the contrary , the first indic@@ tee , he had not been in agreement with this formulation , because the association never suffered a damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent content , he merely charged o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
on the acupuncture , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expense was much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years could not be accused of accused persons .
these may be judged correctly , in which everything had been judged correctly , and no longer preserved .
kilometer post also took the second def@@ endant .
all those j@@ eb@@ ies are in cash , so that he must go to the bench from his place of living to the bank to St@@ ain@@ burg , explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Pack@@ ages more 30,000 jobs
in addition , for three years of continuous recruitment , the computer opponent is continuously expanding the company &apos;s performance during the continued development of the company .
the actu@@ ation orders of the US @-@ computer@@ ised He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end an end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate clients .
as a result , cost of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) shall be saved , sharing the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special rate of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the last three years .
HP was employed at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year 2013 / 14 .
next , the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares were 2.3 % after .
the company with printers raised from California &apos;s Palo Alto today turns at the present time : thus the computer and printing business will be pool@@ ed this year in a new society - separate from the promising fields with computer pen@@ ders and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business lines should be listed on the stock market .
a again dis@@ appoint PC @-@ paragraph , as well as a weaker demand of corporate clients , according to its services the world @-@ largest PC @-@ maker for Len@@ ovo is last .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers had declined by 1@@ 1.5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent at just under 25.@@ 4 billion .
thereby the revenues went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP has responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive positions .
the 76 @-@ year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man responded late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and keep doing business online .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 points in total .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct involvement of German soldiers on hos@@ tilities in Iraq would , however , mainly arise against rejection : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent were appro@@ ving .
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will find positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , would be 20 percent .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Persian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has installed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and J@@ lights against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k did not experience the threat of violence at the border inspection at the border inspection .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees collap@@ sed the limit .
behind this a police line had shaped and behind the polic@@ emen was a water@@ front .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to cut off with stones , st@@ ov@@ ens and plastic bottles after the officers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the officials at first put uninterrupted pepper spray .
after that the police over@@ took the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn something now .
a pregnant woman and apparently the last woman was carried off from the zone .
children who had absorbed the te@@ ah@@ as , cried out .
other refugees ch@@ opped in themselves together and suffered under respiratory not .
the press secretary of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ gn@@ as and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US p@@ en@@ bank
the world is observed whenever the US Open Bank is arriving at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is risen or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , which was still last week of view , that the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to persist a little longer , and the interest rates will hold on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank would leave the zero region and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; says Angel U@@ bid , director of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good service level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate just low inflation .
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ tive outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to increase on increasing , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
Death Ro@@ cher on the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later walked on the day his colleague and killed - Sh@@ annon wrote a notice in order to say he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; they gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he , lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number to 10 : 00 am Monday morning
and said , he was shot upon someone and someone killed .
he said the staff of the emergency number , that police officers must send to his home .
he said , &quot; I W@@ oss my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , yet &quot; no one will dis@@ rupt , &quot; but probably will be upset .
the police asked the call@@ ers to his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
he did not have any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written record of Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted it , I might und@@ o it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , he took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he had E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police killed him .
rich President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between himself and Schmidt , but &quot; obviously there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs show . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , which did not believe that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there are &quot; no information &quot; for a &quot; Trinity &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divided 15 years ago but friends stayed .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and was destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss her daughter were &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , after statement from L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , having met him for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that relatives have called to a particular time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen rose on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he was driving his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 he received a doctoral degree from Delta State University , as he gave his lifestyle on the university &apos;s website .
stars , who lost their god@@ par@@ inger
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stressful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his many years of partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also supposedly has repor@@ tedly fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was condemned because of drug owners .
all of this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of corporate restructuring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half a billion euros per year intends to save Lufthansa alone with better organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
150 of the around 1000 executives will cost the workplace in the working environment .
with the pilot trade union there is a new negotiation .
the Lufthansa builds on its corporate structure and values the low @-@ level Euro@@ wings on .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to profit of some 500 million euros a year from cost @-@ borne and savings , the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things , there are no more directors in the German future for the passenger business .
the low @-@ fluid Euro@@ wings sol@@ le should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
the board team led by Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr to the future of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be in charge of Euro@@ wings in the future .
with the new position , Spo@@ hr underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet plus .
the organization of the 120 000 employees has so far been complex .
the portfolio is operated under the umbrella of the passage Air@@ line Group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of about 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
the collective bar@@ row of the cock@@ pit of the cock@@ pit ( V@@ IC ) will be scheduled to resume the negotiations after the straigh@@ tened strike on this Thursday .
that shared the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control system for pilots .
cock@@ pit wants to achieve a projected investment result as quickly as possible to load results in a year .
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ line has led to several strikes in the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition from the pilots the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it faces the lifting of Lufthansa in fighting competition routes to the group @-@ owned low @-@ level Euro@@ wings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play monthly because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven .
while this brought the left recei@@ vers to wines and en@@ circle it out for at least six months of play , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double string and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then is awesome , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws log : &quot; I thank all of you for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I get stronger again . &quot;
here@@ to referred to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
with the European defen@@ ders , the British Defender has an additional incentive in France to recover until the coming June .
Phillip Co@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves with this sort of injury the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno Ru@@ suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland for the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched it &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you get it almost in@@ convenient .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite has to call his favorite ch@@ book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax was decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the company of the company Super@@ Camp , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to have a picture or a message we have never missed . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly described the act of the book , instead gives a summar@@ ize the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a merchandise , hopes to win a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to meet his desire to see a real tree , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el lau@@ rel and the 1991 passed , however completely unknown .
as if this was not yet deserved enough : the text being presented by Cameron is somewhat like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is going to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the act of the book as little as the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ y , trees , sn@@ acking , sn@@ ak@@ y beings , &quot; which in the name of the trees speak , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR function was deleg@@ ated to one hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ k said that the text was probably come by Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
super Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees but was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res that has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series is not on my map .
I would not shut out a sp@@ elled victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page could possibly be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin@@ offs in the Batt@@ ting placement , and the collective spirit is strong ; they will not take s@@ cars of 2012 just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
thereby , related message : Adam Ly@@ th is depar@@ ting from the England test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as Chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critic@@ isms are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination when - and I said these things - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago the run of Ly@@ th was extended , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he will hopefully move further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not offer such good performances and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test key is given to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ eth received seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton nine received .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and move .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England was first pic@@ tured in the Caribbean in the Caribbean -- when Ly@@ th was in top @-@ form - but this lost chance has now been in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a head@@ set that I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ factor @-@ cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire , early in this season when he showed 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place that met us very much .
it must receive at least the same chances as the before him , but this of course depends on the team &apos;s position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mor@@ een in addition to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler achieved and four j@@ icks , deaf , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a tags can &apos;t hit there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious tom@@ cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket player .
Mor@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but has been a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests during the first drop before he entered into the Open@@ er 2001 .
he immediately made a hundred eyes and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited view he has very impressed me as a young man .
people might see their statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there &apos;s no large number of backup circles that raise their hands and the coach has chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Re@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a champion .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and force@@ ful use in the Setup then .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela presents insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously agreed .
Col@@ l@@ ys mate @-@ mate with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot gave a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team@@ building do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as players are dependent on their jobs .
such decisions are not made easy with the heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is running into a f@@ lu@@ te for by 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed new conversion strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper trouble with every day , even without the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour and TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at and said that some member states , so deeply caught up in various crises , such as the EU has now , and not always from their own fault , in Britain itself created agenda with a split and disturbing contract changes , which they mostly do not want to be filled .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not like it if they threaten the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers have climb on Roma or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants a look out in the UK in the interior of the EU @-@ tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - und lets out that more and more short @-@ sighted minister and officials have reached the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cautious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it is bad for her , as for the exaggerated do@@ dging operations like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande looks at his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a stupid force .
Poland has soon soon nation@@ alistic right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that if they can tear a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British to help their energy better to prevent their energy from leaving the UK - something which they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers may even have deliberately not helpful notes , entirely in SN@@ P @-@ style , during the U.@@ K. styles , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , assumed my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street should be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , as they were carried out during the Tony Ben@@ n inspir@@ ational speech late 1975 , but which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the al@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who have made a name for itself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU t@@ anning ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with all his cra@@ z@@ iness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
that belonged to med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sho@@ vels , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ end out@@ men and the pseudo @-@ Indians , who possess most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Blair is similar to it , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , one should put better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ erian than Blair herself , when he dis@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Blair had rejected the treaty established by French and Dutch voters , which opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it with a back door .
the press has never passed it to him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on the back of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need to spend time more for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , but strategy of 80 @-@ er years , a mistake then and now .
it may take , but he has to develop coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I make it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps , traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ fuel tendency and the wild@@ cards of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness , everybody can say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite , &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the sc@@ outs in him strug@@ gled , provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ years , when his old father is engaged in television making loyal to his Labour cabinet , loyal towards his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight , to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ es expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , but what J@@ C told his collaborators and parliament@@ arians in spite of all the reports on their clear@@ ance on Monday night .
whatever the touching sign @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even has stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of the Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
there is correct to give Cameron no open @-@ card for Europe that allows him to hold lab@@ ours support in the silly campaign for a natur@@ al@@ ness , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ ulation economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esot@@ eric discussion , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is uns@@ ha@@ kable that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats are committed to trying to find in all a sense of their supervis@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander political capital - they also interfer@@ ing with susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British if so can all be useless ?
the United States are already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even having a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of what was reminded of the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was .

claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking . of a meeting of 12 people , partially with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write to the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined The Lanc@@ et to critici@@ ze the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Properties Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y foundation , &quot; where p@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations took place on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the cont@@ en@@ tion of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ bed decision @-@ making analysis ( multi @-@ c@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damages of different nicotine products into a synthesis ; the findings of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting agreed to obtain funding from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not the funding he intended to obtain according to reports before the previous Tab@@ ak@@ company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not shipped , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons which some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco was also attended by p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products for most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; claims of p@@ he that &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes could serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at PC@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence shows that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to are low , but that we continue to study the long term effects .
p@@ he reaffir@@ ms the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger regarding tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0.000 people are dying every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion £ per year .
by clear proo@@ fs of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risks , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rivals &quot; could give their right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itter .
he critici@@ zed the BBC to make it public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time window against the most popular shows of their rivals and by channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company was to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or sends , which were also clearly presented by non @-@ subsidi@@ zing rivals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you wish to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider over medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least make your production on programmes that others don &apos;t make or give on commission .
they send the Voice in a prime time window , because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , it &apos;s natural nonsense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to them .
I &apos;m compelled to see how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , which led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe it is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC include that which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one does not measure quite the audience , but they may argue , when they are going to their head@@ sacred missions to justification from 4 billion £ circular fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ scure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window of window in which no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the circuit , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ ression system in terms of conditions that may get the best value in this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember all , we think that one receives a great value for 150 £ a year , but for those who money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they consume no much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also told the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; educate and entertain . &quot;
he said , little about BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public @-@ legal tel@@ ev@@ ines in Australia and Canada .
the question of partnerships said el@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like most of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television can be demonstrated and with the commercial Sen@@ ders alliances in order to make everything online available .
&quot; Son@@ o@@ Get &quot; can control bra@@ in@@ doors by means of sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they will be sm@@ aired with sound @-@ impulses .
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified organisms , that can be controlled by cle@@ fts of sound waves .
tiny Nem@@ ato@@ a@@ vers are changing the direction of the moment in which they have the sound impulse , that will have high frequencies for human hearing , to be heard .
the impulses work by switching of mot@@ on@@ lin@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels , which respond on ultras@@ ound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms demonstrated the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ suggests , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ e@@ kan@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain , a invasive procedure which gives electric impulses into the brain of humans for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ o@@ stly do not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani spot@@ ted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bl@@ isters , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , that then inv@@ ade into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves act on the structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ on@@ channels and can be found in the membran@@ es from some of the wor@@ ms cells .
the sound@@ waves make the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells in which they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to manage ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des , the Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms to wear some of their mot@@ on@@ ers TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
if an ultras@@ ound image applies to the changing creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ particles , and transfer them to the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed motor on motor ons .
the process has several similarities with its tan@@ to@@ on , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to entr@@ en@@ ch neur@@ ons with impulses of light - and turn off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Get could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , low @-@ rate ultras@@ ound waves can happen and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that using gen@@ otherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the aimed human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and the Carto@@ on images leave no doubt that this ad is produced for the world &apos;s largest weapons fair , launched by Am@@ nesty International , en@@ o@@ lic@@ ing the willingness of the British government into the spotlight , to f@@ lic@@ ts weapons to the Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bor@@ ee to the Dock@@ lands in London Dock@@ lands .

Am@@ nesty International was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non@@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who also works free of charge .
V@@ C@@ CP @-@ creative director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the still@@ ness that reigned around advertising for the ce@@ ase@@ fire - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic t@@ wi@@ d company inheritance , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the unic@@ ast with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping them to raise awareness about selling illegal torture practices at the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is an inclusion of the British government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ter@@ appliances are not being illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for the life of student residence
eleven years ago , I moved out as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still belief in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense mur@@ derer which I upset - and to the numerous , long @-@ related complaints about others .
most of what I have learned may be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the ind@@ ress of student residence is enough from slightly nerve wr@@ acking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come in , where and when you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you &apos;re in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite does not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , there is just a pi@@ ec@@ extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to figure out the people that you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would rent in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also places where people wear themselves and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
in response : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ts receive a crude treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going forward , but you need to go away so that I have saved the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a class@@ mate is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of knock .
speaking of speaking , do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclude by b@@ aking .
as you begin the Uni , at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to conceive themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years . welcome to the neighborhood , I have something to bake . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats , is a good way to make friends .
your fellow occup@@ ants feel obliged to entertain yourself and will associate your face with a delicious surprise in the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor mixed ch@@ un@@ ks of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping , if you want to anchor .
ste@@ al foods is a common crime of student residence .
of course , the cl@@ ad of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check the with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they bo@@ il inside the interior .
if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added their milk an dish@@ wash@@ ers to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
it is now in prison .
they should not make noise , which keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in the glass @-@ house .
a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , if there is anything about to turn to it , drum and bass anything qui@@ eter , because at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to the music with still older music .
when she finally listened at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbors kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse accidentally moved to the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t have been sm@@ ur@@ ely awk@@ ward if you get a room@@ mate for your future mar@@ ital partners to separate them again and then have to experience it every day and maybe experience how they came up all common friends ?
of course the heart goes its own way - but if the hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future mar@@ ital partners , try to talk at least to your abdom@@ b a little reason .
at the upright moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ folded room , the boundary between a v@@ k and bullying is one than it seems .
a good stroke is fun , but it takes only moments until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give them a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t neglect couples each room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you should then put in the freezer - but then t@@ ack@@ down her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ ear@@ ing ear@@ ners
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid @-@ border town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need the living room , but also the mother @-@ serving mother and the righteous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to buy cheap and good even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the home market .
the entrepreneur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the low living space can be created : he builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , a lot of refugees will push for the home market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : a massive accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen have no sustainability .
because people stay here to a large extent .
in the light of the refugee flow we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three storey building is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
that is different if you put the people into chal@@ ets .
each of the six houses , which are built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three housing units each for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be changed according to their respective needs .
what are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living per house is about 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without any property .
this is quite manage@@ able .
six months has taken the building .
this is reasonable .
do the building rules have for@@ ge their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : un@@ wise I have gone through my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the most im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ar value special building and the slot directive .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
there will still be subject to who creates three apartments in a row , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities are missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants re@@ acted to their Town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who chose to set up a luxury building for asylum seekers .
things definitely not right .
but ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we have been a construction boom in Germany during the last five years but they were built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ serving mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners .
I show how to make cheap and good building today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple &apos;s update will be released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , to &quot; Android , &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have pushed questions after the installation , as they get an error message informing you that the &quot; software update has failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the issue , users recommend either to wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to make room - but Apple has made it easier through the scr@@ am@@ end of the updates . similarly , it will be simpler to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is close to a charger , allowing the battery to be loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not leave that the update will continue , because the telephone may possibly split up half way and bring it to an abor@@ tion of the update .

Qu@@ arti@@ san@@ Eye looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the sister Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have assembled themselves under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and on the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square , was opened a new starting point .
besides consulting there can also be available in courses .
the social foundation raises it down from the mountain to the city center .
more specifically said on the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Square .
there was recently opened a new arti@@ san office .
here , directly next to the purchase market , obtain sen@@ iors and advice @-@ looking information on questions like to care insurance , or to benefit from the medical and nursing care .
for years we have been established with our out@@ patient care service , that often nursing homes can be left alone .
there are immen@@ sely lots of questions .
&quot; neither rarely many achievements of the payers are not used , because the complexity of the insurance company is barely understood , &quot; explained the new good@@ will in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ans and the citizen as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
beside the consultancy , the new accommodation design firm also offers prevention , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ di was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as nose@@ dive , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the deals of the sen@@ iors and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal manner .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precaution and re@@ hab .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , chair@@ men of Sal@@ u@@ di .
the foundation for the opening of the new building project office in the city center will see both business leaders in the demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) at the initiation celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ san did also dedicate itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alising line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the social foundation guarantees a large contribution , that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their trusted environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ p office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice field , and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ting ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a meeting between Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz und A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field .
during UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ting on the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing in the next few months with a half point to the side .
after a construction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first glance that Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who res@@ igned their medical practitioners in the dener hospital and who also want to get into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the id@@ les would fit well into practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ting and laughing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple of Müller ar@@ ded the idea that in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf the idea was to pursue their own practice .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ Year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we would like to see and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he will soon see his own boss .
and so you agree , the trav@@ eller bought the house with the practice .
live they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the two @-@ time family father Frank Mu@@ eller , as well as his medical studies in Hannover ensu@@ ed stations in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ â@@ tel .
he is currently working as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , he was ordered in 2009 for the leading emergency physician in the district Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z and is engaged in volunteers in the DRC .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss is prepared .

&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after conversion , the rooms will appear more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and exposure to EK@@ GS and need a consultation room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed .
the trav@@ eller in the context of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro have been reported the trav@@ eller as part of a promotion programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality of the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed the deb@@ un@@ deb@@ ated master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter come into practice at the field of Fel@@ ting , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf an additional general practitioner &apos;s office is available .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ taking by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains loud at UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ se@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , she would have gone .
those who attend the Mü@@ llers are still looking forward in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fel@@ ines .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have worked there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms &quot; re@@ mind@@ ing UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
a little sad@@ ness allowed her after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is comple@@ mented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed in front of gardening , so this could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the couple has two grandchildren and they like to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also high on our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dom@@ minister@@ ing Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application , which could also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stood in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clear is also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs significant signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept un@@ restricted migration flows , neither on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled operation .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia wants to continue traveling to future refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also implement cor@@ ridors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , this Minister of Minister of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however did not see however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia rather than Hungary on the border - intensify . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the border with Croatia , the border with Croatia has already been sharply controlled .
as the secretary stressed , it makes it possible for refugees to post@@ war its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member has to fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ hol@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , to pass in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to exp@@ ire the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the near math .
since then , according to local media , we ever meet police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is primarily related to Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead , his country had around 4,000 refugees , said Interior Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo sent to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously taken migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media responded to by Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is possible to suggest people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either we can , nor want to do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees had arrived in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , where further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been travelling the whole night of the 500 kilometres distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police have said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
it is now actually possible to actually displ@@ ace the displ@@ ac@@ ement of the previous Western Europe @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers in Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ised that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , corresponding plans for possible proportions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he not called , but he pointed out that Croatia had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full potential &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Schengen governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since 2007 , the EU partners have gone through a good testimony as to what concerns the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ if side , there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der &apos;s report they would have spent the past night at the Border Cros@@ sing , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border @-@ transi@@ tions of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely un@@ locked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was temp@@ ted to calm at a local spot in Hor@@ gos : he stop the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
at present it would not be a very high level of refugees .
one can still not say if they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
auxili@@ ary immigration to - dangerous - aging
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute to the refugees in which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the country &apos;s country , there are also still un@@ paid min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ders was sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result re@@ mixed , financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant report his contest for a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo handling and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ sourcing service .
the company also told that she plans to recru@@ it about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the stock fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which finishes in May 20 is less than in the earlier pre@@ diction .
analysts expect a survey of a fac@@ t@@ set of 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the increases , which are average of 4.@@ 9 percent and , on January 4 , are effective and despite greater mounting for bo@@ bo@@ des of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company also expects that the result will be increased compared to the prior year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gains &quot; solid yields in order to take into account the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holidays employment became announced one day later than the one of the rivals U@@ PS , which plans , 9@@ 0.000 up to 9@@ 5.000 additional staff , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August ended F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ones Investment Research asked the analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of interest accepted analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported in recent years a fall at international Pri@@ ests des@@ patch which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in its unit Express @-@ shipping .
however , the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit awarded higher income due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo store .
in the market @-@ market , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spent two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the benchmark interest .
dr@@ one on them at an end of the em@@ bell@@ ished , two @-@ story sitting room is located a m@@ ural in the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues are supposed to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order of Congress : improvements of the US @-@ employment and prices remain stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is a idle third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to become an unprecedented incentive for the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy show that it will be solid , recent turmoil in the global financial markets its already more cautious F@@ ed representative will increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest to government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ists at Mak@@ ler@@ ton Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I guess if she were looking for a pretext to not raise the interest rate , the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself in the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently interviewed were predicted recently by Bloomberg , have predicted a substantial rise raise this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indication that will show only a 30 % chance at an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike , by promising that further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average score of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1,4 % at 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the campaign was established through expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy maintains a sentence in this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ b@@ ent@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets so that they do not panic at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise raise would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate insecurity about when the F@@ ed would act .
even before a month the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow @-@ tigh@@ tening stage that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required to raise a sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed regards as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and while inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effects of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ val in Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world were together at the end of the last month , when China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Society proved by more than 16 % of its maximum levels in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would increase global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , whereby the Dow is now almost 10 % below the Ho@@ ch of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market upheav@@ al influences the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past couple of weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Rho@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Not@@ en@@ bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will be waiting for at least a month to better control the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the global economy health is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end @-@ effect , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has grown enormously in recent years .
the mere reference of the former leadership Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed can be able to close their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &apos; , sol@@ vable con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ mixed , the F@@ ed representations are expected to monitor the developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Art as Science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell said leader of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey W@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of survivors on financial market movements that appear to be associated with the economic fundament@@ alist data .
t@@ acker , voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates for a zinc raise , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to shed by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the USA , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed represent@@ ants made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market of mar@@ ital entry in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent turbul@@ ence cannot come close to this level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly wants not to get into the situation where she &apos;s afraid of a plant raise , because markets are upright , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still does not contain the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be busy time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe für refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
welcome to the warm welcome , does not go without the engagement of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ ein is with body and soul teacher .
even with her 74 L@@ encies they are taught still too .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum @-@ ber@@ heim on the D@@ ill@@ inger road .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course this is quite a different lesson from being at the right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to elu@@ ci@@ date women on sho@@ cking women how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fat , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers will get rid of increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher percentage limit was not the only di@@ ä@@ te@@ tic adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ate to the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new am@@ ber of the sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the entry application for 2.3 million euros and sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long awaited rotation building on Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent con@@ council session the processed building was agreed upon without major discussions .
previously , the Advisory Board had thus given an application for a legal legal &quot; exception &quot; to the accepted &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form of building construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is therefore planned to build a &quot; se@@ d@@ ach with non @-@ moderate First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing this we get a wonderfully large South Dalmatia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn out again around the a@@ version , which is different from energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; relief &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan with regard to the a@@ version no &quot; exceptions &quot; - in which the am@@ ber @-@ council is generally rather restric@@ tive in deliver@@ able orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , at the turn@@ building it is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs of some EUR 2.3 million are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots initiatives .
in the next process , the application for the 18 x 36 metres high hall now has to be presented to the Land@@ mark Office for the exam .
Klinik St. ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is expected to be closed sooner than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these see the un@@ ending plans of the hospital GmbH of the land@@ en@@ circle , the land@@ en@@ tin Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
however , a decision on this should be taken by the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ ing of the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority sol@@ ub@@ les to pull off with fishermen and in the farther existing inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the collaborators who cannot work with after Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the staff are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to hospital .
according to the question , who is to follow the succession came according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , which was prepared to take over the leadership from 1 October and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
Fischer is a specialist in pac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
as a result of the next two years , fishermen are expected to agree with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees to meet both houses , until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y Act , which still has 35 beds , finally shall be closed for nearly 140 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the county seat had planned this for 2018 , if the current refurb@@ ishment of the hospital is closed in Wei@@ l@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites , who also is the chairman of the Supervisory Board , res@@ ent@@ alled that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ y , in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close together with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ white could not say , there are several reflections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ haz@@ al psychi@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; what improvement could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; says fishermen about the Qu@@ asi relocation to Le@@ ch which had been &quot; positive and very understanding by the employees . &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where fishermen work for over 30 years as chief @-@ colored , I did not give it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the duties of the medical director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened over the past decades under closing , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ etri@@ cs .
the hand@@ cra@@ b of all of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar Lion are called tonight ( 20.@@ 5 p.m. ) on the Min@@ t HC today .
the Bundesliga of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal certainly is the clear favourite , but there is none at all .
in the last season , the bad@@ ener on B@@ HC taken a sore defeat and have a good chance to make up there .
Jag@@ dun@@ ce with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tr@@ actor @-@ ists have been badly injured during their sor@@ round@@ ing afternoon through shots .
during the Aber@@ n@@ aire on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action as the police shared .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could get to the incident was first unclear .
the det@@ ective police was established .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of non @-@ violent crime
a pa@@ edi@@ table has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave to the youths killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a long @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is out of a non @-@ violent crime .
the bodies of the young woman was found by the evening evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday afternoon .
as an enter@@ tain@@ icious one also is regarded as the Tuesday evening taken by 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who gave the fact the announcement and the investig@@ ators to the loc@@ ale of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not arrived home on the eve of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the autumn evening .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators arrived at first personal bel@@ ong@@ ers of the victim .
for surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the Ver@@ mi@@ est , he eventually found a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the ump@@ tuous perpetr@@ ator brought the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
the fortress gave the authorities to the police to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be conducted on Wednesday the Haf@@ tri@@ ser , the investig@@ ators put him a hom@@ icide .
a decision about the near@@ er circumstances of the action are to carry out further inquiries .
refugees need accommodation : study warning against over@@ l@@ der
the location on the German apartment market is tense .
ever more refugees are seeking a pay@@ able place .
the pressure on the apartment market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with incoming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more and more people push into a market that is now busy in many big cities .
you compete with a few weak citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
this result will come from a study on behalf of the de@@ ple@@ tion &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
to compare , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are finished .
this makes 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer obligated for the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in a first week of accommodation .
many come across the apartment market and stand in the long queu@@ es before the flats for rent .
according to statistics tables in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have to rent .
the negative development of the housing market lies not only to increasing refugee numbers .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in sur@@ ve@@ ying policy of the last few years .
Germany sho@@ ves a deficit of residential deficit , which is getting bigger from year to year .
currently in the ag@@ glomer@@ ations already absent from 77@@ 0,000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals , therefore , lived in big cities with penetr@@ ated in W@@ G rooms .
young adults remained un@@ optional because of the F@@ lau@@ te for the apartment market no longer in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the large cities the number of square meters per head was dropped into the past few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start .
and new incentives to stimulate the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the dis@@ armament tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments will be suspended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , according to our alliance attractive tax @-@ free shut@@ ters are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funding programme for refugee status of the State Bank Kf@@ W is a good result in cities and municipalities .
it was a good week after the start on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million Euros , more than half of which were already available around EUR 300 million .
this project could be even extended .
refugees have free conduct : Croatia and Slovenia become a corridor
Hungary is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the road about Croatia .
Zagreb announces to give the transit of Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
nonetheless , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to become an agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian internal Minister , and if it is necessary we will arrange a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian @-@ Minister Ran@@ ko Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had rounded off its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which entered into force the same day , make the decent asylum process in Hungary in practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatian police imposed the first refugees on the border of Serbia in Croatia in the morning .
most of the media were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and Ta@@ xen in the Serbian border area of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot .
there is no border to the Croatian border in the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the Border pe contains other dangers . there are still sharp blocks from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ e@@ zo@@ v is fast creating a safe passage .
today hardly any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police were surv@@ eyed with 3@@ 66 .
briefly before fol@@ am on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws will cause the overcoming and damage of the border to us as a crime .
thus 35 trial proceedings were initiated in the T@@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the refer@@ enced arrest warran@@ t up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration office , one began on Tuesday in the newly founded &quot; tran@@ se@@ onen &quot; a total of 94 asylum entries , including almost all - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are included .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped .
practically nobody has a prospect of being given asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ on@@ ated asylum seekers are supposed to be scre@@ ened there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we met only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to regulate .
they gathered the trash , which tens of thousands of people over the last weeks left at the road@@ side .
pl@@ ot@@ ra@@ ils were dra@@ ined and one of the re@@ group@@ ings in the border area has been modified .
for the purpose of this re@@ building , no one wanted to express .
Austria is just a few refugees hoping to close the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants talked to government information but still in the country .
around 1400 men are waiting for the continuation of Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning before the German authorities &apos; instruction .
in bye , smaller groups of refugees arrived at walking .
Mayor went &quot; sailed &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy at the bridge festival on Sunday by the meeting , when suddenly ten people with rice were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said leaders of Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprising the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , was the same for her in Wern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ th@@ ful@@ ler immediately looked up with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the river N@@ ahe Pass@@ au .
before we brought the un@@ hoped guests only once , with jam and drinks .
we said straight away , we bring her to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says coun@@ t@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to commit a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ th@@ ler .
the train@@ ee @-@ passengers were driving on Sunday evening in Wels on the Saturday evening in Wels to an regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , to put it off after the short notice that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still about the border to try .
but the regional train was stopped at the Inn in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein , this is a cross @-@ border in general that is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fast@@ verband with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday are soci@@ able , days before a two @-@ mosquito @-@ sp@@ ill - organized by the Union of Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further fu@@ sions to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ cr@@ atic policy :
rather than in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately to help the establishment of structures , our German Chancellor was highly advanced and publicly decorated with the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark @-@ circle of the Nazi regime .
loans of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border zones with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they too must learn that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ liter@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they have been invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great challenge , given the sustained refugee flow and of the approaching winter , in case of decent conditions for the seeking protection .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria maintain .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 win@@ ey@@ or quar@@ es
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee movement .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen ban@@ kers to expose the bul@@ ls for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first Ap@@ pro@@ val Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten the handle of Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ fal@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast the Interior Ministry was speaking of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it expects Con@@ rad with an increase of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ es in the He@@ ur@@ ry year .
to satisfy the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations will have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries as € 15,000 per the Con@@ federation .
should there be more refugees , we can manage it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the people of the county .
these would have saved him for the upcoming refugees in Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP of the Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be classified as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F @-@ Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform we can offer customers fir@@ sth@@ and accommodations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides , one hopes on hotels that are empty in winter .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er yesterday critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in emergency times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must respect a certain height of the hand @-@ holder , or size of the secondary duties .
a valid time would have to apply &quot; extra standards . &quot;
that in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in serving patients with his experience .
I am an older gentleman who cannot be lived without another face to face the fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs as they said themselves .
your staff number will want to increase in three to four .
this encounter was so far not successful until now .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the square at the office as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz to create a better division
not far the opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips , and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
at the moment this is not necessary , as the persons involved can exist without those measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emergen@@ cies , other sites shall be tested for their fitness .
criticism of the chief town on the partition of the refugees within the state .
other areas too must make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a long phone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef Sche@@ inger ( VP ) acts on Monday for further action in the refugee problem .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer told me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
however , there is now even the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special deduc@@ tions with refugees in Germany will not give it for a first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the polic@@ emen would have brought to Germany with regular trains .
among the other EU member states , he once called for increased solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria once again leads to its borders , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the course of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production , the listed IT @-@ group S &amp; T is drawn down , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is said to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine , to invest in star@@ tup firms in the New Wer@@ ft and later on which barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the start S &amp; T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours - which is reflected in the country : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the site 3,@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ center , each one with one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is far@@ med by the Linz AG for 60 years with S &amp; D as well as the Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters radius in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent will give it inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of attention .
actually , J@@ utta wanted to develop a dog for himself .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old ink of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon @-@ market ar@@ cades : after all , they have got gains in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sold under different pockets , cases , shoes and clo@@ cks of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are starting from 75 Euro .
greater bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
previously , several weeks has been modified .
&quot; but I wondered if I should open a shop for a long time , &quot; says wide .
decisive for the decision was among others , that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are in Bologna , from the idea of an own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the sav@@ our@@ y in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots .
her fashion interest has got broad from her mother to the cradle .
it is best when something develops and I can show new trends at an affordable prices .
why so some woman has the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into timi@@ dity , the specialist can not respond with last security too .
perhaps it is due to that a beautiful bag is upgraded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump joined in a town whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ver .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US President wants to become .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fication .
whether it is alien@@ ated to xen@@ opho@@ bic forces , journalists , or scientists in the international crisis policy - the applicant seems power@@ fully en@@ forcing the electoral campaign .
and cut off well with them .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property with milli@@ ards originate .
the New Yorker with the Butter@@ flies is a major theme in the winery &apos;s village at the Wine Trail .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ resident village is related above -@@ many corners with it .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers think about its aim to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow fascinating , but in her ten@@ stad@@ ters kind they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native mate has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , that is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the asser@@ tion that it surely would be successful if it would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
for the king of the hearts he did not come there .
while there are respect for the performance of the family , but they also tended that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big Moor@@ ish , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rand@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , says them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather had emig@@ rated and opened up a pub for Gold Rus@@ h .
foundation of the real estate Company , was the first property sales in New York .
but the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy : your desire to return to the country , failed on the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Pf@@ alz belonged then .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Ga@@ el@@ ic history and Folklore , Roland Paul , explains to the film@@ start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a contrast to the sometimes distinctive statements of descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and called for the construction of a border wall to terri@@ fy illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ arization , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives Tr@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a n@@ born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borrowed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winem@@ akers in the retirement sees the American rather distant &quot; he is always so miserable .
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I can not imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ ber@@ wir@@ t Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm mentions , as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz served with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make it better if he didn &apos;t make the choice because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had the seeds at the time of his grandfather in the US , he would have been like him , &quot; he would never be there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ken@@ nel Sarah Bol@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been interviewed for long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ son @-@ singers , also in the US to wake up interest .

today , a slight increase compared to ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but his number stopped behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in the last few months .

this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from packed to the Raf@@ t Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recent twe@@ et , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and suggested the Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17@@ h30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ C@@ ee@@ fe , which was an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decrease in the quot@@ as of the second evening from The Ch@@ ase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that it does not manage to sur@@ mount the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
to be revealed ? ...
L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who the Bachelor is winning .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally landed , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not di@@ vul@@ ge whether they are the one who received the last rose .
but when we went along with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before you checked out of three , you might have accidentally given a reference to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday . sealed
all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ ric way , why wood is the perfect man , and called for it his sense of humour , ambition , family values , and positive attitudes as reasons why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who was the final rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the face of the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki sc@@ anned both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from that moment when I walked into the house and noted ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies noticed that they were rather compatible and I thought it was in the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ wel@@ ons &quot; said .
&quot; Sarah is facing two feet on Earth , it is so fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam would be well suited as pairs .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the home one last week was to realize that Wood &quot; could be &quot; The One . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I have now ceased to go to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked what Wood was to choose when not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls in equal measure - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that will send inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some trainers would have banned from Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a jo@@ ck@@ e@@ eing , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Conver@@ ti@@ t at its first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed its true colours in the locker room after the game .
instead of re@@ treating his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened it even publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams Co@@ ordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ron@@ y catch and worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled in a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first district of Minnesota
it was certainly not the start , which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flight and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a lower start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was something that now happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ n performs the car@@ vers with his Ori@@ gin God@@ head back then in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al region led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are demanding the placement of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high income of refugees .
in the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Fall , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W fall , in front of a serious crisis on Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no need for the many new pupils : &quot; we need at least 1000 extra teachers to keep the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free elec@@ tors by Friday in the sub@@ terranean Commun@@ e .
actually , all other major topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free vot@@ er meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the topic of asylum is covered in Klau@@ sur , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria , the way they gave them during the Nazi war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it does not go any further , we need to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Zone boss .
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also required more personnel for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ ee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need common uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we must be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in big flas@@ hes is not supposed to fall under the table .
a years of experience in bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Robert spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has launched the pilot &apos;s intermediate step plus , for an extension of the E@@ asi@@ al intermediate level of three to four years - as a result it will take nine years to high school .
but this is not far enough by Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W leader .
we call for freedom of choice for all higher level schools who want .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion about the burdens from the nuclear phase has turned the shares of RW@@ E in time to a record time and also behind these deep marks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Spiegel &quot; the German energy con@@ den@@ ies might be missing 30 billion euros in return .
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies began to recover as a result , but ultimately to 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose on D@@ ax &apos;s top by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. Ambassador magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was released from weekend to weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors of the German chip@@ maker currently attract too little attention .
in this context , the investments in future @-@ oriented w@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus should be paid to the automobile market .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shooting on demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police were trapped in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , called a be@@ amer at Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader district , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside a police station , with some of them burned stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then poured into the air before it hits a rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets known by those who may kill them , but they traditionally used as less deadly , apparently such a high death rate .
the struggle was the last two weeks violent protest in Nepal as the southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ati@@ i say that new provinces , that are formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been killed in violent conflicts since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement that divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 was on its way , but the legis@@ lature had accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ator voted this week to vote in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the plans for the holiday house at the Small Sea with Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly presented publicly plans for the project .
quite a few lie@@ ger are still worried - they fear the sale of their refuge .

now the plans for a new holiday cottage are located near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized German company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday to the urban development committee of the Em@@ pres@@ Council .
originally this point was not standing on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , the investor @-@ management from the company management board entered the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the members of the association and more than 50 visitors .
but it was good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million Euros has been in discussion for months .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come to the meeting had emerged the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member in the group of stakeholders , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all the other structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he fears a few other project critics that the traffic would be greatly increased by the intended size of the plant : &quot; there all need to travel all the bus@@ hings , so that this is reck@@ oned , &quot; says Schulz
what is exactly on the well a hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept behind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was even lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the donation of the donation through his blog .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful in loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery can be longer than those who do not receive non @-@ surgical treatments .

weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .

BMI , a degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24@@ ,@@ 9 standard .

for the new study the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min Sh@@ eng General Hospital Personal , that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach ul@@ cer and stomach ul@@ cer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI between those that under@@ went through this surgery , from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BMI with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments was roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , the diabetes is blown up at 36 % of the diabetes illness and partially at 28 % .
in comparison to the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is reduced now only at one percent and partly with only about two percent .
moreover , the results were better in the checks of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , are the researchers writing .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
but in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not mortality rate in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also lik@@ ened average results in the two types of the surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Ga@@ ther@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery , after five years , there are evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was at obes@@ e people who have subjected themselves to an obesity operation , to die roughly 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ assur@@ ing to people having a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in that lower BMI group , &quot; without higher risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with the BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , conversion is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not include all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and then imp@@ lied that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide urged to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford that focuses on trials .
he urged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries has been admir@@ able towards the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts in managing the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; addressing several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved those problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the USA moved a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put authority one , and that has brought forth unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of load @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 % increase in number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ low alcoholic ben@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so that Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues from hand @-@ infectious agents in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more often in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in an emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally drinking , while some do it to impress their friends or for a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ thful inf@@ ect@@ ants eat only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly used dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash so as to obtain a tougher beverage .
younger children can be attributed to attractive no@@ ons of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ed .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange pe@@ els which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can be a few sp@@ lash @-@ poison@@ ing to alcohol .
&quot; it is highly concentrated of alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison@@ ing centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would leave no sip whis@@ ky but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children join it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl , which recently had four spra@@ yers of after straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ es@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school was brought into an emergency .
their blood sugar concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to by adults by law as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , which surv@@ eyed at the G@@ win@@ nett medical center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ itt@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors killed it overnight in a separate children &apos;s clinic in the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and thrust the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and san@@ iti@@ zer to the reach of the child .
moreover , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the gor@@ ge@@ y of ham@@ dis@@ inf@@ os , who contained an toxic , un@@ equ@@ ated ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contains , a deadly remedy , rather than eth@@ ylene co@@ hol , who was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class were elected in the State of New York , their &quot; so@@ aking &quot; teacher , by saying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it &apos;s a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to bo@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their room .

it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .

you are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .

D@@ ei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we need to go on .
we really don &apos;t need to support Celtic because it makes players better .
standing together is so important .

why I become a witness to an Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is ex@@ po@@ unded by the poison@@ ous .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked myself I agreed .
when the day came closer I began to fear myself .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be able to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applicants than places available , a more macro@@ economic lottery is held to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
who is selected will be so emoti@@ onally attached .
I cannot do so .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ est , I will sit with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telep@@ hon@@ y and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebooks and a pin to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it and you will get access .
I respect me with her .
she adm@@ its she was &quot; to put it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I said to him that he can remove myself from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter was present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting beside me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to any details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his acts after the assassination of Barry Van Gogh would make him guilty , an beneficiaries of the deed .
but I believe that a strong probability that he is not guilty of the murder .
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pi@@ fy him and threatened to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that the ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables in the past year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity of the Racing Victoria and claimed that her personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ i led to the last straw on Wednesday during the last straw .
Moo@@ dy &apos;s Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ test in Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see that it looked like too high traff@@ ick@@ y grapes . &quot;
&quot; I recently had nothing to say about it and I have been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are frustrated that everything is out at a time , &quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s .
they know it was far @-@ reaching .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about the main walk and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m trying to do my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not , then I should not be a trainer .
I then have to consider what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy was the bom@@ bas@@ kets in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ator Department had tried to au@@ gment its cow@@ shed .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a husband - which I will name , when I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they clearly believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly stick to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to hold me down .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ s , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were already aware of this time and are still today .
should that bring me to the view that it is personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L celebrated his cow@@ ard@@ ly and maybe does people outside the coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying is now to think about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fruit levels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the coach have been established with the long @-@ term cob@@ alt investigation on Li@@ dar@@ i and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching did so that he could throw &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his license on the table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ brid@@ led master black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race days of the race track is &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack@@ et or sound had been imposed on the horse debate , which ran against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ ged mud on the leg .
it could have been the last night .
it could have been the whole day , whatever was so .
but there was also this on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a dre@@ im@@ onic dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that reson@@ ates again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights , when they met us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year nothing has changed on our defensive system or the techniques . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tactics to a real main focus , and this has been undertaken for us at the turn of the trend .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not to lose accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is quite funny even as this time emerges in this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and recalls its ment@@ or reminded that Ben@@ net was won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he played his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was being considered a te@@ dious team , and Way@@ ne said that he would take care of a sc@@ op@@ rot@@ ate .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you would like to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as this .
I build a stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about gam@@ ble against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy refers also to the game of Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ zes to cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was a good game , I didn &apos;t see it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make points of tension ?
for me it is the maps .
if they mention us it means that we will still meet them in a phase .
the Storm team set free on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the pre @-@ finals at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales starts starting next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit after drug control
a man who could possibly be a lifel@@ ong punishment due to his temp@@ ting to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine who were mug@@ gled up to Queensland to be released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police took 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endant in the afternoon during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police took 40 kil@@ ogram of the drug in a Toyota Ech@@ o .
despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic had no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been from a harmless scenario .
Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Re@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in the prosec@@ ut@@ ary , he lied the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the most genuine explanations for the two people , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ f@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being afraid , warned him .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , announces itself in the police daily and joins a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : the Bau@@ haus team gre@@ ets
at a rear @-@ end with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry drivers had been injured during the evening .
two of the three participating trucks had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent seat in the direction of Basel .
the third rider noticed it late and tried in vain to so@@ ften the last moment to the left as the police took .
the leader of the accident profile was completely separated .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely blocked over six hours until 2 am .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl , when this slept , made himself in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he got a series of in@@ decent images sent by children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sle@@ ep@@ y H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through her , found the confusing message and aler@@ ted immediately her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research using the terms used for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g seems to have claimed that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the net &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poli@@ cem@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ ie Robert@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he gave too that the searches on the computer have been carried out from him , but said it be done because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an , to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , he said , he wants to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robert@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the telephone she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mb@@ ling and we@@ eping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the telephone and made the def@@ endants .
the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endant will be used to speak with girls who looked much younger than him .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty on the meaning of the indictment , in@@ decent images of children ch@@ ased on 14 June last year , and not to have appeared before a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence attorney S@@ in asked that H@@ og@@ g is not in the Register of sexual pro@@ pen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no major sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his failure is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael conce@@ als whether the judgment dates to October , to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case deposit , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other still remaining cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was taken before the date of the judgement in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; List of sexual offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
locks new to small border @-@ transi@@ tions to Germany
more and more refugees are attacked by the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left out of fear of detection and arrest of men more often on smaller border @-@ borders
on the Austrian side , the spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the Bor@@ land Hotel &apos;s Bor@@ land and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been picked up more than 1,000 refugees in the coun@@ ties of the Bor@@ land and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were walking on bridges and shr@@ ubs on the German side .
they will be taken in reception by Bundes@@ police agencies and rel@@ ayed to registration .
at the Munich central railway station , the Federal Police according to Federal Police were again clearly more refugees in comparison with the weekly start of the weekend .
alone until 8 : 00 , approximately 700 people in the state capital arrived , said one speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : emig@@ ration from Tro@@ pic@@ ana &apos;s Henry &quot; in the southwest
Meteor@@ ologists warning against stor@@ m@@ o@@ en in the southwest of on Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low pressure area above the Western Europe current , warm sea air currently divide the country , the German weather service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with a low pressure area .
the vigor@@ ous Deep is the prec@@ ursor of the Tro@@ pic@@ ma@@ m &quot; Henry , &quot; that was drawn over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands .
fierce storms and thunder@@ showers are expected in front of everything in bath .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday morning even in the Black Forest , on the Sch@@ sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see @-@ Circle with Bo@@ en from 60 to 90 per hour per hour .
Friday is again to be looking longer up to the sun again .
the mass does it : every two years , the auto@@ bahn at the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is especially active in the compact car cars which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly sought after : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of the new appro@@ vals were dis@@ missed according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new secondary and luxury cars , this year will be presented as many new compact models this year .
one of the biggest premium boats for the German auto@@ bahn is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be available in autumn by dealers .
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ Chief Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
thus the volume @-@ volume model also sold well , the new A@@ stra does not get much more expensive .
Opel is an entry point below the biggest competitor VW Golf in the prospect of at 5@@ 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the A@@ stra can be found with a new 1.4 l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 PS .
in addition , the Hessen also offer additional diesel systems and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 PS to 147 kW / / 200 PS , to which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engine exists .
unlike most of the most important competitors of VW Golf and Ford , the Opel A@@ stra has only as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible on the IA@@ A .
and what will be done next to the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Medi@@ gan@@ e : Renault was the fourth generation of his A@@ stra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a fifth one in a conventional and one particular emphasis on the sporting GT @-@ version .
in the trade it comes first next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
it adap@@ ts itself to the compact infin@@ iti with its curved lines fully into the brand design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with petrol engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ l@@ iter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is by manufactur@@ er@@ ases with 170 new@@ ton meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in the spring of 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely re@@ done is the compact model DS 4 , which is to be seen on the IA@@ A .
out@@ war@@ dly , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n derivatives wrote in particular hand at the front@@ plate : here the cooler has been re @-@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play is integrated .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class a number of re@@ adap@@ tations and new variants as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cells are deserted
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Ap@@ pro@@ val Office of the Ap@@ pro@@ val Office , which served each month in a small cell .
because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
it was the Federal Constitutional Court issued in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the persons , they can even hope for the money if they were locked up only a few days into the spaces ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successfully delivered in Karlsruhe . he was located in the judicial process of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a detached cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separate .
after that , the man , who , according to the law of his lawyer , was now again on the free walk , laid in a larger cell .
his arrest warran@@ t because of the un@@ worthy occupation of the country Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court de@@ parts the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and presented the case for renewed examination .
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber treatment now decides on the amount of compensation
although legal reasons of the questionable period only a few days of trial days would have been decisive for compensation , be a statement which was written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a fu@@ elled of the legal protection of the personality to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Chamber must now clarify the amount of money &apos;s damage .
the Constitutional Court in the past often have reinforced the rights of prisoners of war .
so they said only in April of a prisoner of conscience because he was being imprisoned in a cell naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is due to a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ loading of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe formally confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed upon a in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ case in November 2009 with decent accommodation .
the then @-@ pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had been possible for three months a day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in the last weeks as well because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore repeat@@ ed@@ ely closed 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ vity rises , even to pun@@ ches , it should have been due to the tense situation .
after information from the legal sors , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior men , 19 will fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seekers are brought to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Defence , this year , according to vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated to face the un@@ resolved challenge : &quot; I tell you again and again : we can do that , and we are creating that . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
following various forecasts range from 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , but above all on affordable properties : annually from 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from rent , and around these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Foreign Minister , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double its promotion , from now at 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social flats annually would have to arise . the federal government would have to invest 3@@ 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
the scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for housing in the housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugee @-@ seekers in Germany can take in the long run .
however , the refugees in Germany would not at all be asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the reception company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Diet@@ rich Thr@@ ace .
according to th@@ ief , Germany in Germany gave a political turn : from the work@@ ban for refugees to recognise work .
while there was an employment plan for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Residen@@ z@@ le , the asylum seekers have limited to a residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - mostly the view gained that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
so far there has not been an outstanding offering of general and occupational courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often given through personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ oti@@ onal view of the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few parents survived their children to the kit@@ es , estimated 10 to 15 % : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oting parents it is only very important to hold the family together , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ str@@ bar says , spokes@@ person for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
therefore , to convince the family nevertheless the advantages of the K@@ ita , distribute the head@@ line in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators should rise strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - e.g. by increasing training .
in the countries students are prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes .
but they are not always instructed by full trained teachers and teachers but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
generally , no Federal State asylum seekers or Ge@@ patient tolerated the study - the only exception being Berlin , Interior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has however given up his position however .
studying refugees could be easier to simplify access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a common status or de@@ for@@ estation won &apos;t receive any achievements according to the asylum application law , if they begin academic studies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will generally not get the BA@@ Fö@@ G since they fail to fall under the circle of the disabled persons .
tolerated refugees had to be lived in Germany so far , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible to be shortened by 1 January 2016 and shortened this span@@ iel to 15 months .
but also this financing must be closed , asking for Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Permanent Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should be given immediately to BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslim , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually enforce the equal rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ churches right into a new state @-@ religions .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare state that takes care of the new arri@@ vals .
rights are also obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the representative of Islam must agree on clear persons and agree to work with the state in many areas and to regulate some control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , eag@@ ern@@ ess also belongs to religious fundament@@ alism to this issue .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered in Germany .
those who want to pursue such conflicts in Germany have immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
in future integration will be much more than a topic for the whole society today .
thus , the majority society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and racism becomes more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has since a short decade an Anti@@ diskrimin@@ ierungs@@ stelle and a General Equ@@ al Code .
but it learns very slowly , how the NS@@ U @-@ pilot series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if were systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for everyone : what migrant organisations and stakeholders are calling for long and what international agreements , such as the anti @-@ racial ir@@ Convention Deutschland , must become reality in the coming years when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is unable to provide medical assistance to previously predicted refugees , the Federal Republic of Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ abilities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be flowing into the system .
to avoid the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all arri@@ vals immediately filed with the registration health cards .
provided achievements could be reck@@ oned by the Bundes@@ länder later .
and in the long term , it is highly questionable as many people will check with the limited performance of performance , which see the asylum application code .
otherwise , the doctors make especially the chance to create the language barriers .
already before , the Berlin schol@@ arly research scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are inf@@ lic@@ ted on their diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors , would have to be over@@ taken interpre@@ ting , she demands .
however , a lot of refugees would have been helped out in the emergency @-@ ambul@@ ances , but even with more general medical procedures .
and with a different diagnostic view .
in the refugee population , about two there are clearly more un@@ developed abilities , and with the young people go about HIV education .
most of the other disease patients , German physicians get from their education very clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite @-@ diar@@ rho@@ ea or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the anger of the anger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees can possibly be allevi@@ ated in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
if you are allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and trigger again further tests .
at least half of the refugees fle@@ eing in Germany are estimates of the bundle ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically again : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable , refugee @-@ in@@ der , explained Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study of the TU Munich demonstrated that every five Syrian Arab Spring is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ like disorder suffers from among other things on so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with respiratory not , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart bre@@ ads and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms are dor@@ ms and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , strong co@@ ar@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms of chronic , a early treatment would be necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z .
up to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ic sick refugees receive an psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers can present an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
moreover , in the social offices , most often experts or doctors , who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this is often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites for dreams
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the Cir@@ cus People into the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group in the ban from fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and beauty entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus works in the man@@ ege for the goat &apos;s w@@ ells for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ pper@@ corn , and junior woman .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current management stage .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to delight is therefore in the blood .
&quot; to us it is important that people get away from their day @-@ to @-@ day talk and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old j@@ uni@@ ors .
&quot; man@@ e@@ gen@@ ov with world city flair , &quot; so the Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometers long tour can now be experienced .
the program of Cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family moves the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Castillo Brothers understand their hand@@ craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it is possible to accommodate the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
your hum@@ orous art on the mast is supposed to conquer in the storm .
except through numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus works also with finger@@ prints and joint @-@ union .
balance with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan not a problem .
snake : fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little other and intri@@ gues with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Stephan@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
abnorm@@ ality in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the topic of different animal protection organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst is also taking place , &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read according to every wish from their eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the ring .
the top@@ most commandment therefore : good for the animals to care .
specially for its zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is proud .
the two animals lived together in a c@@ ages for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , &quot; no matter whether there are five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are included with all our heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at home from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 8 pm .
Sunday morning the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 am the rates are reduced .

the expected job structure leads to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP is said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more sustainable , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who aims to direct unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ ders
Wen@@ ger warns against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and that his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario actually means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will probably be missed on the next four games for England and , given its history , its involvement in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere has strongly over the last season after a separate knot@@ ting violation and then returned to his old swing back during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his knees , or with the wounds that he had previously encountered .
this may be true in the medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there are the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of additional injuries , always when a player is trying to return to the midst of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had 23 different disorders of Wil@@ ders from his debut six years ago .
in just 65 of arsen@@ al , he played at the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs that have reported most of the victims .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a tense period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; L@@ Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ runs on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning to start Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also start with ger@@ tom@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players , who need it to give a small break @-@ up , &quot; L@@ Wen@@ ger said .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the greatest intimi@@ dation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated , following 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has started .
the stadium was shaken by a earthquake on Tuesday night , where the Richter scale had been tested on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League of capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continues to lead the club to his first European ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it has never worked with Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I have long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar designs in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open to , now even more desper@@ ate than ever before , such as su@@ icide rates below young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains more prevalent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Child Education Fair ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of putting the culture in question , the men prevented them for help if they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy spirits , &quot; their chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle from mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with their focus on style about substance , immedi@@ acy the response is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ fec@@ ycle and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists name ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money cannot really buy .
the Beautiful at Friends has been that this focuss@@ ing has been placed on the head .
each character was not defined by his labor , but by his personality , which gl@@ lowed through the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent gs , moments when f@@ lu@@ red in a comfortable arm@@ chair and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it anyway , even if they often go back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telep@@ hon@@ y psychological I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my response role for people who are de@@ pressed and su@@ ic@@ idal , has really clearly showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel not able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term sub@@ roll mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone the people look into moments of despair also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you want to visit com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest this weekend of the day totally re@@ designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see yourself sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say Hi .
you never know which difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria places to PS@@ G to help Malmö .
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani , after his hit against Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to teach in Malmö .
here are the game &apos;s report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani continued course to be the Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debit as PS@@ G players that brought the French master to the road but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their head , when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ box in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they are not only aiming for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a cl@@ atter of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic@@ s hidden chances in front of the gate . he was later started in play against his hometown team and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or off in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we did not have one or two other gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was able to hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place for Bordeaux in the First League , but he was awarded by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian @-@ proof was called the man , which can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran in last month by Manchester United , and he indicated that when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defence before he finished Johan Wil@@ and over nicely into the long corner of the network .
if however , someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory was dis@@ disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off , suggested to reach this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national play@@ mates on the field and was str@@ ing@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who goes far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they put little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave herself to , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ him@@ en , who was with no less than five attempts only in the first half , and then abandoned after being put on after the restart .
nevertheless he went a lot more skill than he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was turned into a snapshot by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was transformed from Wil@@ low to the pole in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate was finally short after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans therefore scored his sixth position after being called I@@ bra@@ him@@ en a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts on the fact that Malmö could get back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ ders from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz to stop , the final result could last low before spare parts Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later issued that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification round is not sufficient . &quot;
you off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champi@@ ons X@@ avi have been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obvious some years ago just before the commitment of Spain Cas@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times of Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ bo@@ ger , four times champion , twice annual champion , two times champion , one time world champion , the title @-@ list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the age of 35 @-@ year @-@ old moved to FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
however , in an interview with the Mar@@ ca Ver@@ an@@ t X@@ avi now believe that he was already standing before the de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ de @-@ old before the EM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid did everything that then won anything , we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says nothing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Ju@@ z@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi were not changed
but the transition did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man today works for the german record of the German record : PE@@ P - Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken an agreement on Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P said I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this made me craw@@ l . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays great variety in film production
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Afgh@@ an American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said they are not needed behind the scenes .
during a follow @-@ up of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown added , as this emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do you do it in filling the film and not by filling the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown responds to , with ins@@ ul@@ led un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . ok , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian itself .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the product line of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ Brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut@@ rac@@ ed , which is beaten by her white feed .
the producer of De@@ ar White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the Director &apos;s rights to the film : Dam@@ on ref@@ uted that her direc@@ ting could give us something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter : Mr Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - this is the KNO@@ WS that hur@@ ts it . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ ur@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at any time , at the exact racial representation in the media at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement of black lives nationwide and urged legis@@ lators and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colored shr@@ inks .
in February the singers Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees for the 2005 Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; record silent &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the movement Black lives have published a statement and presented as a response to the matter of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck as to whether the group should be considered as an en@@ vy group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media gu@@ ets , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the west .

Pro @-@ sports@@ clim@@ bers and user support Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home a big prize of 1 Million $ with home .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced any competition participant , who could complete all steps of his obstacle course .
during the season announced there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the finals .
the climbing walls belonged to a 75 foot long climbing @-@ rope in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the time that he had been the first athlete , which completed the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenge full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with e ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock over winning the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never had more than 10,000 $ or life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money .
so all of a sudden ... as I cannot imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed continued with The Hollywood repor@@ ters to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he finished the course at all , not just your prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the magnificent gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he is talking about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would feel just as if they had exchanged their roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a short@@ coming season , the shooting will start in early 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ anders in Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit tiger .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tigers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , but played this part in the Tuesday perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the sponsors donated a chance to climb within a half of Houston Ast@@ i for the second American League Wild@@ card square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive contribution , as Detroit became three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in 1 / 3 internal and made three R@@ uns .
it has only been his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ seye each game and so I really will concentrate in the game .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Martin@@ ez had three matches and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is from mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game of Martin@@ ez , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has put the spotlight on well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said goodbye . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at his ( German training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear of the seventh internal courtyard , T@@ wins won the best chance to get back into the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double at the left field .
Right Hand of Aaron H@@ icks got a bun@@ gled , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was faced , in front of the nomin@@ ee R@@ ookie - Miguel S@@ ano who will bolt from the right @-@ handed triangle .
with a pair of runners and the finishing @-@ run at the second , ha@@ ges the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the major championship for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ catch had a double play .
after Detroit added an Insurance to run at the end of the ninth acc@@ ent , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed bag , however , is out of three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of one still im@@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veteran , who had been painted before the game from the viol@@ ating list , having been missing for over a month because of a back pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and sen@@ sing that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ man in the first took a little down to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Martin@@ ez managed to run a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Martin@@ ez managed his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the run@@ e in the scoring position .

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria a option
the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for an option .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the wrong @-@ thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave a collective look to the European states .
four years ago , it was glad that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict stretches at our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
after Germany Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Foreign Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary I will now back no one back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too has returned no refugees to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the question of an agreement , after which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there was already discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers put them not and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your target is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new start @-@ up to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the states in the first supply and distribution of the people .
in collaboration with the countries , Merkel will be offering this in collaboration with the countries on the evening after almost four @-@ year consultations with the Prime Minister within the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , men , the protection , de@@ ple@@ dges these also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who do not have any position in the lead can also not remain in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this view was put into account in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with &quot; huge power exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck at the can@@ oe route .

Rama missing for several weeks in 18@@ 60 Munich

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is very difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
he wants to pay attention to his s@@ lim@@ mer line , to whom is often called out of them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular they contain man@@ goes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eats the fruit thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing it , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant .
the form@@ work @-@ color alone does not tell about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ goes can taste very delicious .
they should be consumed at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet food .
but a man@@ go gives also hearty dishes a special touch .
they mi@@ tig@@ ate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salt like Chic@@ or@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits nicely with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and wild .

on Wednesday and on the night the F@@ öhn is partly blowing with assault rif@@ le with the tor@@ pers .
after her@@ on on Thursday morning , a distinctive k@@ old @-@ front crosses us that gets active rainf@@ alls , wind @-@ goats and a temperature retreat .
like Mete@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently sitting on the front of an extensive vessel @-@ area over the British islands in a hef@@ ty south @-@ west coast .
on the tran@@ ts side the night breaks through the valleys through the valleys .
in the episode , the blow @-@ dryer up to Thursday morning by goats of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ d@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .

while in the north the hot@@ spot tou@@ ted in summer heat for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity is beginning to cut down at the al@@ ights .

in sum , the south of the Alps must be equivalent to some 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meter , depending on the fact that the rainf@@ all had already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer to the air , in the episode rolls a stor@@ y@@ front with heavy , some swe@@ ating rain from west to east via Switzerland .

Rome has a Martin Luther &apos;s place
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place .
in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday a hitherto unknown square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io valley was baptized in the name of the German reform@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing had been requested for by the Working Group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live for centuries as a minority often only in hiding their faith .
in a symbolic manner , the Place will become visible in a symbolic manner that the Tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) remained as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a sin@@ ner ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions are likely to blame him in the opinion of historians at his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated with his theses against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del , the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer artist moved three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , the Oth@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated text texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated its very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 reasons .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary : the respective subjects are adjusted , that may well have quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the resulting elements are cycles , which concern itself with issues such as crosses , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
in this way he is immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther n@@ publisher with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post which is based on painting and the scriptures .
he interpreted the Bible from Ot@@ mar &apos;s old Bible and so is today translated into present circles .
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible of Martin Luther and each of the artist &apos;s original biblical heritage , who here put their very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allowed twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a great deal of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately to be a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant reign Order .
&quot; since the education happened already with the barrel , &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop working so I might have to do with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
its second concern is to put art at more importance in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertisements today , and which is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ pressed .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the spect@@ ator wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ part &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , they appear and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image looks for its object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ bel launched on Tuesday for the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art , &quot; I like he understands his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to capture the Bible completely , it is also important for him to make significant and mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; written is a picture Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publisher , this work is an invitation to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak for se@@ ag@@ us both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - labels and can@@ v@@ ases - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model the door@@ bell for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - yet again before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
failures in politics and administration provided for failure , especially among the residents who do not accept the railway .
thus , hills scre@@ ened up , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permits .
the permit will come in October , the first version of the Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck was to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year again from visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; with the works at the former H@@ indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensified involvement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , in the course of the weekend to play a clear sign .
the football responds to the situation in Germany and ensures the policy of its help in dealing with the associated problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest every single person to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during an annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet there the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ma@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soccer can and wants to help .
but the decisive step has to be policy .
the German soccer league has therefore increased its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; crossing the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some of the federal institutions can support this programme .
already on this weekend the 36 Profil@@ ing are placing a clear sign if they are going on the left side of the Tri@@ kot@@ le@@ mel instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &apos; We will help with the # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ Sports boss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ders of the &quot; Photo &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every day , nobody must fores@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can help football ists , no , we need to use our radiation , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager , Michael Pre@@ etz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the manager Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent characters of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach stressed the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies have started their own projects in their respective locations is great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are still active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year the association , jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , represents 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; associations have also already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
reports : SAP res@@ ellers now loses an eye on the accident
the chief of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill M@@ Der@@ em@@ t , has lost its left eye with several reports , according to several reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after midnight , on the steps in the house of his brother in the USA he was fallen at midnight on a sea glass which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , then he has moved out onto the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ asso flat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can carry out his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functioning &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday night swe@@ eping ) , he will return to Germany in October and further win the software company .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was standing in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso lenses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ em@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said anything like that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important to stand up again if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from battle @-@ feathers ...

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us finally failed in the first group game of the European league .
the National player will be missing the football guides of the soccer league also in the du@@ el with the FK cr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ 7.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot draw on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ uss will be back in the Bundesliga with Le@@ verk@@ usen , on Sunday , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its professionals Tu@@ ch@@ el will change its anc@@ eleven not only on the re@@ us position .
as a result he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of regul@@ ator Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he was training on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher for the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europe @-@ league games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left the open level .
in high likelihood , he will also share the second part .
the for@@ et@@ ting statement by fellow @-@ players re@@ us that the Fin@@ als must be aiming for the BV@@ B in the European league will be the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; this fact Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to take the lead role in Germany
according to the will of the German federal government , Germany must be a pioneer in the change of cars in technology .
the Federal Cab@@ inet was decided on Wednesday a strategic policy from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the fair of R@@ esse IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and take care of less stagn@@ ation , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
in addition , he wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Department of Computer stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band and high @-@ level entry on digital radio .
there is currently a test circuit on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks will be explored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , to be adapted to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use roughly an international level to raise the maximum speed @-@ speed for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometres .
the German government also wants to apply to a change of the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human race as a driver .
in automated driving takes over the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , high @-@ automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , less cars on public roads will be expected to be expected only far by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added value in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimates the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws is able to lead to increased safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD traffic ch@@ ast@@ ering S@@ ar Bar@@ to@@ l .
however , the issue of liability in accidents and the security of personal data of the driver must be clear .
still the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars were skep@@ tical , however - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday presented on the AA Institute in behalf of the Test @-@ Institute DE@@ K@@ RA will come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will enforce in the next 10 years , 32 percent do not expect him at all in 20 years .
in France 21 percent of respondents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ travelling vehicle .
after a survey of the digital market Bit@@ kom would only be met seven percent , while travelling across the streets across the streets .
on the highway , the traffic in flowing can be at least 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
in every fourth , the car would not be left to control by car under any circumstance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the parliament , Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ mann during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was due to this time during the flight to a long @-@ term , sponsor@@ ing par@@ l@@ mine in China .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a l@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures in Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich to show an exhibition about his work .
the highlights : display man@@ nequ@@ ins , which look scary thanks to video@@ projection .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the great star of the fashion scene , among others - and with it that he put men in skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was quite easy , meanwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om side@@ walk on the running ver@@ ste@@ g ) , which is visible from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ pic@@ ks has changed his beginning to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been set up in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ as .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this barely an out@@ going work of the man , who has written fashion history , without ever being able to do a job .
chron@@ ologically , the display is not rebuilt , but it is an outstanding choreo@@ grapher overall work that has been operated for a lot of effort : to fres@@ ise the dolls , for example it &apos;s a sty@@ list .
14 tons of material have spar@@ ed the creators according to the curator , Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather tro@@ users out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Te@@ ddy is available in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d mod@@ i c@@ ous@@ ins of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poorly dressed in football ) he attracted his te@@ ddy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he subsequently taken the form of fashion even later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later , I bought it my first time .
for his first own che@@ ap@@ look he cannot pay the mod@@ elled .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
previously it went to the long embro@@ ider@@ ies in and around skir@@ ting to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , for example they re@@ worked on blankets and sheer curtains .
this alone is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ kka , Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important once more .
in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion played a larger role , was then pushed onto the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and on regional costumes .
anyway , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , that leans out to past Sti@@ emp@@ po@@ chen , is a acc@@ ent contractor .
whoever does not use niche in the field of textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
mo@@ th@@ onia Pl@@ auen together with nine other companies is a member of the En@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ y .
only they must bear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are broken .
private dealers and also the wholesale trade there is almost no more .
our products can hardly reach customers on this path .
the mass ware is manufactured nowadays in the Asian region a lot cheaper and almost exclusively distributed through chains .
in addition , weak@@ le the export , currently on Russia and in the US .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the we@@ arer association also tries to score by environmental awareness as Cord@@ ula Bauer explains from the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since that year we have a quality seal , that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diplom@@ designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snow @-@ office of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied arts - and is specialised on embro@@ ider@@ ies and spi@@ kes .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that need to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a couple of years ago , wil@@ der design@@ ate Kat@@ i Re@@ uter takes advantage of the historic snail @-@ top .
the machine embro@@ i@@ dered in some places small bowl .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ dy was inspired : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ board pe@@ ar for her jewellery .
in an elaborate processes they have the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; said Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the United States , Australia and Finland - most of all to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ zen and surroundings and would like to have a piece of memory .
I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador to the pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends should not be moved , but Disney still dar@@ ing to get a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
they are talking about &quot; entertainment Weekly , &quot; but not a new continuation , but a sort of continuation that is playing 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks in times of the financial crisis in England .
who &apos;s P@@ opp@@ ins has more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director already stands for : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; at the cinema .
XI insisted that the economy is wider for the world
the economy must open wide out@@ wards to the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was put in charge of forming the reform .
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address in the 16th session of the Central Economic Group for a deepening of a comprehensive reform .
encouraging new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the executive group has adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list to settle the access process , relaxation of the border controls , financial support , funding of the enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the population of Mel@@ des@@ h .
after the statement , a negative list has been created , which identifies the sectors and companies that are not in question for investments .
the system is being tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of significance , as it indicates the market a major role in allocation of resources to create a right @-@ state business environment and open the market , &quot; said statement .
the government will also ease inspections of the powers transferred to the company and make sure businesses decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China allowed borders to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer , public controlled sector , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &apos; Green Card &apos; by getting the requirements optimized and the application process is facilitated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use expert judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li A@@ qi@@ ang and major leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , were included in the statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury value in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and consumers to make it a much higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which is a relative of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans &quot; sharp : &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full power of pregnant and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt projected to increase the threshold values of the nerve poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury , according to fish .
large rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are so heavily ra@@ ined with mer@@ cury , that approximately 50 per cent of the length is not allowed to be sold .
after the dou@@ bling of the threshold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ ven@@ al .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to reduce the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram .
food watch , however , referred to as &quot; trick &quot; because minor damage , such as car@@ p are usually as low as they already keep the planned maximum levels already today .
the ab@@ ang@@ lement from Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de inter@@ maneu@@ ver , which only helps the economy &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a poison@@ ous component for man that has grown strongly on the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low levels can cause especially severe damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on its website with regard to the current limits , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; had to be expected .
Mercury is mainly due to coal combustion in the environment .
the German coal power plants come across according to a written request from the Federal Ministry of Commerce to the Green Party of the Parliament , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bi , more than six tons of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish almost in Elbe , Rhine and Danube be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited out of paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe received widespread warnings for mer@@ cury in fish already among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system R@@ AS@@ FF .
