a re@@ agent for blood group@@ ing must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is the anti@@ body or other on the label stated substance .
a Re@@ agen@@ z is recommended in the way recommended by the manufacturer thus the following factors or appearances occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by always new di@@ lution of the indi@@ cted re@@ agen@@ das to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ ge@@ aring in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of volume of blood @-@ in@@ und@@ ation in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object @-@ related , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object carrier .
the World Health Organization has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to av@@ ail and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity at the time standards .
according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles , which are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of the re@@ agents to the blood group@@ ing of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary that is observed in a series of di@@ lution with an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ation in@@ und@@ ation .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a microsc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination is occurring .
the efficacy of the re@@ agents to the blood group@@ ing for the International standard properties are present ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ full Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ le of non @-@ known re@@ agen@@ at in International units ( See Bulletin of WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

a Re@@ agen@@ z is held by the recommended conditions proposed by the manufacturer , so the necessary qualities are to be preserved for at least one year long .
the expiry date of a re@@ agent in the special form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory result .
that on the label to use exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the shelf @-@ life attempts ; it is com@@ promised by the state super@@ vis@@ ors .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of intact gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , where it is dried up and that is so locked that no moisture can penetrate .
a dr@@ y@@ re@@ agent must lose at most 0,5 v.@@ H. of his weight , if it &apos;s due to further drying via phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ ine under a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent government authority may determine that the Re@@ agen@@ z ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents delivered ) provided an anti@@ sep@@ tics and / or antibiotic , provided the Re@@ agen@@ z with the added substance continue to feed the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .

the re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in exc@@ es@@ irable form or after re@@ sol@@ ation , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the conditions for international exchanges of re@@ agents to the blood group@@ ing should not be artificial as possible , at least as long as not until an international agreement has come about an integral system .
re@@ agents of re@@ agents are to distribute re@@ agents in such a manner and in such quantities that the Re@@ agen@@ z is located not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the amount necessary in a container must be so large that the content may possibly be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the producer &apos;s laboratory has to lead through all the production stages and checks of re@@ agents to the blood group@@ ed notes in written records .
appropriate samples of all issued re@@ agents are to be kept as long from the laboratory of laboratory , until with some probability that the char@@ ge will no longer be used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ determination of chemicals can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to enhance the effectiveness and the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
that does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black on white label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , on dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ charging
furthermore , this label or label on the box , in which the individual containers are , or which include the containers attached utility guide the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

protocol to the Convention of 1979 by far @-@ spatial air pollution regarding the fight against emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ up@@ id river
concerned about the current emissions of aviation substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America will cause damage to natural resources of vital importance for the environment and the economy ,
bearing in mind that the Executive Board recognised the need for the Convention on its second meeting the need to reduce the annual emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from or@@ ts@@ fixed and movable springs or their gr@@ ace@@ ous flow across 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already progres@@ sed in reducing these emissions , maintain and review their emissions limit for nitrogen oxi@@ des ,
taking account of existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and effects of nitrogen oxi@@ des and subsequent products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to seize effective interventions to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ ace@@ ous river , particularly by applying suitable national emissions limit for new mobile @-@ core sources , as well as retro@@ fitting of existing greater source sources ,
recognizing that scientific and technical knowledge will develop on these issues and that this development can be considered during the verification of the application of this protocol and the decision on further measures ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in knowledge that the development of an effective scientific basis is based on creating a effective scientific basis , which is to take into consideration when checking the application of this protocol and the decision on further internationally negotiated measures , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in knowledge that the e@@ ous audit of procedures for the creation of more favorable conditions for technology exchange will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the European Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with satisfaction , knowing that several countries have committed themselves to one another , to dis@@ agree on their annual national emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des , and to substantial extent to considerable extent ,
