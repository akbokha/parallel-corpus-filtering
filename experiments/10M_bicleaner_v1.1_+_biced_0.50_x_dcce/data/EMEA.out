Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of female episodes in patients who addressed the drug in the past .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied for fast control of gest@@ ational un@@ rest or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
with both diseases , the solution can be applied to the inser@@ tion or the melt tables in patients where the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who take simultaneously other medicines , who are just like Abi@@ li@@ fy should be the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ zo@@ le probably acts mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onists &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent acts as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
because dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and to avoid re @-@ occur .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the re@@ occurrence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over to one year examined .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study , Abi@@ li@@ fy over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo that have been re@@ inst@@ ated to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , associated with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( a different anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the alteration of symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also led studies carried out studies in order to investigate how the body has the mel@@ ting tab@@ let@@ ins and the solution to take res@@ or@@ ated ( asc@@ takes ) .
in the two studies shown with the inj@@ ecting solution patients , the Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms stolen more anxiety than the patients who got a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term symptoms of more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re @-@ emergence Man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients and if there is additionally an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms stolen and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ater@@ yr@@ alis ) , head@@ ache ( beats ) , bl@@ aming ( sle@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( sle@@ p@@ ation ) , s@@ ali@@ va ( elevated water production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from medium to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes had on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le , towards the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ecting un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders occur in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ ble @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ ble @-@ workers and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le languages ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a cost dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dosage for A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ al @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ osis should be considered , if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is dis@@ assembled from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treating with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there is no increased su@@ pre@@ macy with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines .
Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le should be treated with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ in@@ far@@ es or isch@@ a@@ ascular diseases , conditions , which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ resistant medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including sac@@ redness and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

if with an A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y treat patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sp@@ in@@ age , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate to a m@@ ns or im@@ clear flu@@ ber without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines , including A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y must be set .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ut@@ ations in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are applied with be@@ aters .

however , there were in one of these studies , a study with Fi@@ x@@ er Dos@@ age , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ ac@@ acia or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related events associated with A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents to allow direct compar@@ isons .

a weight gain is generally prescribed by schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines , in which weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le is taken in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines with having con@@ fine side effects such as se@@ co@@ ding ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ ony Fam@@ o@@ ti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ p@@ ation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le , but this effect is not relevant to a clin@@ ically .

it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .

if you take into consideration the common gift of ket@@ ac@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV inhibit@@ ors , could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
after completing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors the dosage should be lifted from A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y to the dosage height before the start of the esc@@ ort therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with A@@ BI@@ LIF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ ke concentr@@ ations .

patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le .
due to the insufficient data base to safety during the human being and due to the concerns associated with the animal welfare studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits jus@@ ti@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics patients should be warned before , dangerous machines , including vehicles , to use until they are safe that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le has no negative influence on it .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 52 weeks , in patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le , an overall lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ chy , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .

in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional transi@@ tions with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le alone in adult patients with valued cans of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths observed .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ yl@@ benzene ; however , it is unlikely that Bun@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le has a high plastic band@@ aging .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ le in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ al @-@ I disorder is the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on ser@@ otonin D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le showed a high monkey in vit@@ ro for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ ors and a moderate in@@ arity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and for hi@@ st@@ amin @-@ H@@ 1 recept@@ ors .

in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aspir@@ ation , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the whole population , but a statistical Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z could be determined due to decreased patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ zo@@ le ( oral ) compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psycho@@ tic symptoms .

the efficacy of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , attended to 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had received a anth@@ racycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all kinds of gen@@ res or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el sof@@ tening medication ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients received conventional medicine .
considering only the patient who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in relation to the deterioration of disease and survival there was no difference between drugs .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that abra@@ x@@ ane is effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
in addition , it must not be used in patients who have breast@@ feeding or prior to the treatment of low neutrality in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that abra@@ x@@ ane in patients whose first treatment is no longer aimed , effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ob@@ liter@@ al medicines could not be given with other medicines to reduce unwanted effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission appointed Er@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited without a permit for the influ@@ encing of abra@@ sion in the entire European Union .
my@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ oma in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is mis@@ diagnosed and is not shown for the standard anth@@ racycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie ( neutrality &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy during the abra@@ sion therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in case of sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy degrees 3 the treatment is going to interrup@@ t until a bet@@ tering up to degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies performed with patients with com@@ promised kidney function and there are currently no adequate data for recommendation from dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
my@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient personal data relating to un@@ availability and effectiveness .
my@@ x@@ ane is a night@@ club used by P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could be significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulations of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be taken immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment is taken , and the patient must not be treated once again with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patient , no new abra@@ sion treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ron of the neut@@ ron has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the pi@@ ous number again rose to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly marked with abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with Lyme cardi@@ ac toxicity , kar@@ di@@ al inci@@ dents in the indigenous patients are not uncommon , especially in patients with early anth@@ racycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease .
if in case of patients after the gift of abra@@ sion nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sp@@ ing means .
abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not apply effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of mother with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable locking method .
male patients who are treated with my@@ x@@ ane is advised to bear no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should let yourself be advised before the treatment via a sperm process , since the therapy with my@@ x@@ an is the possibility of irrever@@ sible in@@ fertility .
my@@ x@@ an may cause side @-@ effects as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the modes of traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
in the following are the most common and most important occur@@ ren@@ ces of side @-@ effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 my@@ x@@ ane .
neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quick rever@@ sible and dos@@ ed ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed at 46 % of patients with my@@ x@@ ane treated patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dosage and indication in studies are performed ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ cr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the de@@ composition of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ul@@ Indi@@ ra and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ ation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ e@@ tic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ is convey@@ s Trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis from Plas@@ ma@@ el@@ osis in the endo@@ th@@ el@@ cells and in the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies , it has been proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ ber promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sig@@ nat@@ al transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ recept@@ or is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( U@@ ted Jo@@ aci@@ dic Rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) is an P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ om is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ bed un@@ verbal studies and by 4@@ 54 patients , who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III @-@ reference study .
in a study 43 patients treated with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma treated with my@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion than 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi @-@ centric study was conducted in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ oma that received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ uble reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the survey , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % due to Met@@ ast@@ asi@@ fication and adjuv@@ ant treatment .

10 After intraven@@ ous gift from my@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation took place in a multi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or cor@@ relation of p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were according to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute sub@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 my@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ itary p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el compared .
the clearing of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after my@@ x@@ ane @-@ G@@ abe higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ uble p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was at my@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies of human@@ ic micro@@ some and tissue assessment , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .

this means de@@ pl@@ amed of a biological drug is similar to which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; Reference Medi@@ cin@@ al &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which might occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if before the intervention a self @-@ blood@@ shed is not possible , and in which a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make up a self @-@ blood @-@ end , is se@@ amed to in@@ ject in a v@@ ein .
inj@@ ections may also be made by the patient or his super@@ vis@@ ors , provided that they have received adequate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or with patients who receive an chemotherapy , the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bu@@ n values should always occur in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per de@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ inal cav@@ ity or thereby , that the body does not sufficiently respond to the physical er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were either se@@ amed on se@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ ost@@ rot@@ ate values between the beginning of the study and the period period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of suffering from the skin spec@@ ted with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received an chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who caused caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the Hä@@ nel &apos;s values were raised on Ab@@ se@@ ams , in the same measure as with those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients , which continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the starting value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of se@@ ams is a rise in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephalopath@@ y ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ ep@@ tic head@@ aches and per@@ plex@@ ity .
se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ected under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for se@@ ams in accordance with the provisions of the European Union is proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an ail@@ ment which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and men .
it is used in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including in patients who suffered recently a little traum@@ atic hip , such as in fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease , which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get must take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting in a muscle .
administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ op@@ ul@@ ls or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ inn@@ ate symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is like in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the review by A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was examined by the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study summ@@ ed up 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined for the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
major indicator of the pot@@ ency was whether the sal@@ ary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us in the Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me which sank in the blood again normal or by at least 75 % compared to the starting point dropped .
the study involving elderly women was reduced the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) for a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo over 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving males and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent on repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic or other Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates patients , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney cancer , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for physicians to apply the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as applying the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side @-@ side effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

this results in fact that light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive ren@@ al factor to down to a kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Cust@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .

decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone construction is made fast , and new bone material becomes un@@ sorted , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by adding a normal bone formation again which gives a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength once more .
if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery , notify your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
when applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharm@@ aci@@ sts or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply respectively recently taken / apply , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you take medicine from which it is known to damage the kidneys .
when applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a along with food and drink , you are worried that you should take sufficient fluid in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ ur@@ inary Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies in order to take recommendations on drug use .
acet@@ one is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abolic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) to be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with an sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ ular or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ n@@ uns or ins@@ ulin can be kept at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos therapy , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl alcohol or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body @-@ own ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level reduced , which makes a type 2 @-@ 2 diabetes better .
more than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with an sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ ular , in addition they got up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value , which can be for@@ ged that the blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered by employing 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ benzene in a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values are 0.@@ 94 % whereas the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin is examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients requiring Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin is increased by 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who participated in addition to placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to friction ) .
acet@@ one may not be used in patients who may also be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver issues , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ mirror - acid level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos can be used as an alternative to standard treatment ( for use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission informed the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited without a permit for the marketing of an account in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , curved , and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combining ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate because of contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance . ( see section 4.4 ) .
for application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. , her@@ edi@@ tary coron@@ ary heart disease or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ms , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ms , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ kul@@ ak disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output Leb@@ er@@ enz@@ ym@@ eric ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard division ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to the 3 times the upper limit of the normal range is increased , the liver issues are to be monitored again as soon as possible .
if a patient Sympt@@ oms hints to point out to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained mal@@ eness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver values to verify .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be directed until the duration of the laboratory parameters of the clinical trial .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight gain is proven that can be con@@ gest@@ ures of fat and in some cases associated with hydr@@ ation .
as a result of a her@@ modi@@ fying effect , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a reduced decrease in the middle hem@@ ost@@ rot@@ ate ( relative reduced by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ r@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.3 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in to 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ ular and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in to 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , in patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale branch or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin is obtained , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there are direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , though patients should report about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic diagnosis should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with the women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.6 % ; 1,@@ 0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants to be pregnant or that occurs , the treatment will be canc@@ eled ( see section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions showed that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmac@@ opo@@ lies of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ed@@ mer are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ u@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) result in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreases in pregnant hyper@@ ins@@ ulin emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of mat@@ ernity and thus reducing the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; sel@@ dom &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data is not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ mo@@ ors and the re@@ fraction index of lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on entered AL@@ T @-@ an@@ gling over the thre@@ e@@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range just like under placebo but more often than in compar@@ isons in met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ mac@@ ular .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 percent higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the launch has rarely been reported about in@@ con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
it was conducted a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events with regards to bon@@ ding , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ isons .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.6 % ) of the patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to operate via an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ mel@@ ator Ac@@ count@@ ants Ac@@ ci@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin of liver , obesity , and sk@@ el@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ cos@@ ity production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ ity in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to investigate the time up to the after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ arding study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three @-@ on@@ ati@@ cal optim@@ izing phase with ins@@ ulin or random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced itself by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continue to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin metering in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated .
in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has shown an statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the album / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ o@@ ti@@ zed compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , study on type 2 @-@ diabe@@ tics in 18 weeks .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under Met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial made of gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both on a effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a kar@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease in groups , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either j@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is quickly res@@ or@@ ated , whereby the peak concentr@@ ations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma is usually 2 hours to application .
on this basis the contribution of M @-@ IV belongs to effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in Inter@@ action studies , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on could not have a relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmac@@ opo@@ lies of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises .

after oral application of radio@@ active Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the marker was found mainly in the fet@@ al ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination range of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 to 23 hours .
the plastic concentr@@ ations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abolic disease are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy prob@@ ands , with the r@@ arities of the oral clearing of the uter@@ ine distances .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration @-@ volume enlar@@ ging with here@@ tics , an@@ a@@ emia and irrever@@ sible coron@@ ary heart hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decreases in the shape of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the uter@@ ine and thereby reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for red@@ dish growth .

if the ur@@ inary period consists of two to four weeks still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still plaster cases ; therefore it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines to prevention of gyp@@ sy .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had transplan@@ tation because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the efficacy of various Aden@@ o@@ gic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) compared to a placebo ( hypo@@ cris@@ p ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level in the blood in the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l lay .
in the first study we had 48 % ( 126 of 2@@ 62 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 2@@ 69 ) of patients taking once daily 120 mg in the blood of below 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 2@@ 68 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no case of 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and ab@@ normal liver values .
in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease in the pre@@ history , there is possibly also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and the blood vessels .
the treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present toxic substances and / or a toxicity ) .
if the ser@@ um bags for 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage increase at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily may be considered .
in patients with severe kidney function , effectiveness and safety have not yet been completely investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people there are no experiences with children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

cardiovascular diseases For patients with sensitive heart disease or de@@ pre@@ pen@@ al heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ sow@@ ing medicines , it may come during the treatment start to an acute po@@ cht@@ on@@ ment , because by lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sow@@ o pi@@ eg@@ els initially ur@@ inary le@@ ys in the tissue can be mobili@@ zed .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , read@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is to rise to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver pre @-@ diseases during the phase 3 clinical studies of phase 3 have been recently observed with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore advised to perform at the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the clin@@ ically report a liver utility ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ b were not conducted in@@ effective studies at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the th@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an in@@ hibition of the met@@ abolic disease of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .
at Pro@@ ban@@ den , the simultaneous gen@@ res was associated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at@@ ology ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to lowering the ser@@ um bags under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ TI@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily along with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed at least 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ TI@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ TI@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily versus the treatment with the traditional use of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of the ser@@ um bags on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit during week 2 and permanently kept throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um car@@ in@@ contin@@ ous &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .

with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary function point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regards to percentage of ser@@ um acid concentration at Pro@@ ban@@ den , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary End@@ point in the group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ ON and F@@ act study ) had taken a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in the open survey study of phase 3 showed that the lasting reduction of ser@@ um bags on &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease in the incidence of plaster waste ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a gi@@ g@@ love ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the gyp@@ sum size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the ti@@ lt mark until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were obtained with patients who received a long term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients , the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ time extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and pri@@ ori@@ zation and is not relevant to clinical use as a result .
it was established that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ tal cans of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertili@@ zation and reproduction of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk for low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ tion of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the meal , the patient must lie down to the first food intake of the day , which should take at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines that are authorised in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was treated with patients suffering with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those used exclusively in Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose accurately the dose which is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of digestive disorders , dy@@ sp@@ le@@ es ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ ron@@ es ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) , dy@@ es ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( par@@ ched abdom@@ en ) as well as su@@ res rep@@ el .
in patients with metastatic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used in disorders of meals , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who are unable to stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or import of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following notes are exactly to follow to reduce the risk of offensive maturity and associated effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed up after the opening of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not break down the tablet at least 30 minutes before taking the tablet at the earliest .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ eding or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only with a special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .

the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms , pain , pain , or retro@@ fitting , pain , or new or sub@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ brennen threat@@ ens and comp@@ ose medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe solution @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased by patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it according to the appearance of symptoms that refer to a solution to irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all faculty instructions can be given to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large landscap@@ ed clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was established , rarely ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious problems and complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

the clinical assessment by the treating doctor is decisive for the therapy planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instru@@ cted that they should take the tablet at the time of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed its failure .
you are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other diseases , which imp@@ air the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D @-@ deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated at the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE too .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acid supplements and some oral drugs may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ tional studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical studies with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore cannot be used during pregnancy or nursing women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development . &quot; &quot; &quot;

fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ arding studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken by either 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new whir@@ l@@ frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7,@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption based on a intraven@@ ous reference structure , the average or@@ ale bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at amoun@@ ted to women 0,@@ 64 % for cans between 5 and 70 mg after closer fast@@ ings and two hours before recording a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
oste@@ opor@@ os@@ est@@ udi@@ an was al@@ end@@ ron@@ at effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy proportions , the Gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) is not clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is divided according to intraven@@ ous gen@@ res from 1 mg / kg temporarily in turn@@ around ri@@ bs , but then rapidly distributed in bone or re@@ tired with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were re@@ tired about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance within 72 hours with urine . little or no radio@@ activity was found in the barrels .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ al clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing is not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at will not take part in rats over the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is assumed not by humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through this transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the gift of radio@@ active vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy prob@@ es was the average discharge of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours 2,@@ 4 % , in barrels after 4 days of 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate that is not depos@@ ited in bone , quickly through urine .
although no clinical data is available about it , nevertheless , it is expected to be the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in the animal @-@ attempt to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

Adv@@ oc@@ raf is administered adult patients where a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts was to prevent a rep@@ ulsion of the transplan@@ ts through the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously studies involving Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney cancer , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
major indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was cr@@ ashed after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , for example , studied , how often a renewed transplan@@ tation or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies participated in 119 patients with no transplan@@ tation and 129 patients carried out with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ oc@@ raf is absorbed in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can result in transplan@@ ting or increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ aci@@ tiv@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always be the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the narrow control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in a consequence of an conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and corresponding dosage adjustment has to be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ oc@@ raf should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and in@@ compatibility in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a lower level , with both formulations both at Ni@@ er@@ â as well as le@@ ber@@ ated patients comparable .
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us upper level are advised during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance @-@ exposure in immediate after@@ math phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ oc@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ are@@ as can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient allowed in the first post@@ operative phase no oral intake of medicines may be initiated by the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml Con@@ centr@@ ate to the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application to the suppression of tran@@ sh@@ ing , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; more consistent , therefore , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - low prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis prevention , should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment may be later required , as the Pharmac@@ ology of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yl@@ actic proph@@ yl@@ actic therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf &apos;s must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose .

dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood cells in the desired area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function has no effect on the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ ph@@ os@@ oto@@ x@@ ical potenti@@ ary of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um dioxide levels ) is recommended , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ sist@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ raf When converting from one Cic@@ los@@ por@@ e to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ mirror in full blood The dose should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ulsion and toler@@ ability in the individual case , under the per@@ l @-@ removal of full @-@ bloo@@ di@@ ous Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level , during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic checks during the treatment .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be supervised by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances , which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments to the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the lower levels in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the slow@@ s of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually occurs in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in ren@@ al transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentr@@ ations were generally used in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has resulted in severe und@@ es@@ irable events , including tran@@ sh@@ ings , or other side @-@ effects that may occur in succession of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ sight .
patients should always be the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the regime should be conducted only under the narrow control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 On the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tion , which resulted in other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants as therapy would be no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation by adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts received in the child @-@ age there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf .
due to possible interactions formed to a sub@@ stitution of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ bic level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines used during treatment with advanced payment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ bic concentr@@ ations offered in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to significant variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was to be observed as cardi@@ ac opath@@ y , or in sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore can also be found at Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ici@@ an disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid exposure and o@@ iling .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the impact of sunlight or ul@@ tra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of skin lesi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or using a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
when patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for pr@@ es such as head@@ aches , altered levels of consciousness , cl@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the ble@@ eding of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advisable to change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in con@@ current amount of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining ev@@ enly concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly marked interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ release agents ( z ) .
Pharmac@@ ology studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased economic bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ do@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute exhau@@ st actions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or reduce the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed whose metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us upset the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thus increase hormone replacement , is particularly cau@@ tious with decisions about recep@@ tive actions .

Adv@@ oc@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood @-@ interference ) .
the dosage and frequency of application shall determine if Adv@@ enti@@ ate applied for the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of ble@@ eding at surgical intervention .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack , causing blood problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plasma , but produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate is another approved in the European Union named re@@ inde@@ ate , similarly , is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and surgical interventions .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ oc@@ ate has been rated at the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tum with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ oc@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Sch@@ win@@ ch , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ or protein , or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG appro@@ ving a permit for the influ@@ encing of investment in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are determined by the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII , according to the location and extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .
with the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ema events , the factor VIII factor is not to sink under the specified plastic bars ( in % of the standard or in ( / d@@ l ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are imp@@ aired .
inj@@ ecting any 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repe@@ ating the risk to the patient .
during the treatment process , the control of the inj@@ ecting dose and frequency of inj@@ ections is an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plastic bars .
individual patients can distinguish themselves in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis use long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis use in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 , by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII to do not reach VIII , or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to im@@ pe@@ ze if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weigh@@ ed .
the administration @-@ speed is to be measured after completion of the patient , whereby maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alization antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions are on the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exc@@ es@@ tion and am@@ nest@@ y inhibit@@ ors of inhibit@@ ors became known , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low inhibit@@ ors ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of the H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A in women lie above the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and l@@ ac@@ tation no experience .
those with the greatest number of patients creating A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) that all occurred in previously un@@ treated patients who have a higher risk to education of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .

based on the available data , the CH@@ MP has evaluated the benefits risk @-@ risk to be assessed as positive , but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of PS@@ Y@@ s every 6 months , decided that the admission fee should apply in 5 years to advance .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited registered with the Committee for Hum@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company takes its application for approval for the marketing of an Adv@@ ex@@ in for treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the cros@@ sover ( tissues which connects other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) of it .
this is a type of virus that was gene@@ tically modified so that a gene can contribute to the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in the Adv@@ oc@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has changed so that there cannot produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infection in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have s@@ inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus to make the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from which not broken in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells if DNA does not want to be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the canc@@ er@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study with a patient before , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub @-@ tree , in bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had tested the answers of the company on the questions posed there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the initial publication of the initial documents the CH@@ MP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ors brings benefits to the patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug by means of the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not adequately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the Company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently has to participate in clinical studies or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changing &quot; metabolism &quot; means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective constitu@@ ents will be released instantly and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len of the nas@@ al infection ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a skin ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and young people aged 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed upon the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the grav@@ ure of the h@@ ay @-@ n@@ ymp@@ tom@@ y that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary , and evaluated with a standard scale , how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all h@@ ay der@@ n@@ ymp@@ tom@@ y except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze recei@@ pts , about a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was regarded , the patients showed under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze an alle@@ vi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who inf@@ use des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( appeal ) , sei@@ z@@ ure , head@@ aches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( beats ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine to treat allergies ) are not being used .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart , or v@@ ascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ic stroke ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid ) or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ema stroke ( hyper@@ tension ) or already have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ema stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the influ@@ encing of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without dis@@ closing , break or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be used due to the failure of data to un@@ treat@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not being used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of application to 10 days since long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with the time .
after slow@@ ing the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breathing exercises , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ inde@@ xed in patients suffering with a mon@@ o@@ am@@ in@@ tox@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other Vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctors , per@@ go@@ id , cab@@ bage , diar@@ rho@@ ea , diar@@ rho@@ ea , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ ca@@ olin ( etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collective and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed about the treatment at the occurrence of a hyper@@ tension or a ton@@ ic , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any event@@ ual other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ ache ) must be de@@ posed .
in the treatment of following patients is advised to be taken care of : • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in@@ far@@ med in the An@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bronze pas@@ ser@@ ene in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines will otherwise hin@@ der positive reactions to indicators for housing campaigns or reduce it to their extent .
as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have also been administered in addition , however , were not clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies or changes in the plastic concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests could not be identified any significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those with placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol has been taken .
the enzy@@ me responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded .
DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the im@@ plant@@ ing of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ct@@ oral properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should be el@@ u@@ ci@@ dated that in very rare cases , it may come to a stu@@ per that may lead to an impair@@ ment of the sight@@ edness , or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ dierung , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , coron@@ ary heart collap@@ ses ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with potential let@@ ter@@ ations .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ in@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin creams , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ spec@@ ting cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Master cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the no@@ etic molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
in a single @-@ dose study with adults des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg does not affect standard output ranges , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective beats or the tasks associated with the fly .
in controlled clinical trials included at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased incidence of beats compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a tick @-@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Tablets received .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines based on the overall base cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nas@@ al infections ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decrease effect , determined by the nose grinding skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in view of sex , age or ethnic group .
as part of a single dose of Pharmac@@ ology from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is proven in 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow rate of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine is reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ed study , which was carried out with the formulation as tablets in healthy adult subjects , has been noted that four subjects dis@@ inter@@ ns des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly changed .
a component Inter@@ action study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , after the all@@ r@@ abe of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ accumulative was for exposure to gift of a aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity for repeti@@ tive tolerance , to treat gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and Re@@ productive toxicity , the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however no special risks to humans .
the combination poss@@ essed no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in the combination of c@@ at@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was in the or@@ al gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

there is limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people from 12 to 17 years old ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed in accordance with the recent disease progression and may end up after the end of the symptoms and be re @-@ recorded at their re @-@ occur .
in the Persian &apos;s allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies were not found in the framework of clinical studies involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have also been administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the incidence of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not been reinforced by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should be el@@ u@@ ci@@ dated about it in very rare cases to r@@ ams that may lead to an impair@@ ment of the sight@@ edness , or the ability to operate machinery .
clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently used side @-@ effects reported on the more common than in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ iness ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
during a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side of side head@@ aches that occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary research study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ninth clinical dose ) were not observed , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ spec@@ ting cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human Master cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the no@@ etic molec@@ ule P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multi @-@ professional doses , in a dosage range of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistical significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ dio effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is administered for in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ o@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days was not shown by an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in a single @-@ dos@@ ed study involving adults , DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard output ranges , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks associated with the fly .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of the nose , it@@ ching , l@@ aces , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and Per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into dependence upon the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ acting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist rh@@ initi@@ s .
associated allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Persian &apos;s allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the entire process of cargo to the quality of life at Rhino con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the due to seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic urine was dep@@ rec@@ tive for further forms of anti @-@ specimen , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of e@@ ti@@ ology in the various forms is similar and chronic patients can be simpler to be pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the H@@ ist@@ am@@ in@@ un@@ is@@ ment is a s@@ ut@@ ational factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , is expected to result in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine besides the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria also in other forms of anti @-@ fung@@ al infections ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of quantity and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dosage .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines at chronic idi@@ opathic urine , the minority of patients , who are not re@@ acted on anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines , from the study was excluded .
an improvement of the it@@ ch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients with placebo @-@ treated patients .
the treatment with a@@ eri@@ us reduced the dis@@ ruption of sleep and vig@@ or as significant as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmaceutical research study , in which the patient @-@ demo@@ graphics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was achieved with 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzy@@ me responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely excluded .
DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single @-@ dos@@ ed study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg the meals ( fatty acid , cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not depend on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical studies performed using des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , at a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity for repeated testing , gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity and the Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity the pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no special risks to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ acting and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with a@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , during the diagnosis the am@@ n@@ esis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory studies and skin @-@ examination have a role to play .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 years , the restricted met@@ abo@@ o , is identical to that of children who use normal met@@ abo@@ o .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ dependen@@ cies were not found in the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in addition have been administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involved in the intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is no ampli@@ fied effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group like in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic urine , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary research study in adults and adolescents , were administered with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ninth clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( at the age between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al in adults to the children population .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multi@@ lateral users of adults and adolescents , used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant car@@ dio effect was described .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) officially admitted that the company returns his application for approval for the in@@ verse of A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people for protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that might cause a strain of the grip @-@ virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus spreads , which can easily spread from man to man , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine administered as &quot; physical @-@ virus &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later able to form with a contact with a grip @-@ virus this gene@@ tically faster antibodies .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as physical @-@ alien ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the studies shows that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this makes the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA for pre@@ pan@@ mic vaccines .
if you are participating in a clinical trial and need further information regarding your treatment , please contact your medical doctor .
if you require further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human@@ izing immune virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired Immun@@ e Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for immer@@ sion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination was not studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be en@@ acted only when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral medicines has previously taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that the virus is addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between the ages of four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is determined according to the body weight .
aspir@@ ation decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , may delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and disorders .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which were previously not treated with prot@@ ections .
the enhanced cr@@ ush@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ ections , with other prot@@ ections .
major indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the transformation of Vir@@ us last after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ections , although after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ a more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last among 400 copies / ml than under placebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children having reduced A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us last , however , were treated by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ections , very few to the treatment spoke .
in the study involving adults , who had been treated earlier with demonstr@@ ators had been treated earlier with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ let last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ eas@@ ants :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ esters , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us last after four weeks than with the patients who continued their previous demonstr@@ ators :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin rash and FA@@ TI@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ag@@ ul@@ ls or one of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as inten@@ tional and are detri@@ mental in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are taking the risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) or an immune activation ( symptom of bone tissue ) or an immune activation ( Sympt@@ oms of an infection which caused by a reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in use with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not previously taken any prot@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has originally been approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group company Limited as a permit for the influ@@ encing of aspir@@ ation in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ections ( PI ) prescribed adults and children aged 4 years .
for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts of Am@@ mu@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r should take into account the individual viral resistance and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than by Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base does not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ Generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ corrup@@ r twice daily with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ Generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily basis of 2400 mg Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Pharmac@@ ology , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ esters have not been studied with children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years old , due to the failure of data relating to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to adult patients with medium @-@ heavy liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or even Leb@@ er@@ function with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs that have low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ corrup@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral compres@@ sor therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver interactions with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of simultaneous treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please refer to the relevant specialized information on this medicine .
patients with existing restriction liver including a chronic @-@ active hep@@ atitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral compres@@ sor and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ ons or other glu@@ co@@ tics that can be confused via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ol@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the non@@ kidney function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the inter@@ changeable of the H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ tive Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on as@@ Generic with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Normal@@ ratio ) , methods to determine the substance concentration .
in patients who take these drugs simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plas@@ modi@@ ties of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ corrup@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are also low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of toxicity according to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to the entry , this Dar@@ reich@@ ungs@@ shape is contra@@ sted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved in ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ ulous of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to their therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. High @-@ old age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with drugs .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ections , reports of an increase in ble@@ eding , including spontaneous and ha@@ il@@ thro@@ es .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune disease , at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral compres@@ sor ( ART ) can develop an inflammat@@ ory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ae@@ ti@@ ology ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ oses , higher Body Mass Index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral compres@@ sor ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs that have low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with lower therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs which are used predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and for increased plastic bars with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ corrup@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to offset the degra@@ ded plastic bars through a dosage increase of other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed unwanted effects at the liver .
Saint John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ ting mirror of Am@@ corrup@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient already cap@@ tures cur@@ rants are the Am@@ corrup@@ ting mirror and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us load and ab@@ ase the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when pink s@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max decl@@ ining 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ corrup@@ ted capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered for .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ corrup@@ r has been applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and imm@@ atur@@ ity of this therapeutic schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % reduced when Am@@ ron@@ y@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ corrup@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ corrup@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be a nar@@ ro@@ machine monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study done for applying ash@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended because of the viol@@ ated component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the hub of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require a dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ viral to other prot@@ eas@@ ants and available limited data can be suspected that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ corrup@@ r might be sen@@ se@@ ded .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective due to the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic bal@@ es .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical super@@ vis@@ ing should be carried out since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous Gift of Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ene led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by 193 % and thus becomes an increase in associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin dos@@ ed together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine to at least half of the recommended dose even though there are no clinical data available .
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plas@@ m@@ pl@@ agues of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ s@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma rose by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ ear ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ li in comparison to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without the simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ s@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied in common with Asp@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ dependen@@ cies .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , which are connected to this medicine if they are applied in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ections , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it may come to res@@ or@@ p@@ ability .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ corrup@@ r can lead to an humili@@ ation of the plas@@ modi@@ ties of Am@@ destroyed .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ dic@@ pin , stal@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ j@@ pin , N@@ ins@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r , reducing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plas@@ tic@@ ulations and ampli@@ fy with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ om@@ od@@ ine , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at who were given the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plas@@ m@@ asp@@ berry significantly , whereas the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gen@@ res of a@@ Generic with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the possible use of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ol@@ ero@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction plug @-@ ins such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose nar@@ ro@@ p is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pre @-@ shaped enhancements of the plas@@ m@@ ics to be expected with simultaneous administration from A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plastic mass@@ aging of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ tive inhibit@@ ors to my@@ op@@ ia , including a s@@ hab@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plastic concentr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in con@@ current gene manipul@@ ations ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral bi@@ ases ( see section 4.3 ) while being treated with the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ che .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ r@@ acy to other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in the plas@@ tic@@ ulous bars of Mi@@ che @-@ duty around the 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one administered along with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ vot@@ al symptoms , especially if there are also low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there can currently no recommendation be given as the Am@@ corrup@@ ted dosage is to be adjusted when Am@@ corrup@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
in con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of mi@@ tigation or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ m@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ tible , therefore alternative methods are recommended for contrac@@ eption .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in con@@ current gene of as@@ Generic ( see section 4.4 ) .

the thou@@ ght@@ fulness of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment side effects were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and led to the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are applied in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ections could not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 5@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a stolen phenomen@@ al resistance on Fos@@ s@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes made by additional data , and it is recommended to getting the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
on phenomen@@ al resistance @-@ based analyses Clin@@ ically vali@@ dated interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ e data for estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ ur@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ ur@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ ur@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ections drug @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies , who exp@@ el diagnostic resistance tests , have clin@@ ically phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV developed to be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with decreased sensitivity to Am@@ da@@ vi@@ r Associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cru@@ m@@ resist@@ ence against k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data about the Crus@@ ade between Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ ar resistance to resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ s not pre @-@ treated patients , with which a Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ ulates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , int@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 ins@@ ulates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 ins@@ ulates ) .
vice versa keeps si@@ mu@@ avi@@ r his activity against some other prot@@ rac@@ ers @-@ resistant isol@@ ates in ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the ins@@ ulates .
the early departure of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders who can impact on the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , with a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , primarily associated with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ ur@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least an NGO were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ c @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ aligned average change in the output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ basement wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ born as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was used for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low do@@ si@@ zed k@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s associated with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ cally on these data should be considered during treatment optimisation of with PI pre @-@ treated children of the primary benefits of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum drive concentration of Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) administered with Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ ad@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained in@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous nutritional intake influences the extent and rate of Res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be applied to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ guarded penetration of Am@@ corrup@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the fabric .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ les Am@@ corrup@@ r , which represents the active part , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led Am@@ ad@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dosage range supply in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hi@@ ve or to represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily ag@@ gra@@ vi@@ r @-@ exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ accumulative than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram .
also the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neglected , therefore the effect of ren@@ al factor is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r plasma cl@@ amping comparable those that are used to healthy prob@@ es after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ corrup@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ ogen@@ ity with Am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred at doses at dos@@ ages , containing the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r , spoke .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of the hep@@ at@@ mat@@ ologists of the hep@@ atitis and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet solved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from these ex@@ positions data on the human being , both from clinical studies and therapeutic use , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ oto@@ x@@ icity testing , the bacterial , mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te test , micro test test to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , it was di@@ sil@@ ly neither mut@@ ation nor gen@@ oto@@ x@@ ic .
these liver toxic can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ us .
up to date in clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of treatment .
studies on toxicity , treated from an age of 4 days , showed both the control and the animals treated with am@@ ag@@ gra@@ vi@@ r .
for a systemic plasma exposure , the significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) was observed as the anticipated exposure of therapeu@@ tical dosage to humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ le ong@@ ation and s@@ ligh@@ ten sk@@ el@@ eton , which refer to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ Generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily basis of 2400 mg Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with w@@ aking or lighter li@@ er@@ piece with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .

an increased risk for a lift di@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ ctive factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ corrup@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max decl@@ ining 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ corrup@@ ted capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administered for .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ corrup@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ corrup@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but it is recommended to be a nar@@ ro@@ machine monitoring , because the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical super@@ vis@@ ing should be carried out since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ron@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if there is a clinical reasons required to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ ine to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data to be available .

in con@@ current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally Ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of mi@@ tigation or strengthening of anti@@ thro@@ m@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ ba@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .

the application of the application and the duration of the treatment with al@@ dara depend on the infection of the disease . • In case of small bases in the genital area , the cream is applied for six weeks a week . • At small bas@@ al cell cycles , it is applied during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is to move before bed@@ time thin to the affected skin areas so that they will have enough ( approximately eight hrs ) on the skin before they washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared to a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete absorption of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell cancer in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or placebo either weekly or five times a week .
main indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies on a total of 5@@ 05 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • The full healing rate sank in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % in patients with Al@@ dara treated patients , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible inst@@ inc@@ ts in the genital or perio@@ dic area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
a break in the above treatment process should be weigh@@ ed up when intense local inflammation @-@ actions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when in the treatment area an infection is observed .
if follow the follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the lesi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .

if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin promotions , a treatment of treatment can be made of several days .
the clinical result of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months are available after the treatment should be considered with super@@ v@@ ably other suitable therapy forms .

there are only very limited data about applying i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of sac@@ redness of anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ p@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this purpose . therefore , such application is not recommended .
local building actions often appear on , but these reactions tend to take back in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if the local housing campaigns can cause great discomfort or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
the data of an open clinical study reveals that patients with more than 8 AK@@ IR lesi@@ ons are providing a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzy@@ me therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ os@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase ) , in order to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves in connection ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ c@@ ic@@ ans , G@@ ags ) cannot be demol@@ ished and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and compens@@ ate them .
the following non neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , boo@@ sting joints , the movements ru@@ b , reduced lung @-@ volume , cardi@@ ac and o@@ de@@ generative diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be in a hospital or hospital with re@@ traction devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the security of the drug by means of testing , but it has also tested its effectiveness by being investigated regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine was around 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver in the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , pancre@@ atic , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ ong ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the li@@ mbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ esteem , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side @-@ effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , cardi@@ ac cardi@@ ac ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react to patients suffering from severe hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European medicines agency ( E@@ MEA ) will require every year all new information that may possibly be announced , check and review this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is able to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission divided the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell membran@@ es ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries out this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver suff@@ ices were not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any in connection of side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored by machine , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical setting , in which re @-@ charge equipment for medical emergen@@ cies should be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is usually within 3 months starting from treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
given little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk @-@ reaction after an interruption of treatment should be cau@@ tious .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ fung@@ al ) to act to minimize the potential appearance of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and acet@@ am@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed up and / or reducing the in@@ fusion to half of the in@@ fusion in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and acet@@ am@@ amo@@ l / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
in@@ fusion can be taken with a reduction in the input rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion , in which the reaction has occurred to be re @-@ recorded .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and acet@@ am@@ in@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion , in which the prec@@ arious reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because of a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal @-@ experimental studies cannot be detri@@ mental to direct or indirect impact of pregnancy , the embryonic development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which have been expon@@ ened towards Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the breast milk , is recommended , while treating with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not to be breast@@ feeding .
side effects in clinical trials were en@@ acted mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the trial with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug transactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory and lungs in the pre@@ history , heavy reactions occurred in addition , including Bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , brea@@ ths and facial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wished pharmaceutical effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study , with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy grinding form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
for most patients it came within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version , with the patients aged under 5 years with a he@@ avier infection form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) were no ass@@ or@@ able antibodies in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) ass@@ ay veri@@ fiable anti@@ body , including 3 patients with which it never came to serv@@ o version .
patients with lack of low antibodies to a robust decrease in the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in case of patients with high antibodies an variable reduction of G@@ AG was to be as@@ cer@@ tained .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 @-@ study ) showed a margin@@ al to low neutral inhibit@@ or effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing genes in the resin .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be not related to the incidence of unwanted drugs , even though the occurrence of und@@ es@@ irable drugs typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and by cells into the lymp@@ h chromos@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ us recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were raised from the middle @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ e and only one patient pointed out the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an forced explicit volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the estimated FE@@ V and the absolute order in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated against the placebo group an improvement in the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and the in@@ capacity that is shown in the following table .
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in der@@ Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage FE@@ V is not dependent on this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ i@@ eg@@ ram before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the academic year .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease of disease between the patients , which has been considered by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant alter@@ nat@@ al modifications ( an estimated percentage of AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmaceuticals were examined by Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients , which were at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe pun@@ ching form and 4 with the middle lead form ) .
in addition to four patients the dosage was increased because of increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in case of several patients a size growth ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) have been established after the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the average inter@@ run form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle ear @-@ form was limited to a normal mental development speed , whereas the older patients were to be noticed in the cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ist dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dog@@ mas schem@@ ata were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the Leb@@ er@@ volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a responsible alternative ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two acts of dosage is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if required , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients aged under 5 years was similar to the patients older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and reprodu@@ ci@@ ation toxicity , the pre@@ clinical data do not recognize any particular dangers to man .

A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated with patients who have previously not been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
to decrease side effects , patients should be taken during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics &quot; ( medicines for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or when certain other side @-@ effects occur , the treatment should be infl@@ ated , or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes easier in canc@@ er@@ ous cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug by means of a longer period of operation in canc@@ er@@ ous cells .
for the treatment of the Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ ik@@ u , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study on 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease .

during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es , at least 5 doses must be taken and intake must be continued throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ed dose as well as after every third stage of the treatment cycle .
in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es obtained , prior to each gift a complete blood pattern should be created - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a lab@@ yrinth nar@@ ration .
the alkal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 @-@ fold the upper limit value .

after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 ( except neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient gets the value before the treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled when in patients after 2 can @-@ reduction tox@@ ins or not @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so@@ - continues with the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to sufficient data relating to un@@ availability and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance were required by ≥ 45 ml / min none of dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of below 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver with@@ draws from &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Border and / or Tran@@ sam@@ bling of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver cancer ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver cancer ) .
patients must not be monitored with regard to the bone market and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality will once again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neutrality , threads and maximum toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of the level 3 / 4 hä@@ mat@@ ological and non@@ sensi@@ cal toxicity like neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neutr@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been be@@ ating if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients must be instru@@ cted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ id@@ al Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ dly 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es , must take the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ day time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ es ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ inage of the ergometer before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment are weigh@@ ed .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in@@ far@@ es , and cat@@ ch@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of ad@@ den@@ sing vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) Not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .

since the weight reduction can be accompanied by diabetes with improved met@@ abolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic need to be adapted .
patients who take alli , as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures to bend that in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrast eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of drugs as well as in several cases involving the simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plastic bars was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced the Quick values ( international norm@@ ative ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients , treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ rot in the normal range .
however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a complement to the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitamin E ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single @-@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of Volunte@@ er who received at the same time Or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal @-@ experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side @-@ effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of penet@@ rated fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects have been determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects that were determined after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events are voluntarily reported by a population of some certain magnitude .
it is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli made with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects may lead .
individual doses of 800 mg total and multi @-@ specific doses ranging from up to 400 mg three times daily have been handed over for a period of 15 days to norm@@ al@@ ge@@ important and overweight prob@@ ing that occurred without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported in cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side @-@ effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported as at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , it can be assumed by a fast rep@@ ell@@ ation of systemic effects that are due to the li@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect puts in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ente bond to the active ser@@ ene rest of the ga@@ str@@ e and pan@@ ema .
out of clinical studies was derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ts was blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ eable studies due to adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 is confirmed the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , the three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ low , fet@@ ched nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight from the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the previous section was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
with the wa@@ ist circumference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( starting point 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plastic concentr@@ ations of not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral selection of 360 mg of Or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , with therapeutic metering , not met@@ abo@@ des in plasma could be only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a g@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , those who have administered the minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bi@@ ous dose , were able to identify twice ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ ated lacqu@@ ers ) and M3 ( M1 after folding the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , identified as approximately 42 % of the overall plas@@ tic@@ ation concentration .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy therapies that are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chemotherapy therapies that are the trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
Alo@@ xi &apos;s effectiveness can be increased through the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because of the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means the substance of the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate ex@@ tri@@ ers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in chemotherapy therapies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with un@@ grateful patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy therapies , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are showed 81 % of the patients who were treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with on@@ dan@@ qui@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
when compared with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values for 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceu@@ ticals Ltd . a permit for the transport of the market by Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent ac@@ om@@ iting nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting with severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and v@@ om@@ iting with ev@@ oc@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on ass@@ age , patients should be supervised with am@@ nest@@ y tor@@ ches or signs of a subtle i@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is offered at the con@@ current gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or that incl@@ ine to such an extender .
except in connection with other chemical therapeu@@ tics in the days , alo@@ xi will neither be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibit the activity of five examined chemical therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there were no significant pharmac@@ ological interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ ute concentration , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gen@@ res of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ber@@ tin , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , ser@@ f@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie ahead , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is deemed necessary by the pres@@ sive doctor .
in clinical trials the most common ones were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction and reactions to the administration of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of unwanted events appear as in the other do@@ zation groups ; there were no dose of drugs to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a alo@@ xi@@ on over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) was given to intraven@@ ous day 1 without d@@ ran@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ hi@@ ason .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 667 patients who were a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to which 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron were given that given to date 1 intraven@@ ous .
results of studies with wise em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies to the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of the Ap@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the iter@@ ations and re@@ pol@@ arization of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy prob@@ ators was assessing the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
rec@@ or@@ ption Acc@@ ording to intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial acceptance of the plastic concentr@@ ations made out of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ day time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) are generally proportional to the total dosage range of 0,@@ 3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average medium @-@ sized ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simulation calculations , that in once daily doses achieved by 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days the total texts ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ) with which was measured from 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the c@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % will be converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for metabolism , have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , have contributed to I@@ so@@ enz@@ me C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous sol@@ ation of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered activity made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous injection at healthy was the overall body @-@ wheel@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver @-@ functional , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ent semi @-@ permanent and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic expos@@ ures , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From pre @-@ clinical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als which can be involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and the shareholders can extend the potential .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose en@@ gen@@ dered in approximately the 30@@ s of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) which were given daily over two years , led to a greater frequency of liver tum@@ ours , pancre@@ atic , cre@@ tan and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is dedicated to the use of unique application , the relevance of these results is to be minimal .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative credit , in which the for@@ et@@ ation of the approval for the occurrence of hep@@ atitis C is recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmaceu@@ tically efficient component that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference &quot; &quot; &quot; Reference pharmaceu@@ tically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting the ) hep@@ atitis C ( one by a virus infection ) .
in a microsc@@ op@@ ic investigation the liver tissue as@@ signs damage , in addition , the values of the enzy@@ me constra@@ in@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( efficacy structure , composition and purity of the drug , active , safety and efficacy in hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon is compared with the effectiveness of the reference laboratory using an age of 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 out of total 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after hi@@ ring the treatment applied to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have been expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug of the drug have not been inadequate .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C related to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease used more patients back than in the Reference Medi@@ cin@@ al Treat@@ ment ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
aside from this , the test used to investigate the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ush@@ or skin infections ) and small infected in@@ filtr@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or Schn@@ it@@ tw@@ unden ) , abra@@ sions and paraly@@ sed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not be affected .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not addressed after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial infection ( the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was cl@@ amped in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was exp@@ elled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.9 % ) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment .
during the treatment of infected horses , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ efal@@ onia showed similar contact : if the results of both studies were taken together at home sites , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were applied to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of h@@ ash ( low @-@ filled hol@@ low spaces in the body tissues ) or by infections , which were veri@@ fiable , or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contractor .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go outw@@ ei@@ gh the following superf@@ icial skin infections towards the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected little in@@ fir@@ ming , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole of the European Union .
patients with which no improvement could be examined within two or three days should be considered even earlier and an alternative therapy must be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of raising awareness or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve the treatment is to be canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully de@@ br@@ ate and an adequate alternative treatment of infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not supposed to be used for infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficiently .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the small plastic concentr@@ ations , which were reached by humans according to topical application on scr@@ ap@@ ed skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds is a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gen@@ res of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on scr@@ ap@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be held responsible if top@@ ic Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied in a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies have shown a re@@ productive toxicity according to oral care and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effect of the birth and the killing / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ o@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feed continues / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued to be terminated , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go was used the most frequently reported side @-@ effect ir@@ ation at appointments which consider about 1 % of the patients .
operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vatives of plex@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is spoiled by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly plex@@ ig@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial synthesis due to interaction in a particular bond of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the bond of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the bind@@ ings place ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding place and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ ez@@ center .
bond to this binding place in@@ hibit the P@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding and interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub @-@ units .
due to the local prevalence of the resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear in at least some infection forms , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
no differences were determined in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the ins@@ ulates or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were .
in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ one @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
rec@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin p@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plastic cars were won .
the sample took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic recording at people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ered skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ o@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP @-@ in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human@@ oid micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ A4 , under the low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on or@@ ative toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid .
in @-@ vit@@ ro test on gen@@ ome and / or chromos@@ ome effects in the mouse @-@ Ly@@ m@@ op@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood et@@ oc@@ ytes as well as in the rats test @-@ test to in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ investigation chromos@@ ome effects .
there was neither male nor in female rats signs of reduced Fer@@ til@@ ity at oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving a up to 5 times higher exposure to humans ( topical exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ el@@ ter skin :
in an embryo study of rats were calculated 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development tools ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ologic toxicity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect Hepatitis B and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between a and 15 years which are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within a frame of two doses of the plan being used , whereas the protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of H@@ CV @-@ B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can reach an existing vaccine between two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dosage against hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another CV @-@ A@@ - or B @-@ vaccine can be added .
vaccines have the effect that they bring to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; as opposed to a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as that of since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children administered within one of three doses of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for applying Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children that had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibodies of antibodies .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led to the development of protective antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of antibodies against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambitions with a six @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appeal to the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be sensitive to patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ c@@ ine ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission divided the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . a permit for the influ@@ encing of ambition all over the world
the stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her is desired for H@@ CV A as well as for hep@@ atitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccines or with a bin@@ ational material .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) - and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body @-@ values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccines .
it is not yet completely secured , if immun@@ ological people who addressed to a CV @-@ A@@ - vaccination , as they require a re@@ fres@@ her body as protection , as they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 How in all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring always immediately available .
in case a fast protection against hep@@ atitis B is recommended , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination of combin@@ ant , the 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hep@@ atitis B surface surface .
with ha@@ st@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , after pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation patients no need to be sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular administration may result in the glut@@ e@@ muscle for a sub@@ optimal outcomes , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may however be in@@ concl@@ usi@@ vely inj@@ ected because in these cases the in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular gift can come to ble@@ eding .
if Ambi@@ rix had served in the second year in the form of an isolated injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated police type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ king vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ king vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ king vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , the immune response was sufficient on all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly there is no adequate immun@@ isation .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ od@@ ine and preser@@ vatives .
clinical studies were administered by 20@@ 29 vaccines in total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants from 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix were compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses of combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ing on a basis of the calculation of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ utation rate per person .
pain was observed after the gift of ambitions by 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the prob@@ es observed , compared to 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the prob@@ es after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of combin@@ ant .
after the complete vaccination @-@ cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix had administered over pain , over 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - Com@@ bin@@ ational material .
the frequency of mats was however highly high ( i.e. above the whole vaccine with 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix were compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % with the prob@@ es who received the 3 @-@ doses of combin@@ ant .
the frequency of distinctive pain and mat@@ ing was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combin@@ ant with the 3 @-@ doses .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the appearance of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with that in administration with the 3 @-@ doses of combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis A @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface treatment .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - old , however , after vaccination with ambitions , a common appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ecting location ) per dosage , not per pro@@ band , reports .
the proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with its ambitions or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - Un@@ form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B@@ - Sur@@ face filling , was not different statisti@@ cally .
in clinical trials that have been conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ ge rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 } ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serv@@ o conver@@ ge rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
with the 2@@ 89 persons , whose immun@@ ogen@@ ity was adver@@ tised , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP on the table below ) against hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dosage ranges significantly higher than with ambitions .
the immun@@ isation , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vaccines either received a 2 @-@ doses vaccination with ambitions or a 3 @-@ doses vaccination with a combin@@ ation@@ of 360 ELISA units form@@ alised hep@@ atitis A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface treatment .
for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies have been proven to be proven at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambitions in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , which is based on vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of combin@@ ated hep@@ atitis , comprising 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis B @-@ surface treatment in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccines .

a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation of similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the former formulation .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and drinks , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as bathing in the wast@@ ed waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark jungle , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow searches ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot fully protect populations from infection with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is infected before the administration of the two vaccines , Ambi@@ rix already infected with hep@@ atitis A@@ - or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick itself ) , a vaccination may not prevent any vaccination .
protection against other infections caused by the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those following a Hepatitis B or hep@@ atitis B @-@ infection , cannot be im@@ par@@ ted .
• If with you / your child an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or anyone has shown an integral part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ling skin r@@ ashes , breathing difficulties or swelling of the face or the tongue . • if with you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B . • if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before usually intended administration of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambitions .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined CV @-@ A@@ - / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hep@@ atitis B @-@ virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components usually administered one month after the first dose and might give you a vaccine before termination of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix looks at people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened / her child due to illness or treatment in your / his physical defence system , or if you / your child are under@@ going to undergo a her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction is to the vaccine .
21 To your doctor if you take / or take your child further medicines / including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) , or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated , or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) administered or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore does not protect against one or both hep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with ambitions , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible to be vacc@@ inated as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix not suff@@ ice at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix Schw@@ ang@@ eren or nursing women is not administered unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inated both against hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor when you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has been announced for the distribution of the first approval for the invention , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits risk @-@ ratio for ambition has been positive .
since Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete end@@ omet@@ ation or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oton@@ ics ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ ic concentr@@ ations ) in the pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - split up to several single tro@@ users to meals - swal@@ lowed up under the food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a ( through the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or placebo ( a search@@ drug , i.e. with no substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to loss of loss , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , fat pain , om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , v@@ om@@ iting , inc@@ eption , inc@@ ision , mu@@ til@@ ation , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary tract can be effectively prevented .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease there is limited information to this medicine in the time of admission .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients in which a complete end@@ ow@@ ym@@ chan@@ gel has already manifested in the newborn old ( inside the first 28 liver ) .
in patients with a late @-@ proof form ( in@@ complete de@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which mani@@ fests after the first month of life ) is then a indication for the use when in the am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephalopath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein toler@@ ance and that for the growth and development of the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an earliest firm shortage of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with difficulty disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ z@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a occurs when the tablets are not immediately running into the stomach .
every pill AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , corresponding to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ oni@@ tis , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be con@@ ges@@ tive in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium and de@@ formation @-@ related clinical conditions only with caution .
since met@@ abolic isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ation is carried out over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous , from phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to a stolen loss of neur@@ ons .
there also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated from man to breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one und@@ es@@ irable event ( AU ) at least 78 % of these und@@ es@@ irable events was assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ norm@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disease , severe hypo@@ cr@@ ine , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose entered a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , that showed with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ barrier neur@@ oto@@ x@@ icity revealed .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lical active connection that is used by acet@@ am@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine glut@@ amine that is left over the kidneys .
th@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally speaking is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de with urea in similar ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract can be assumed that for each gram , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl @-@ nitrogen nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis procedure early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result .
progn@@ osis of the early @-@ proof form of the disease coinci@@ des with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease was conducted with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ ck@@ ness @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life .
by ha@@ zi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path of nit@@ ro@@ di@@ fication ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ated acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ested K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new @-@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however inside the first month ) of diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oli@@ tic disc , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ resistant shape of the disease ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ine shape of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ i@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oli@@ thic mart@@ yr and a prot@@ ested diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological conditions .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which is implemented in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amic acid , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ abolic disease in Plasma and urine were determined according to gift of an individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after individual reproduction as well as repeated gifts of or@@ tal cans of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gen@@ phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an or@@ ative single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form have been found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ onic mal@@ functions or hem@@ ost@@ o@@ e@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) next morning after closer fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma can be proven .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate acid concentration in plastic bars on the third day 5 times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is re@@ tired within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ate product of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ yr@@ ate with toxic and non toxic doses treated R@@ atten no fl@@ acci@@ dentally effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who are not yet able to swal@@ low tablets or patients with gor@@ ges ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a or a nas@@ al stom@@ a .
according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ on in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an earliest firm shortage of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ ir@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram so@@ dium phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ oni@@ tis , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ o from phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ se .
a probable toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ab@@ norm@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disease , severe hypo@@ cr@@ ine , periph@@ eral neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
th@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally speaking is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ chlori@@ de with urea in similar ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus @-@ weight
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract can be assumed that for each gram , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ phen@@ yl@@ actic acid is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl @-@ nitrogen nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological conditions .
after a or@@ ative single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
during the duration of shelf life the patient can preserve the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measurement of 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring t@@ spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measurement of 8.@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl @-@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the drug over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ al@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the metabolism of proteins in the body after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if at your laboratory studies , you need to notify the doctor that you can take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ is can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the breast@@ feeding period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the drug could move into the breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases were also confusion , head@@ aches , tastes , desc@@ end of the o@@ bedience , Des@@ er@@ edness , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency of your hospital for the introduction of an appropriate treatment .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood circulation to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement at the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
will An@@ gi@@ ox to prevent cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with att@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of one PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox at all of a few gen@@ res or in combination with a gly@@ ph@@ ant @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors ( GP@@ I , a different medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combin@@ ant treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and an GP@@ I .
while PCI has often been a St@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ie to prevent a locking ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac accidents or Rev@@ ask@@ ular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in regards to all indicators as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for serious ble@@ eding in which it was significantly more effective than yeast .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as people with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee for Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI a removable replacement for pi@@ par@@ in is .
September 2004 , the European Commission published The Medic@@ ines Company UK - a permit for the deployment of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ Heb@@ ra@@ in@@ far@@ es ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency handle or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt securing of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if an additional bolt is carried out in the patient in a further consequence , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and the in@@ fusion will be increased for the duration of the operation at 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion of in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bul@@ lock of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous locking of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and efficacy of a all@@ u@@ bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
is this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) can be shortened from 225 seconds to a second bolt of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug was carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ d@@ osis is rapidly administered by intraven@@ ous .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fu@@ sion d@@ osis is administered properly .
in patients with moderate def@@ aults values ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
is the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second bol@@ d@@ dose of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in admission , was the ACT value 5 minutes after gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney injury ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous issue of un@@ question@@ able Hit@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration from lower molecular He@@ at .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or any other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine an active blood @-@ system or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ tly se@@ ab@@ usive hyper@@ tension . • severe kidney disease ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are monitored during the treatment carefully with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ is administered in combination with a different anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if with PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding have to occur in arter@@ ial spots , in patients who undergo a per@@ ut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ary interventions ( PCI ) during treatment in principle anywhere ble@@ eding .
in patients , the war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ is should be considered to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ is reached the level prior to treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( heat in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rot@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these drugs will increase the risk of blood .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological tim@@ ent@@ as@@ e@@ parameters are in any case regularly control .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in the compar@@ isons , it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy ble@@ eding have been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y and TI@@ MI for heavy ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ ers of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding have occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine alone less frequent than in the groups with pi@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ IT@@ Y heavy ble@@ eding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ extraction , intra@@ oc@@ ular blood or blood level required by ≥ 4 g / d@@ l without obvious blood point , repression of the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ omy of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known ble@@ eding , re@@ operation due to a ble@@ eding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood @-@ loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; Punk@@ position , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ us , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine in 6000 patients taking part in one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ Hostel in groups as well as in the compar@@ isons , it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to und@@ es@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding have occurred under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ ors .
the following side @-@ effects that are not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6 .
in the event of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ is is immediate to break off and the patient &apos;s patient with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( among the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm , or as a continuous in@@ fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in the regulation of glu@@ cose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not able to work effectively .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differ slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has a short@@ cut human ins@@ ulin .
the Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ profit ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adult and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
with type 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance of gly@@ ca@@ y@@ li@@ fied h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % was determined after six months ( by 7.3 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal ins@@ ulin .
ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the cans of ap@@ id@@ ra may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood effects .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the S@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ ing@@ Deutschland GmbH to permit a permit for the marketing of ap@@ id@@ ra in the whole of the European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling , the th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ ta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous due to continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdom@@ inal cav@@ ity .
due to the reduced glu@@ co@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin change , the ins@@ ulin can be down into patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change of the active thickness , the brand ( or producer ) , the ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ised delays , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the process of production may draw a change in the ins@@ ulin requirements .
3 A inadequate dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ paying diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ r ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of ins@@ ulin or a ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore be changed when changing the schem@@ as .
among the substances , which can increase blood sugar lo@@ wered activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ tin , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ ine , sul@@ ph@@ yr@@ aldehy@@ de ( ACE ) -@@ in@@ mer , fi@@ dd@@ f@@ yll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ al , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reserves the symptoms of the ad@@ ren@@ gen counter will be weak@@ ened or absent .
animal experimental studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ c@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin regarding pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ enters into the human breast milk , but generally ins@@ ulin occurs neither into the breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ated after oral use .
following are the clinical trials listed from clinical trials , according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing number of their occurrence ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 10 ; common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ( frequency based on the availability of data ) .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a refer@@ enced person , or through intraven@@ ous gift from glu@@ cose to a doctor .
after a glu@@ ing object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to find the urine - cause for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ushes the blood sugar by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral glu@@ cose ( in particular through sk@@ el@@ eton muscle and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be made by ins@@ ulin de@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the activity is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ at norm@@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ l@@ act@@ us , In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dis@@ proportion@@ ate level of furn@@ it@@ ating effect , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportion@@ ate rise in furn@@ it@@ ating effect , just like human ins@@ ulin .
