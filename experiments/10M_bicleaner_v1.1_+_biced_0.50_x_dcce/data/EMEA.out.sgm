<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Prourinary Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) has evaluated the studies in order to take recommendations on drug use.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package address (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets that are in the mouth) as a solution to take (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Make thinking and husks, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • BiolonI disorder, a mental illness, in which the patients may have a mental episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods in normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of female episodes in patients who addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied for fast control of gestational unrest or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">With both diseases, the solution can be applied to the insertion or the melt tables in patients where the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take simultaneously other medicines, who are just like Abilify should be the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripizozole probably acts mainly as a "partial agonists" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripizole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lesser extent acts as the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and to avoid re-occur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, the reoccurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over to one year examined.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been reinstated to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injecting solution was observed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, associated with the Lorazepam (a different antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the alteration of symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies carried out studies in order to investigate how the body has the melting tabletins and the solution to take resorated (asctakes).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies shown with the injecting solution patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms stolen more anxiety than the patients who got a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased Abilify in four of the five short-term symptoms of more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the re-emergence Manic episodes with previously treated patients and if there is additionally an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms stolen and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrateryralis), headache (beats), blaming (slepation), saliva (slepation), saliva (elevated water production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes had on the treatment with Aripiprazole, towards the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injecting unrest and behavioral disorders occur in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bible-I disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to predominate risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bible-workers and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripizole languages (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a cost dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dosage for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bial-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialosis should be considered, if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Inductor is disassembled from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treating with Aripizole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there is no increased supremacy with Aripizole compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripizole should be treated with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myokardinfares or ischaascular diseases, conditions, which predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-resistant medicines) or hypertension (including sacredness and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spatidyskinesia: in clinical studies, one year or less, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripiprazole dyspincorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with an ABILIFY treat patients signs and symptoms of a late dyspinage, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate to a mns or imclear fluber without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medicines, including ABILIFY must be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripizole should be used in patients with varicutations in the Anamnese or in states that are applied with beaters.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripizole in patients with psychosis, associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients, which were treated with Aripizole, a heightened star compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with Fixer Dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted events with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketacacia or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessment of hyperglycaemia related events associated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polymal ie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally prescribed by schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotic medicines, in which weight gain is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle is observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripizole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines with having confine side effects such as secoding (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antony Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorpation rate of Aripizole, but this effect is not relevant to a clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers has a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC of Aripizole around 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") Metabolisians may result in joint application with highly-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripizole compared to CYP2D6 extensively consumables.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you take into consideration the common gift of ketacconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV inhibitors, could have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After completing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors the dosage should be lifted from ABILIFY to the dosage height before the start of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in the Aripike concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripizole per day leaves no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethotan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Warecprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnant during treatment with Aripizole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base to safety during the human being and due to the concerns associated with the animal welfare studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, with other antipsychotics patients should be warned before, dangerous machines, including vehicles, to use until they are safe that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than under placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study conducted over 52 weeks, in patients suffering with Aripizole, an overall lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinchy, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% was in patients under Aripizole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients, which were treated with Aripizole, and 15.1% in patients under gloss-in therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes with biosphere-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients suffering from Aripivoting - treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study on 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripizole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-time period of over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiper treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripizole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, revealed not medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (phatin-phosphate kinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients with Aripizole treated patients, compared to 2,0% of patients with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side-effects that can occur in connection with antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroletic syndrome, spigdyspass and varicutcases, unwanted events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional transitions with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with valued cans of up to 1260 mg and without deaths observed.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a heredialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripizoylbenzene; however, it is unlikely that Bunmodialysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, since Aripizole has a high plastic bandaging.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bial-I disorder is the combination of a participatory effect on serotonin D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripizole showed a high monkey in vitro for dopamine D2- and D3 receptors and a moderate inarity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrengen and for histamin-H1 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in doses from 0,5 up to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy tbanden showed a dosed-dependent reduction of the bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, the Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripizole compared to placebo a statistically significant increase of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Halopidol-controlled study was one week 52 of the proportion of the Responsible patients to teach a response to the study drug, in both groups similarly (Aripizole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which have been defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asuphill-Scale, showed a significantly stronger bettering than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the reverse rate, which was at 34% in the Aripizole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a heap-controlled, multinational twin-blind study on schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients covered and in which the primary study gain 'weight gain' was significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg in an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks combined with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bible-I-disorder Aripizole showed a placebo over 3 weeks in reducing degrading symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks with Fixer dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bivein-I-disorder showed Aripizole compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripizole showed a placebo over placebo over placebo over placebo over 12 weeks compared with the lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripizole also proved to be a comparable share in patients with a symptomatic remission of the Manie, on the basis of lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial, over 6 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bious-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks are not based on lyrics or Valproat-Monotherapy in therapeutic symptoms, compared to monotherapy in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in many patients suffering with Aripizole during a stabilisation phase before Randomisation, showed itself Aripizole against placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar reversal, predominantly in prevention of an residual waste.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro-studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydroxyprops, the N-decycyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination half-life time is roughly 75 hours for Aripizole in extensively over CYP2D6 and roughly 146 hours on 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripizole, there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy subjects, as well as with a pharmacoinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A tanning-specific evaluation of the pharmaceuticals industry yielded no indication of clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the Pharmacology of Aripizole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic characteristics of Aripizole and Dehydro-Aripizole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy proportions.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose-trial at Probanden with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of Aripizole and Dehydro-Aripizole, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which could not be sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity, toxicity, reproducation and canvative potential, the preclinical data could not identify special risks to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxiological effects have been observed only at dosages or expositions that exceed the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have only limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a dose-dependent side-party toxicity (Popofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyosis (AUC) with the recommended maximum bovine animals at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10triple of the middle Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of exposure to humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis has been established as a result of the breakdown of sulphate conjugates from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81HE of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulphate Conjugate of Hydroxylic Aripizole not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and are far below the limits (6%) of the vitro solubility in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">At rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which resulted in Expositions of 3 and 11ignant of the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maxildosis.</seg>

<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no causal connection has been established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules that promotes the decomposition of the microtubules from the TubulIndira and stabilizes the microtubules due to inhibiting their depolation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the mikrotubulary network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitetic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumis conveys Transzytosis from Plasmaelosis in the endothelcells and in the frame of in-vitro studies, it has been proven that the presence of Albumber promotes the transport of Paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transignatal transport through the gp-60-Albuminrereceptor is conveyed and due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (Uted Joacidic Rich in cysteine) is an Paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of myxane for metastatic mammakarzinom is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-bed unverbal studies and by 454 patients, who were treated in a randomised phase III-reference study.</seg>

<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume refers to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or correlation of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacoinetic properties of Paclitaxel were according to intravenous 30-minute subfusion of 260 mg / m2 myxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solitary paclitaxel compared.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of Paclitaxel was higher after myxane-Gabe higher (43%) than after a soluble paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was at myxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro-studies of humanic microsome and tissue assessment, Paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3 "-p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel) metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 myxane in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma was the mean value for cumulative drugs of alcohol with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>

<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of continuous infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronlic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosed independently.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasmics took rapidly from &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Swift disappearance from the great cycle with half-life times ½ α 0,24 and t ½ ß 1.87 hours, followed by a long eliminationary phase with a terminal Elimination period t and ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above and ½ -values) probably represent the fast Resorption in the bones and the excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is in the urine, while the rest is mostly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains uninfluenced by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs duties by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of through Cytochrom P450-Enzymetes, metabolized substances is unlikely, because customs edronic acid at the human being is not metabolized and because it is a wakening or even not a direct and / or irreversible, hydrogen-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patients (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of Zoledrond correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was in the 64 studied patients at the average of 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in fact that light (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive renal factor to down to a kreatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Custedronlic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney disorder (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6triple of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">SubChronic and chronically toxicity in studies with intravenous application was administered in intervals of 0,6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6-minute infusion 0,25 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7,000 of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to well.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Prourinary Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) has evaluated the studies in order to take recommendations on drug use.</seg>
<seg id="750">Acetone is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients). • It can be applied together with another diabolic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) to be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with an sulphylharmacular or insulin, the previous dose of sulphylharmacnuns or insulin can be kept at the beginning of the Actos therapy, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulphyl alcohol or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body-own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level reduced, which makes a type 2-2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">More than 1 400 patients were examined the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with an sulfonylharmacular, in addition they got up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycaylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a reduction in the HbA1c-value, which can be forged that the blood sugar levels were lowered by employing 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletion study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and sulphylbenzene in a reduction of the HbA1c values are 0.94% whereas the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of actos and insulin is examined in 289 patients, patients requiring Actos in addition to insulin is increased by 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who participated in addition to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (diminished sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Acetone may not be used in patients who may also be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver issues, heart failure or diabetic ketoazionale (high Ketonmirror - acid level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos can be used as an alternative to standard treatment (for use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission informed the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited without a permit for the marketing of an account in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, curved, and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also displayed for combining insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and where metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For application of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g., hereditary coronary heart disease or symptomatic coronary heart disease, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain or odems, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure, weight gain and odems, when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A kardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovaskulak disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output Leberenzymeric (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard division) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to the 3 times the upper limit of the normal range is increased, the liver issues are to be monitored again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient Symptoms hints to point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained maleness, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker Harn, are the liver values to verify.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be directed until the duration of the laboratory parameters of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, a dosed-dependent weight gain is proven that can be congestures of fat and in some cases associated with hydration.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hermodifying effect, under the therapy with Pioglitazon a reduced decrease in the middle hemostrotate (relative reduced by 4%) and the hematrrits (relative reduction of 4.3%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin to 3-4%) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sulfonylharmacular and insulin (relative reduction of the hemoglobin to 1-2% and the hematocrrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, in patients, the Pioglitazon as orale branch or triple-combination therapy with insulin is obtained, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic Makulaödems with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems, though patients should report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with the women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.6%; 1,0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants to be pregnant or that occurs, the treatment will be canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions showed that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmacopolies of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin exercises.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reducedmer are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemuzil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) result in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to treatment with pioglitazon which decreases in pregnant hyperinsulin emia and increased insulin resistance of maternity and thus reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; seldom &gt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turmoors and the refraction index of lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon entered ALT-angling over the threefold of the upper limit of the normal range just like under placebo but more often than in comparisons in metformin or sulfonylharmacular.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease, the frequency of a severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6 percent higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch has rarely been reported about incongestive heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events with regards to bonding, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (5.6%) of the patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to operate via an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Promelator Accountants Accior-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin of liver, obesity, and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces the glucosity production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosity in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus gliclazide as monotherapy was continued for two years to investigate the time up to the aftermath of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placeboarding study about 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate despite three-onatical optimizing phase with insulin or randomised to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c reduced itself by 0.45%, compared to patients who continue to only insulin; a reduction of insulin metering in the group treated with Pioglitazon treated.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year, under Pioglitazon has shown an statistically significant decrease in the album / Kreatinin-Quotized compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, study on type 2-diabetics in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the overall plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found under Pioglitazon no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under Metformin and Gliclazide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride, but also improved the postprandial made of glyceride levels, this both on a effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a kardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease in groups, which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either joglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon in plasma is usually 2 hours to application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis the contribution of M-IV belongs to effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, the pioglitazon could not have a relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmacopolies of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin exercises.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemuzil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8-Inductor), or reduces the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans the marker was found mainly in the fetal (55%) and to a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination range of unaltered pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 to 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plastic concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolic disease are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy probands, with the rarities of the oral clearing of the uterine distances.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration-volume enlarging with heretics, anaemia and irreversible coronary heart hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to treatment with pioglitazon which decreases in the shape of hyperinsulin emia and increased insulin resistance of the uterine and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induces to the rat increased by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family-material polyposis (FAP) introduced the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions to an increased incidence of collagen.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient-years with the women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.6%; 1,0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, were examined by Pioglitazon or Gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, under Pioglitazon indicated a statistically significant decrease in the album / Kreatinin-Quotized compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride, but improved in addition the postprandial made of glyceride levels, this both on an effect on the tracglyceride absorption and the hepatitis Trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacked the target with regard to their primary endpoint, which is a combination of the totality, non-deadly myokardinfares, stroke, acute coronary synarisation and Revvascularization of the leg arteries, lay the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon no cardiac-long-term risks are associated.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the 'ACTOS'.</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events with regards to bonding, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients, which received with Pioglitazon, showed an increased incidence of bone armament amongst women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to study cardiovascular events, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.6%; 1,0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus level, during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be supervised by Prograf on Advagraf, Dosisadaptation, changes to immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances, which could change the Tacrolimus full-blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low Clearance, adjustments to the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the lower levels in the blood will not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the slows of Tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplants usually occurs in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in renal transplants patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations were generally used in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in severe undesirable events, including transhings, or other side-effects that may occur in succession of Tacrolimus under- or oversight.</seg>

<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions formed to a substitution of the Tacrolimbic level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the Johanniskwort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal medicines used during treatment with advanced payment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimbic concentrations offered in the blood, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to significant variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, Prograf was to be observed as cardiac opathy, or in septic hypertrophia, which therefore can also be found at Advocraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinician disorders, are an already existing heart suffering, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid exposure and oiling.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the impact of sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of skin lesions by appropriate clothing or using a solar protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the available data, the CHMP has evaluated the benefits risk-risk to be assessed as positive, but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSYs every 6 months, decided that the admission fee should apply in 5 years to advance.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited registered with the Committee for Humpharma (CHMP) officially that the company takes its application for approval for the marketing of an Advexin for treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in the Advocin" "" "is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has changed so that there cannot produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infection in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have sinjected directly into the tumors and thus to make the cancerous cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from which not broken in the human body existing p53-gene, usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to kill the cells if DNA does not want to be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53-Gen is defective, the p53-protein is not working properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study with a patient before, with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the sub-tree, in bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had tested the answers of the company on the questions posed there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial publication of the initial documents the CHMP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, not sufficiently proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni Tumors brings benefits to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug by means of the body, the type of administration, and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not adequately proven that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The Company did not notice the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently has to participate in clinical studies or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing" metabolism "means that the tablets are put together so that one of the effective constituents will be released instantly and the other is slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen of the nasal infection) in patients with nasal mucosa skin (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and young people aged 12 years the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced upon the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the gravure of the hay-nymptomy that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary, and evaluated with a standard scale, how hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay dernymptomy except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the aerinaze receipts, about a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patient, the pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was regarded, the patients showed under Aerinaze an alleviation of the symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients who infuse desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykarmic, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (appeal), seizure, headaches, fatigue, insomnie (sleeplessness), somnolenz (beats), sleeping disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may be used in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicine to treat allergies) are not being used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (hypertension), heart, or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyic stroke (hypertension of the thyroid) or already have a hemorrhema stroke (hypertension) or already have a risk for a hemorrhema stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the influencing of aerobaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallow in the whole (i.e. without disclosing, break or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be used due to the failure of data to untreatable and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not being used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use of application to 10 days since long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After slowing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper breathing exercises, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindexed in patients suffering with a monoamintoxase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other Vasoconstrictors, pergoid, cabbage, diarrhoea, diarrhoea, phenylpropanolamin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, Napcaolin (etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been tested for this patient collective and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerosaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed about the treatment at the occurrence of a hypertension or a tonic, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any eventual other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of headache) must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patients is advised to be taken care of: • patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardium infarmed in the Anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronze passerene in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to conducting dermatological tests, since Antihistamines will otherwise hinder positive reactions to indicators for housing campaigns or reduce it to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">As part of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole have also been administered in addition, however, were not clinically relevant interdependencies or changes in the plastic concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests could not be identified any significant differences between those treated with desloratadine and those with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadine alone or with alcohol has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">DESloratadine is inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-Glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The implanting of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transmitted to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictoral properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be elucidated that in very rare cases, it may come to a stuper that may lead to an impairment of the sightedness, or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms can vary between a ZNS depression (Sedierung, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, coronary heart collapses) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations) with potential letterations.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, scarcely Miktion, muscle atrophy and increased muscle tension, euphoria, carditis, perspiration, vomiting, vomiting, canvase, tinnitus, tendons, mercies, and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as Atropical in-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupilleninre and - dilatation, skin creams, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of prospecting cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Master cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the noetic molecule P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single-dose study with adults desloratadin 5 mg does not affect standard output ranges, including the amplification of subjective beats or the tasks associated with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials included at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, no increased incidence of beats compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause further likeable effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tick-karmic or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze Tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determines based on the overall base cores for the symptom (except nasal infections), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets with regard to the decrease effect, determined by the nose grinding skin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets showed no significant differences in view of sex, age or ethnic group.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose of Pharmacology from Aerinaze, desloratadine is proven in 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow rate of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine is reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacoinetic multi-dosed study, which was carried out with the formulation as tablets in healthy adult subjects, has been noted that four subjects disinterns desloratadin badly changed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component Interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) from Pseudoephedrine, after the allrabe of pseudoephedrine bioaccumulative was for exposure to gift of a aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security harmacology, toxicity for repetitive tolerance, to treat genotoxicity and Reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data can be recognized with desloratadin however no special risks to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In the combination of catological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was in the oral gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 the authorisation has been established for the application of pharenvigilanzee and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was involved in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies with seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the paddles, impairment of sleep and the efficiency on the day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There have been presented further studies to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to take and take the glazing in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of astronomically (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% compared to patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria was the decrease of the symptom after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe held a permit for the influencing of aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once daily, with a or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intercomfy and persist allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials to effectiveness in the application of desloratadine for young people from 12 to 17 years old (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be completed in accordance with the recent disease progression and may end up after the end of the symptoms and be re-recorded at their re-occur.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the Persian's allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interdependencies were not found in the framework of clinical studies involving desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or Ketoconazole have also been administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the incidence of Aerius and alcohol has not been reinforced by alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should be elucidated about it in very rare cases to rams that may lead to an impairment of the sightedness, or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urine, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg every day 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently used side-effects reported on the more common than in placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouthiness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">During a clinical trial involving 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side of side headaches that occurred at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-disciplinary research study, where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninth clinical dose) were not observed, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of prospecting cytokines such as IL-4, IL-8, IL-8 and IL-13 from human Master cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the noetic molecule P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Within the framework of a clinical study involving multi-professional doses, in a dosage range of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistical significant or clinically relevant cardio effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadine is administered for in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the Neofold of clinical dose) over ten days was not shown by an extension of the QTc Intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single-dosed study involving adults, DESloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard output ranges, including the amplification of subjective strokes or the tasks associated with the fly.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviation of symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itch of the nose, itching, laces, and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and Perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into dependence upon the duration of symptoms, alternatively also in interacting allergic rhinitis and persist rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Associated allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persian's allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the entire process of cargo to the quality of life at Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminishes the due to seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urine was deprective for further forms of anti-specimen, since the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology in the various forms is similar and chronic patients can be simpler to be prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the Histaminunisment is a sutational factor in all urinary disorders, is expected to result in desloratadine besides the chronic idiopathic Urtikaria also in other forms of anti-fungal infections; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of quantity and number of paddles at the end of the first dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines at chronic idiopathic urine, the minority of patients, who are not reacted on antihistamines, from the study was excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itch by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine treated patients compared to 19% of patients with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with aerius reduced the disruption of sleep and vigor as significant as measured by a 4-point scale to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmaceutical research study, in which the patient-demographics were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis -Population, was achieved with 4% of the patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>

<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, however, may delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, which were previously not treated with protections.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The enhanced crushed Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, who had previously taken protections, with other protections.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Major indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with unproven concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the transformation of Virus last after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protections, although after 48 weeks under Agenera more patients had a Viruslast among 400 copies / ml than under placebo but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children having reduced Agenerase also the Virus last, however, were treated by the children who had previously been treated with protections, very few to the treatment spoke.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, who had been treated earlier with demonstrators had been treated earlier with Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase the Virlet last after 16-week treatment as effectively as other proteasants:</seg>

<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amcorrupr has been applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and immaturity of this therapeutic schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduced when Amronyr (750 mg twice daily) in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amcorrupr (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amcorrupr (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg konavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage adjustment for the simultaneous administration of Amronavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but it is recommended to be a narromachine monitoring, because the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacoinetic study done for applying ashase in combination with didanosin, but is recommended because of the violated component of Didanosin, that the income of didanosin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the hub of Efavirenz in combination with Ambaavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) does not require a dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ambaavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasants would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Neviral to other proteasants and available limited data can be suspected that Nevirapin the serum concentration of Amcorrupr might be senseded.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin might be less effective due to the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic bales.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological supervising should be carried out since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Amronavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous Gift of Ammonavir and Rifabuene led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by 193% and thus becomes an increase in associated with rifabuine side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin dosed together with Agenerase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabuine to at least half of the recommended dose even though there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmakokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasmplagues of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>

<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors from CYP3A4, can be applied in common with Aspase, possibly to interdependencies.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions, which are connected to this medicine if they are applied in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protections, it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it may come to resorpability.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsiva, which are known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amcorrupr can lead to an humiliation of the plasmodities of Amdestroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium, Diltiazem, Feldicpin, staldipin, Nijpin, Ninsdipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 through Amronavir, reducing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasticulations and amplify with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with side-effects including hypotomodine, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1990">Since plastic massaging of these HMG-CoA-reductive inhibitors to myopia, including a shabyolysis, the combined application of these medicines with Ambaavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to the stabilization of the mirror, since the plastic concentrations of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased in concurrent gene manipulations (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be applied together with oral biases (see section 4.3) while being treated with the simultaneous use of Agenerase with parental Miche.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenterracy to other protector inhibitors to a possible increase in the plasticulous bars of Miche-duty around the 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone administered along with Ambaavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opivotal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se low reliability of historical comparisons, there can currently no recommendation be given as the Amcorrupted dosage is to be adjusted when Amcorrupr is administered at the same time with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In concurrent gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of mitigation or strengthening of antithromtic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive is not predictible, therefore alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in concurrent gene of asGeneric (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambaavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amadavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady-State (Cmin, ss) remained inaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous nutritional intake influences the extent and rate of Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be applied to a large distribution volume as well as an unguarded penetration of Amcorrupavir from the bloodstream into the fabric.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbundles Amcorrupr, which represents the active part, probably unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbundled Amadavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosage range supply in the Steady-State over the area of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the security of the drug by means of testing, but it has also tested its effectiveness by being investigated regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme the GAG concentrations in the urine was around 60%, and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver in the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, pancreatic, skin rash, arthrong (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-esteem, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side-effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of the pulmonary function), cardiac cardiac (accelerated heart rate), fever and shook.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react to patients suffering from severe hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is able to observe the Aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission divided the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal-cell membranes (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is used to long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mukopolysaccharisocket I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase-deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who owns experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries out this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dosage of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver suffices were not determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients may develop infusion-related reactions, which are defined as any in connection of side-effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be monitored by machine, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be carried out only in a reasonable clinical setting, in which re-charge equipment for medical emergencies should be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG-antibodies against laronidase is usually within 3 months starting from treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution when applying aldurazyme with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Given little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk-reaction after an interruption of treatment should be cautious.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antifungal) to act to minimize the potential appearance of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of an easy or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and acetamamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed up and / or reducing the infusion to half of the infusion in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease, treatment with antihistamines and acetamamol / Ibuprofen is to consider.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be taken with a reduction in the input rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion, in which the reaction has occurred to be re-recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and acetaminophen / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion, in which the precarious reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or Procain because of a potential risk of interference with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal-experimental studies cannot be detrimental to direct or indirect impact of pregnancy, the embryonic development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As no data to newborns, which have been exponened towards Laronidase via the breast milk, is recommended, while treating with Aldurazyme is not to be breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were enacted mainly as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the trial with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug transactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase-3 study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequent (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory and lungs in the prehistory, heavy reactions occurred in addition, including Bronchospasm, breaths and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwished pharmaceutical effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phas- 2 study, with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavy grinding form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">For most patients it came within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a serokonversion, with the patients aged under 5 years with a heavier infection form (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study) were no assorable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay verifiable antibody, including 3 patients with which it never came to servo version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibodies to a robust decrease in the GAG Spiegels in Harn, while in case of patients with high antibodies an variable reduction of GAG was to be ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2-study) showed a marginal to low neutral inhibitor effect on enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro, which seemed to impair the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing genes in the resin.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be not related to the incidence of unwanted drugs, even though the occurrence of undesirable drugs typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulating substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and by cells into the lymph chromosomes, most likely about Mannosis-6-phosphorus receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placeable phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were raised from the middle-phenotype and only one patient pointed out the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an forced explicit volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">Primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the estimated FEV and the absolute order in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme treated against the placebo group an improvement in the pulmonary function and the incapacity that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 208 weeks in derAldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage of the percentage FEV is not dependent on this period of clinically and the absolute pulmonary volume, increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with a Hepiegram before treatment reached 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG mirror was established in the Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant until the academic year.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease of disease between the patients, which has been considered by using a combined end point, the clinically significant alternatal modifications (an estimated percentage of AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-year-2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmaceuticals were examined by Aldurazyme in 20 patients, which were at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years old (16 patients with the severe punching form and 4 with the middle lead form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In addition to four patients the dosage was increased because of increased GAG- mirror in the Harn in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In case of several patients a size growth (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) have been established after the Z-score for this age group. the younger patients with the average interrun form (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle ear-form was limited to a normal mental development speed, whereas the older patients were to be noticed in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacist dynamic effects of various Aldurazyme-dogmas schemata were performed on the GAG mirror in the Harn, the Lebervolume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>

<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmacoinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous genres of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Dxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubicin, Fluxorubbertin, Ranitidine, serfavir, sertralin and Terbinafine) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies do not lie ahead, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is deemed necessary by the pressive doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials the most common ones were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reaction and reactions to the administration of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of unwanted events appear as in the other dozation groups; there were no dose of drugs to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy with a aloxion overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours) was given to intravenous day 1 without dranamethashiason.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who were a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron, with patients compared to which 32 mg of Ondansetron were given that given to date 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with wise emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies to the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondanetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of the Aponosetron, Palonosetron has the ability to block the iterations and repolarization of the Ionenkanals and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy probators was assessing the ECG effects of i.V. administered Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Recorption According to intravenous gift follows an initial acceptance of the plastic concentrations made out of the body with an average terminale half-day time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plastic concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-) are generally proportional to the total dosage range of 0,3 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average medium-sized (± SD) increase in Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulation calculations, that in once daily doses achieved by 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days the total texts (AUC0-) with which was measured from 0.75 mg; however, the cmax was higher than 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% will be converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism, have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, have contributed to Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous solation of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered activity made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous injection at healthy was the overall body-wheelance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver-functional, the terminale Eliminent semi-permanent and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposures, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical studies suggest that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of Ionenkanals which can be involved in ventricular De- and repolarization and the shareholders can extend the potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (every dose engendered in approximately the 30s of the therapeutic exposure to humans) which were given daily over two years, led to a greater frequency of liver tumours, pancreatic, cretan and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is dedicated to the use of unique application, the relevance of these results is to be minimal.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) adopted a negative credit, in which the foretation of the approval for the occurrence of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same pharmaceutically efficient component that has already been approved in the EU (also called" Reference "" "Reference pharmaceutically" "" ")." ""</seg>

<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that occupy the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (efficacy structure, composition and purity of the drug, active, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon is compared with the effectiveness of the reference laboratory using an age of 455 patients.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the drug of the drug have not been inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A were similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease used more patients back than in the Reference Medicinal Treatment; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test used to investigate the question, to what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (one with crushor skin infections) and small infected infiltrations (Rissor or Schnittwunden), abrasions and paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infections may not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressed after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial infection (the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby hibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was clamped in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was expelled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.9%) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">During the treatment of infected horses, Altargo and Cefalonia showed similar contact: if the results of both studies were taken together at home sites, about 90% of the patients of both groups were applied to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo was found in the treatment of hash (low-filled hollow spaces in the body tissues) or by infections, which were verifiable, or presumably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections towards the risks: • Impetigo, • infected little infirming, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd., approval for the transport of Altargo in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement could be examined within two or three days should be considered even earlier and an alternative therapy must be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salve the treatment is to be canceled, the ointment carefully debrate and an adequate alternative treatment of infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not supposed to be used for infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2- to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plastic concentrations, which were reached by humans according to topical application on scraped skin or infected superficial wounds is a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous genres of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the medium retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on scraped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients can not be held responsible if topic Retapamulin is applied in a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">"" "" "" "animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral care and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the effect of the birth and the killing / postnatal development (see Section 5.3)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of retapoulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeed continues / ends or the therapy with Altargo continued to be terminated, is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo was used the most frequently reported side-effect iration at appointments which consider about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of plexuromutilin, a substance that is spoiled by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly plexigotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial synthesis due to interaction in a particular bond of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the bond of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bindings place ribosomales protein L3 involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding place and the Peptidyltransferasezcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Bond to this binding place inhibit the Puromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P-binding and interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of the resistance, the use of retapamulin should appear in at least some infection forms, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were determined in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin towards S.aurreus regardless of whether the insulates or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Pantone-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Recorption In a study with healthy adults became 1% reapamulin pbe daily under occlusion to intact and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plastic cars were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sample took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at people after topical application of 1% salbe on 200 cm2 deered skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapoulin IC50 for the PGP-inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in humanoid microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP2CA4, under the low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on orative toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect Hepatitis B and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between a and 15 years which are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within a frame of two doses of the plan being used, whereas the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of HCV-B infection and is ensured that the vaccine can reach an existing vaccine between two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dosage against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another CV-A- or B-vaccine can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have the effect that they bring to the immune system (the natural defences of the body) "as opposed to a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as that of since 1996 approved vaccine Twinrix adults and the vaccine since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix children administered within one of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for applying Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children that had developed one month after the last injection a protective antibodies of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambitions with a six-month distance between the injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appeal to the injecting, redness, mating (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive to patients who may not be hypersensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycine (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission divided the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for the influencing of ambition all over the world</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for prioritisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is desired for HCV A as well as for hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalants vaccines or with a binational material.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HAV) and anti-hepatitis C (anti-HAV) - and anti-hepatitis C (anti-HAV) antibody-values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalants vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely secured, if immunological people who addressed to a CV-A- vaccination, as they require a refresher body as protection, as they are also protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How in all injections should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring always immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In case a fast protection against hepatitis B is recommended, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination of combinant, the 360 ELISA units formininactivated hepatitis A-Virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hastalysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, after prioritisation patients no need to be sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intra-muscular administration may result in the glutemuscle for a suboptimal outcomes, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With Thrombozytopenie or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may however be inconclusively injected because in these cases the intra-muscular gift can come to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix had served in the second year in the form of an isolated injection, Tetanus-, Tetanus-, inactivated police type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masking vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masking vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined masking vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib), the immune response was sufficient on all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must be assumed that possibly there is no adequate immunisation.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matritis, headaches and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier Thiomodine and preservatives.</seg>
<seg id="2751">Clinical studies were administered by 2029 vaccines in total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants from 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix were compared with that of the 3-doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mating on a basis of the calculation of Ambirix, but not on a computation rate per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of ambitions by 50,7% of the probes observed, compared to 39,1% in the probes after the gift of a dose of 3-doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination-cycle 66.4% of the probanden, the Ambirix had administered over pain, over 63.8% at the probanden who had been vaccinated with the 3-dos- Combinational material.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of mats was however highly high (i.e. above the whole vaccine with 39.6% of the probanden, the Ambirix were compared to 36.2% with the probes who received the 3-doses of combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of distinctive pain and mating was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combinant with the 3-doses.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccines the appearance of local actions and general actions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with that in administration with the 3-doses of combinated hepatitis A-A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11- old, however, after vaccination with ambitions, a common appearance of pain (at the injecting location) per dosage, not per proband, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported on severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with its ambitions or during the 3-doses vaccine with 360 ELISA- Unformininactivated hepatitis A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B- Surface filling, was not different statistically.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that have been conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years, the seroconverge rates for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6} (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The servo converge rates for anti-hbs were 74.3% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, which was conducted at 12- until including 15-year-old, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 the standard combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 persons, whose immunogenity was advertised, the seroprotational rates (SP on the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3-dosage ranges significantly higher than with ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunisation, which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines either received a 2-doses vaccination with ambitions or a 3-doses vaccination with a combinationof 360 ELISA units formalised hepatitis A-Virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of prioritisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies have been proven to be proven at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambitions in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix had only been placed in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete endometation or with hyperammonotonics (brain damage as a result of high ammoniacic concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split up to several single trousers to meals - swallowed up under the food or via a gastrostoma (through the abdominal blanket into the stomach of leading hose) or a nose sonde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonaps did not compare with another treatment or placebo (a searchdrug, i.e. with no substance).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanpharma (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disturbances of the urinary tract can be effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because due to the rarity of the disease there is limited information to this medicine in the time of admission.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients in which a complete endowymchangel has already manifested in the newborn old (inside the first 28 liver).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-proof form (incomplete dezymdefective, which manifests after the first month of life) is then a indication for the use when in the amnese a hyperammonary encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and that for the growth and development of the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Natriumphenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an earliest firm shortage of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase is the substitution of Citquirlin or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered patients with difficulty disorders, as a risk for the emergence of Özophagusulcera occurs when the tablets are not immediately running into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every pill AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylonitis, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be congestive in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium and deformation-related clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic isation and excretion of sodium phenylation is carried out over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindexed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous, from phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of neuronal multiplication and to a stolen loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established if phenylacetate is eliminated from man to breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during the breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients at least one undesirable event (AU) at least 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old abnormtic patient, which developed a metabolic disease, severe hypocrine, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose entered a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, that showed with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosisbarrier neurotoxicity revealed.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolical active connection that is used by acetamamine to phenylacetate glutamine glutamine that is left over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Thchiometrically speaking is phenylacetylchloride with urea in similar (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetate glutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary tract can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylphenylyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetyl-nitrogen nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis procedure early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Prognosis of the early-proof form of the disease coincides with the appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always infaust, and the disease was conducted with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stickness-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hazialysis, the use of alternative path of nitrodification (sodium phenylated acetate), protested Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of new-born at postpartal (however inside the first month) of diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonolitic disc, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many other intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-resistant shape of the disease (including feminine patients with the heterozygine shape of the Ornithinicarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonolithic martyr and a protested diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and some patients may occur further deterioration of neurological conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate which is implemented in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamic acid, whereby phenylacetyl glutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolic disease in Plasma and urine were determined according to gift of an individual dose of 5 g sodium hydrochlorine and with liver cirrhosis after individual reproduction as well as repeated gifts of ortal cans of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous genphenyl-butyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an orative single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrate in tablet form have been found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma-concentrations of phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with uronic malfunctions or hemostoeopathies, after different doses phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) next morning after closer fasting, no phenylacetate in the plasma can be proven.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium phenyl-butyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate acid concentration in plastic bars on the third day 5 times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is retired within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjuate product of phenylacetate glutamine about the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: inextraction, intraocular blood or blood level required by ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood point, repression of the hemostgloomy of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to a bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood-localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" Punkposition, retroperitoneal, gastrous, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bivalirudine in 6000 patients taking part in one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the BivalirHostel in groups as well as in the comparisons, it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding have occurred under Bivalirudin significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side-effects that are not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of overdose the treatment with Bivaliris is immediate to break off and the patient's patient with regard to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the Anirombtie-region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is tied at the liquid phase or at a straightforwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of bias in Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin is slowly splits on the one hand the attachment of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly and thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, thanks to Bivalirudin with Serum of patients, in which it was at the past to piparinduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had to induce a medallized unit campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy test and in patients Bivalirudine shows Bivalirudin a dosis- and concentration-dependent anticulatory effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI has been conducted in the patient below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivaliris should be added and the infusion will be increased for the duration of the intervention to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionable Heparin or Enoxaparments was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Koronarsynsyndrome (ACS) in patients with instable Angina / non-ST-Hebgen (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to get an GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors either before the start of the angiography (at the time of Randomisation) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk potentials, which required a angiography within 72 hours required, evenly over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacoinetic properties of Bivalirudin have been evaluated in patients who undergo a perutaneous Koronarges (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivaliris invaded as Peptid a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaboo that results from the splitting of the Arg3-Pro4 bond of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin results, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (among the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm, or as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not able to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin differ slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter period of action has a shortcut human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The Apidra was used in combination with a long-profit insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adult and a study of 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">With type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effective, apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance of glycaylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% was determined after six months (by 7.3% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of the HbA1c-concentration was 0.46% after six months with apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of apidra may have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood effects.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission granted the Sofi-AvingDeutschland GmbH to permit a permit for the marketing of apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is considered subcutaneous injecting either in the field of abdominal ceiling, the thigh or delta or subcutaneous due to continuous infusion in the field of abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucoogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin change, the insulin can be down into patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active thickness, the brand (or producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, galvanised delays, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the process of production may draw a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or the breakage of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-paying diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoazir; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or a insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances, which can increase blood sugar lowered activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemics, angiotenstin, angiotensine, sulphyraldehyde (ACE) -inmer, fiddfyllin, propoxyal, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserves the symptoms of the adrengen counter will be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies showed no differences between Insuclinglulisin and humaninsulin regarding pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether Insulinglulisenters into the human breast milk, but generally insulin occurs neither into the breast milk, nor is it resorated after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the clinical trials listed from clinical trials, according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing number of their occurrence (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 10; common: ≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: (frequency based on the availability of data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - exhausting, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, confusion, uncommon creation or weakness, confusion, concentrations, bends, pancakes, nausea and heart-pat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Licensing ystrophy has failed to change the injecting location within the injection range, can occur in the result of a lipodystrophy on the injecting location.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) that is given by a referenced person, or through intravenous gift from glucose to a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluing object, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to find the urine - cause for the severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin pushes the blood sugar by the stimulation of the peripheral glucose (in particular through skeleton muscle and fat) as well as by the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous ga- be made by insulin deulisin the efficiency occurs faster and the activity is shorter than with hu- manat norminsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes mlactus, Insulinglulisin in therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate level of furnitating effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in furnitating effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a twice as fast action as normal human insulin and achieves the complete anger of humanitarian action about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Out of the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postpranal glycaemic control will be reached like with humanic normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was reached Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-rangeal control than with humanic normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If Insulinglulisin 15 minutes after the commencement of the meal, there is a comparable glycaemic control like at humanic normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- grooves in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal compared to humanic normal ulin, which was given 30 minutes (figure 1A) as well as compared to humanic normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
