if a part of the text is selected , only this part is part of the entire &amp; URL .
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ y@@ fish produced in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense . therefore , the translations should not be made on important decisions without re@@ viewing the translation before .
only web pages on the internet can be translated . other texts should you be translated on the bab@@ y@@ fish page yourself where you can insert them into translated texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings . open the card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list with standard configuration modules from KDE ; add@@ ons . please note that there are more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on the extras . then you can see the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for a crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if available , delete .
the module &apos;s module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras ) . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s updated work directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M Bau@@ man@@ View in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; use the DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ate element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ yed folders hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is separated by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can then easily be detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ se @-@ presentation , a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . easier navigation have the right @-@ edge meaningful color and let@@ tering .
the colour of a rectangle that is switched on color mode , can be either a depth for the easy detection of the screw sti@@ ff or picture of a different file editor , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature you can specify whether it is at all indicated , only when enough space to display is available or if the area of the subordin@@ ate rectangle are to occur ( though , dis@@ appearing errors by restrictions on the character of the tre@@ ad ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tions in the rectangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ se in &amp; FS@@ View ; this aim is not always respected . it will be frame for the casing &apos;s entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square .
as part of the area of an entry to the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to it . this is , it is necessary for the def@@ aults and to avoid space losses due to the means that right angles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive cement .
you can specify the minimal space for an entry over the menu entry view in the area . instead , a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module photos can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under extras @-@ picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
if you access the module picture gallery , a dialogue opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery .
the option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture page in a text field .
the option pictures per line has a sli@@ der and a script to adjust the number of mini@@ ons each line in the gallery .
with the tick@@ ed box file name of the image , you decide whether the fil@@ en@@ ames below the mini @-@ images are displayed in the gallery .
with the tick@@ eting file size of the image , you determine whether the file size is displayed among the mini @-@ images in the gallery .
with the cross @-@ box image size , you determine whether the size of images under the mini @-@ images can be displayed in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in file selection , save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the cross @-@ box sub@@ folder , you can configure a sli@@ der or a screen@@ play until which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
with the Pictures , you can copy whether the original images are to be copied into the gallery .
using the Connec@@ tions Com@@ mentary file you can use a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the cross @-@ field of own color @-@ depth , you can set for the mini @-@ looking images to adjust another color @-@ depth than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML module provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML @-@ settings for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML , settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under extras , settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use it to review and correct your photos , to evaluate and correct . the editing capabilities may be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ pack is ; easy to use , it provides recep@@ tive professional skills . it works complete in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ ts by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC shades .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; KDE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tised ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to make reporting of problems or improvements as easily as possible for them . if you are using this link@@ age menu , your web browser will open a page in the event report . all required information are already registered here . follow the instructions to submit your report .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; is a project which is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tization ; then you may already answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ tization ; and hopefully soon you have questions to other users . in this mailing list , you should be spoken in English language , so you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; home page to read news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ tization ; is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for contacting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
when you get &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder , or click the folder icon symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the datas@@ he@@ ets is stored . this path remains the same for all picture folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . Settings checks in the collections .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , which contains a base folder . &amp; digi@@ tised ; viewed any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the passing of the folder you will have a progress show as to see :
&amp; Wh@@ ence came ; thir@@ sty the Bibli@@ oth@@ ec@@ tory in its entire depth . you can not lock any sub@@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in pet@@ ri@@ fied folder . this allows you to insert extra @-@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ tization ; take a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will have no photos as symbols . you can change the ones by taking any photo from the album and take this on the folder icon . more details on this can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ tization ; your digital camera set up . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My cat@@ ch@@ list to manage your photos in the albums .
blan@@ ket support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help resource support .
as you set up this and work with raw files , it is described in paragraphs Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ o@@ des and Ro@@ h operations .
an easy to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and each card reader , which is supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; work together .
modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the computer . the camera can then be realized as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized using the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; Control came ; used the program g@@ photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , extended software collection for digital cameras , which has a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to billing and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port , this connection has now become obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support for it to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ tis@@ am . the EX@@ IF support is not present in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might have view@@ able images , or the generation might be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to be digi@@ tised , is how easy its functionality is to be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common mod@@ al structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , k@@ Photo@@ graphs , Sho@@ es and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way , as there is also a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to supplement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ come ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
tigh@@ tening and disc@@ ard images everywhere : you can take a picture in a different part of the tree @-@ tree , on the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image does not contain in keywords , file list or browse .
- a file selection enables you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar . thus , the filtering is displayed on the fil@@ ename only when this ind @-@ window will also be displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog box settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; introduces a organized view to your photo albums . all photos , which were developed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; these albums can be stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created , sorted out . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose an album Import pictures . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . choose an album Im@@ ported scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album and drop it . in the then you &apos;ll have to select whether the image is moving from moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allowing you to access information about this collection . to access the album features , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and edit in the context menu entries .
Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can select your photos under a common name . if you choose from collection , select or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums at the date .
the Kn@@ itting El@@ t@@ ester , average , New Year : these put the date on the one &apos;s oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first enter an album in &amp; digi@@ pack ; it will be the first image in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected to help you to record the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select a different photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button , and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album preview , you can choose the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be n@@ ested .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have another effect . on the collection includes always all photos of the album . of course you can use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window introduces you to the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed on this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of these curtains with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can create extras all the thumb@@ nails .
information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . which information is , you can edit via settings ; set up here the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails .
the thumb@@ nails will have help of help . if you want to rest the mouse cursor a moment across an image . the help displays the most important characteristics including all tags of a photo . the scre@@ enshot is shown above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a Help window .
photos are all what it &apos;s about &amp; digi@@ tization ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your photos as it suits you . you can view all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ tization ; possible , through the context menu of the preview , or the menu picture in the menu bar . you can choose between the image of the pictures , a slideshow or editing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by entering into either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . using the image processing you can view your photos and edit them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ tization ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button . the application listed there will be controlled by the &amp; KDE ; file regulations for the data type , you will find information in the &amp; KDE ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image processing programs can come to problems with the picture contained in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . by doing so , this information is lost out of the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; digi@@ tization : two options available for rotation . the easiest option is to click the Pre@@ view and Fol@@ der . in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep enlargement ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you get a photo from &amp; digi@@ pack ; er@@ ase , it will be moved into the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; f@@ 8 image deletion or dischar@@ f if you prefer really del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ f using Shift .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ des@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ tised ; used to either be the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photographs of this month will be shown in the screen view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the file view , so that only the photos of the selected days are shown .
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and be cat@@ alo@@ ise . keywords are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword was assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search again .
if a keyword is selected , all photos , which were marked with this keyword , are displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . thus , you can also organize parts of the Tree &amp; quot ; My keyword se@@ per@@ ately , so that you can find the keywords that you are looking for , easily find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted cat@@ ar@@ word in the IP@@ TC data areas of the picture , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the keywords in the loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ tization ; the images noticed .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keywords are quot ; or click on an existing keywords , after you have clicked on an existing keyword , then this is the sole word for this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself is not deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by pressing it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu that gives you the possibility to push the keyword . a keyword can be at a time just once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a sample by clicking on the right button of the mouse in the context menu . you can edit the name of the keywords , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords are entitled ; change .
to select a different photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality provided with keywords , you first have chosen to record your photos in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords will be granted ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu .
you can insert a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to the designated keywords . in this way you can see a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword , in which you can open the context menu of the photo , and select from the tags menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline opinion indicates a time @-@ dependent h@@ ist@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this ho@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the time@@ frame which gives the time unit . thus , all the corresponding pictures are shown in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then it will be shown on the list below .
encomp@@ ass all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , records , records and in the future even more .
Neb@@ el@@ er Search box is a small lamp that will find the green if the search results will be found . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this , you can store a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here as a live search , always fil@@ tered what you &apos;ve entered as search criteria . after you have been stored , the f@@ d filter has been stored in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search will be done . you will see my search list in the main window . if you want to change your choice after searching , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the My Search list and select an option in your context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search will be entered again with the search results . if you want to edit an extended search query , the dialog displays the extended search for your previous search . here you find more information about the Search for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the extended search provides an expanded search form with many search parameters available , with which you may search in specific fields of &amp; digi@@ come ; s database can search .
the list of searches is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . any option can be added or deleted by operators . each option can be added with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ ch ... . in addition , you can search the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; to create .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two pic@@ ks , the more they correspond to it . this technique is used in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar one . using a corpor@@ a , the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the unlimited search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open up and you can let it fall there .
sketch : free @-@ hand paint sketch : record a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ tization ; finds the matching images . also here , a swelling can be set .
this tab presents an intuitive dealer tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature order . you can press C@@ trl ; click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all the images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this is pres@@ upp@@ oses the your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . he works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ tised , is a lumin@@ tically available in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em lumin@@ tically added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ table and open its windows . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ tically quickly with L extras .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you want to sync your copy into what window area is . if you want to sync from the toolbar , and running zoo or black@@ operations on one of the images , then these pictures will also be compared with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to choose quickly from a picture series . if you use pair @-@ wise navigate from the toolbar . now use the left mouse button at any preview picture to see it in the left pane . this is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal bra@@ ins are also working directly from the luminous as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all pictures from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light @-@ table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ pe feature that you click on the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the image , you need to click them and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode Pre@@ view will then show both pictures in the same image area .
this zo@@ oming is just as in other views . just use the zoom regul@@ ator among the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and out into the picture . this happens in both pictures if you are previ@@ ew@@ ed in the mode .
what is a digital component management - away from the modem ? digital account@@ ancy considers every part of the process following after the image was made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos carries out a form of digital matter . most of us do this but not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how you can backup your pictures , protect , protect and edit photos again . we look at downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , assess , assess , optimize , wait , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Corporate Governance refers to , inde@@ xed , ass@@ esses , transforming , transforming , conf@@ us@@ cated and exported content to a mon@@ et@@ ory or cultural value .
metadata are defined as data about data . metadata are available in accordance with your definition data , which will provide information on or documentation of other data that may be managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos do you have , then you don &apos;t even use it &amp; digi@@ tization ; . the approach will save the metadata in a database as well as in image files , very quick search and secure archiving for you to access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you need anything in your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos may have to store if you want to save it to a reserved drive or at a network drives &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location . if you were in a year several times at the same place . the remaining photos will organise using your data . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant immigration of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years you will have 95 % archives and 5 % working files and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking tables easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a desc@@ ended image .
we also recommend the option to store metadata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget it , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens when you want to change ? to adjust &amp; digi@@ tization ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now need any photo keywords , sign@@ ages and an evaluation . of course , you can select all images , which will need the same attribute and then hit the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let us now proceed with keywords , keywords as you are often called by other programs or category . all three are syn@@ onyms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ zed images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree will insert the right place for you . the sort of hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree on another . the changed keywords are tr@@ acked by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while it tracks the under@@ mines .
the graphic shows how different metadata changes . this is a very rough representation , since each block contains metadata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data features all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for storing your metadata .
you want most anyone to let your photos just see , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing is . WOW ! you start to dream of dre@@ aming , memories , the historical time span is present again , you might even hear the still@@ ness . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the image to create an interest . if you have pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key it is the importance to the observer to help Him through the mo@@ tive that you moves has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for himself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can save as much text , in an international alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE can even tell you a sp@@ ell@@ chec@@ ker . you will need to tell the story no second time after your wishes into the cap@@ itali@@ zation and / or title of the web gallery .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it the earth not a boring planet before Google Earth ? good , because with pictures the move of spatial presentation now already starts with light speed .
the possibilities of the Ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alisation take advantage of already innum@@ erable and will soon be able to open it . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can start your travel virtually . you can also export the photos at the entrance . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright to share restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for producer and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to use the identity of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organisation may be used . after that value , it should not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for publishers ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author @-@ field , this field must be filled out as well .
publishers ( syn@@ onymous for provider ) : use the provider area to identify who is the photo offers . this does not necessarily mean the author . if the photographer is listed here for a message agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a camp photo , then the group / agency will provide the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the solution for this problem are digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is especially important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros this protection is very important to this protection against it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image unique . &amp; digi@@ tization ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking data in the near future .
themes : record error , disk loss , rap@@ ids , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster , temperature , temperature , dissemin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we are not talking about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which cause a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated as cau@@ tious and one should not d@@ are to you longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course , there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; p@@ ie ; 2 this piece is one lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your Er@@ mess@@ enger room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can store good discs and good recording devices and they are not significantly more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it is about choosing the right to choose .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you are just first written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control environments . despite this massive protection they need through chemical aging , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for broken CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes wonders to CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and Linux ; but there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . read more .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the For@@ mat@@ te war against the HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost hex@@ agonal the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies for the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good lo@@ qui@@ ver on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . if you want to store the media with a description , date &amp; author . please do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides for this topic a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ mis@@ sal
in brief : dis@@ ks hold on the longest when you run in the Temper@@ ature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . with lower temper@@ ament , the fault rate dramatically increased . some of SMAR@@ T determined errors announce the immediate forthcoming failure . these are particularly les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and def@@ aults . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also backup data loss due to an electric case before you have secured the files but these losses normally can be produced without major problems .
while most electrical devices does not matter much , this can cause serious harm to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware switch , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from un@@ avoidable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity tops is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed some of the energy @-@ heat and the rest is ground@@ ed . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ box . keep in mind that not any plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the flash , and therefore protecting the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable connected to your computer , you should be sure that also all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . this also applies to phone pi@@ pelines and cable drivers as well . others offer connectivity options for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for traveling .
while an over@@ voltage protection of your system will protect your system from smaller variations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete loss . even an decay of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a underground @-@ free power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically supply battery power . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
raise the potential risk , which your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety in power mal@@ functions with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you think how well your computer will protect it . at the end , you should always remember all cables before going to the holidays .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared with the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the relatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . the professional variant will not be available to you in full resolution . the professional variant will not provide you with unlimited memory , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are processed automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and in large companies is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine . all transmis@@ sions are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs pose at least the data integrity of operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission errors occurred to you , not if this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered so that there should be no protection to your computer . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the inside your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as it produce inter@@ fer@@ encing within the data streams . with normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records in low levels and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it will be available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the Z@@ FS is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the Notebook and 46 % in desktop systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of the theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itineraries , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrup@@ ted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process in a sudden stop during operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ ately status will be avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , rob@@ ber@@ y and human mistakes are the main cause of data loss .
digital cameras from digital cameras are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and rou@@ gh@@ ness of all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sens@@ orial . even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and high quality optics , the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do you make no other loss for data loss . so do you save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , exchange of plates or size change of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a stro@@ kes you will get lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ bon@@ ding : fire , water , electricity , children and rob@@ ber@@ y are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the complete house .
so des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ es means getting a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is a further benefit of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for loss of loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference Protection : a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup . create a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the final difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . create multiple times . you can restore the original status at any time when such backup comes up . this backup comes from a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next to the exception that is only secluded and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security about s@@ sh .
back up important images after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come up for backup however with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . each additional th@@ inner should take place manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , original X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , Media , reg@@ res@@ sed images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , ... , use of the internet .
thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature you have to look at caution and rate anew while the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . however , you should ask yourself how the current system is compatible with you . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future to evaluate .
this question should actually be answered from the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is nowadays for anyone available . so if you have an old system that &apos;s important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check out your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the trade fair for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually always expanding .
let &apos;s take advantage of how you have built the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them off .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / sd@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / sd@@ b &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / sd@@ b , the new record is / dev / sd@@ b ; # works with ext@@ 2 , fatal 16 , 32 and travelling time ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of motion if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software there can be read , then you can create it . this task will become easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was developed as an open source standard the GIF should replace it . however , it is a lot more . it is losses free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG may have relative many administrative information but not as many as TIFF needed and has a slow compression . this format we would recommend to store your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF may store in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss of free compression ( de@@ fl@@ ates ) . a problem is however , that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a lic@@ t @-@ free and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides for now and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon can also use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in order to replace the &amp; quot ; Bild@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; -@@ Technology of the 1990s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a identi@@ fier technology that allows users to insert their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer it from an original of your recording , mostly in the blank format , to archive . X@@ MP fits , as it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , if you notice the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata communities and the D@@ C@@ MI communities , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , standard conferences and workshops , standard connections and informative efforts to achieve a broader acceptance of metadata and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera system , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ er processing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off in some circumstances from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first into web@@ galleries , co@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ts@@ . in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description how you can add photos , which you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use it , connect them to the server , turn the camera on the scor@@ eboard and turn them into . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog displays files and images stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not provide all information .
the tab Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s registration , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from All . this loads the photos not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the chosen one with the default settings of your KDE labels . once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download the chosen item . the button selected will be selected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this is an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
when you use the buttons all download or out@@ chosen you will appear a dialog with which you can select the target album , shown in which the photos are sorted , displayed in section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after which you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ pack ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at one time by del@@ eting the button Del@@ ete . if you only wish to delete some , you have to select them first and delete them deleted .
please note that there are no possibility of photos deleted from the camera . so , the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; so you should carefully check if you want to completely delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete it from the camera , because this is much faster .
cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos deleted from the camera . this can be too double file names when you load photos of different pic@@ utes into the same album . therefore , it may be reasonable , the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and sp@@ itting the image and date @-@ based submission . if you use this latter option , you automatically create one folder per day .
the options during transmission opens three further options that are carried out before the pictures are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you choose this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you desire a different format format than the standard format , you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % S . switch the option date &amp; time to add . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command line .
if you use the option camera fil@@ ename , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or if you spell it , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ pack ; for a photo is used , shown below the name that the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download . not all cameras do this information . in the page header metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and when your camera does not provide this information , it leaves and digi@@ tised ; the photo is extended in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when your camera is provided information about the date on which the photo was made available , can create &amp; digi@@ tised ; this feature is based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . all cameras do not provide this information . in the page side@@ bar , you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option . use the button folder @-@ based sub@@ folders at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the kno@@ b . select then up@@ loading . the file sel@@ ector dialog and KDE ; appears in which you can select the files uploaded to the uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
after choosing the image is done , asks &amp; digi@@ pack ; she , where the images are loaded too . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to load the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that is stated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link up a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone used an aircraft to shop an area by automatic recording of GPS data to cart@@ o@@ graphs . environmental plann@@ er , military , police offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; user who wants to locate the location of the photo , or simply document this aspect , it is good for storing the position of a photo .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data areas , such as the data in these fields come ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , through a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recipients . either as a module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ ads A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or ps@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to store this information in g@@ p@@ x format because it is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the covered Co@@ ordin@@ ates that are created for example of map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European road types . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to give you much control over its work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to adjust the Settings menu . set up dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons to the left .
this action can be displayed on embedded preview , or start editing . you can set the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains as shown below , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ed identity and copyright @-@ related data . these data are automatically selected in the relevant IP@@ TC data fields . in a database synchron@@ isation this data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
car title is a syn@@ onym for ren@@ ditions : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . this can be as a photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description on the author , this field has to be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the state of the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is for a message agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be en@@ umer@@ ated the picture here .
the IP@@ TC promotions store the data into the respective IP@@ TC rim . it is achieved that the metadata are permanently included in the image and cannot be imported in the database itself ; it contains other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ tization ; will be imported without getting lost .
pic@@ ks of pic@@ ks ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments , which you can add to your photos , using the pictures included in the pictures . caution : with pictures , which have already been sign@@ alled , these are translated by &amp; digi@@ tization ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is in the main window via a file . depending on the chosen option this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; display , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove . any file in a &amp; digi@@ pack ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which does not have any of these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tization ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button up@@ loading right of each category .
the setting of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tization ; can then be opened on this page to the default values . however , if you then enter the lumin@@ aire , these settings are turned on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better rout@@ ing results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown pictures . if you prefer a different color , you can choose them here . you can switch the toolbar without editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors will be specified here . in the picture process , this picture can be integrated with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and can be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia on the near@@ er explanation .
with setting PNG @-@ compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of PNG @-@ files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , as PNG is using a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a quick calculator , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ates -@@ compres@@ s@@ bag m for TIFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm makes losses free .
with the hi@@ ring of losses @-@ free JPEG files you can save losses free . even if you choose the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata were not yet supported , but still in the planning stage .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the picture editing was just a picture @-@ picture for photos . currently , it is quickly developed into a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default gain is that all green pixels are the same . if the ad@@ line green pixels of the CCD @-@ sensor in the output . if you use this option , this problem creates a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ ell@@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white balance is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the whit@@ eboard is not placed . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported by Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is it the lar@@ der , so the parts of your images are mounted on , because of the in@@ capacity of your camera to capture the smo@@ k@@ lich@@ ter in the settings . the setting colors will generate some fancy results , as it displays the spi@@ ke in various ro@@ ars . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast pu@@ zz@@ ling such as green and red . &amp; digi@@ gal , therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red spots from the remaining blue pixels of the remaining blue pixels . of course this is a matter of how much colour or white you want .
when you select option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ worth according to your taste . however , you probably have to set it a bit higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ tization ; - to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should be conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor that provides a large picture of the colour fil@@ tered pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; Wh@@ ites came ; and D@@ cra@@ v put you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ DC . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you will be carried out during the raw converting .
a profile is translated to color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ pack ; information like the color information of a bull room to translate into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in picture editing / colour administration module with raw files .
color profile folder can be stored in the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised ; this folder will be studied during the Star@@ ts .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ad ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file .
the shade view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored , not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the cam@@ er@@ p@@ er and model you are using . not all profiles are created on the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain dy@@ es or gam@@ ma @-@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ v gam@@ ma is not available for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depths . this means that you need to carry the col@@ on sound@@ ed yourself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ profile with which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can use image , since your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated instead of leaving on the fl@@ ashing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for which . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is obviously in@@ officially :
the Canon kernel extension makes the style designed for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscape , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; KDE ; picture distor@@ tions and image processing ; many modules support that were written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and then these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals for the K@@ IP@@ I module .
the Settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator switches the time between the outputs , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other an@@ gled fields turn off the metadata one or , which ends at the bottom of the images while viewing appears .
the camera features are shown on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right above there is a button Automatic diagnosis , which is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected correctly , turned on and in picture below mode . below are the port settings . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage cameras from the camera shop . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / ring , which you can attach your camera to .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ pack ; to use , you must connect the camera to your computer , turn it into the scor@@ eboard and turn it on .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set up cam@@ er@@ amo@@ del and Port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any label for your camera . this will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option pol@@ ating dialog for pushing &gt; pictures into the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the talk of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when choosing a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly controlled by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option changes in the right side of the side@@ bar , you will need to apply changes to the button changes .
you can also include the display of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ tization ; at the starting point , this can be accelerated by the start @-@ process of &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
when looking for new or deleted albums / digi@@ tization ; the basic folders for new or deleted albums / photos came to search . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ tization ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , queries &amp; digi@@ tization ; you , whether it should remove it from the base .
different shades are available in &amp; digi@@ pack ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings allow you to select under settings design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs are listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ come ; create more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; Control came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the entry menu preview and selection of the entry display / edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . further information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in paragraph editing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current fil@@ ename , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top of the top and including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you use file save or the button save from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should put a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save time with file Save .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restore the editing menu or restore the button &apos; button to restore the image processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save .
nearly every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by choosing updating or restored by choosing updating from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for return and C@@ trl ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; about the return service or re @-@ button in the toolbar button a moment longer press , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also und@@ one or recovered .
once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture , or the entries in the menu file . if you have any changes in the Edit menu , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the An@@ si@@ le menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window display . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print out the actual picture , you can print on the menu text and get the default &amp; KDE ; print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print out individual images or whole sets . whole picture @-@ pages can choose from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the Album Album Ex@@ porting Printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same page header is available , even in the picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five hor@@ semen is clicked on :
multiple Click on the same tab may appear the side bar or disappear back to the edge .
in the text @-@ view you can insert text files with unlimited size or insert . follow the remark below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the signs are copied into EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ IP fields so that you may be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are de@@ formed after 2000 characters and special characters are being formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC installation field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions .
after you have commented on either the button or simply switch to the next picture , the sign@@ posts are then saved .
besides the use @-@ button there is one button More . with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this will always be done if you have selected a metadata attitude , which is always written in the pictures .
the evaluation section shows a measurement scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ dation . it can be used either with single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . the review from the side@@ bar is always used only to a picture at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding follows the diagram in the table below :
the keywords view a search box for the fil@@ ament of the keywords , the keywords and a com@@ box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ pack ; session of the keywords .
the keyword @-@ tree is adjusted dynamically to the keyword . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have lots of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series . if you entered different keywords , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the respective application fields in the tree . all keywords in a picture are saved into the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword @-@ tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , If you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter .
the page header information is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and view@@ points . if in addition one or more keyword filter from the right is used , only the inter@@ sections of these two is displayed . all presented keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view , to draw you with keywords , if the keywords already exist , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . then , a dialogue will be asked if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keywords will be displayed on no keywords , what the quantity on three pictures were reduced . they were drawn with C@@ trl + a , and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keywords to be removed and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes will take place at any start of the program . it can also be switched between different settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be or be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searching for . this can be an album , name , keywords , image , keyword , etc. .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can e.g. choose a extended search across all the items in the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the tick field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . then you see the options as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have primarily adapted it to &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one &apos;s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a Color@@ ful workflow using the colors that actually photograph or sc@@ anned colors . with a colored workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner , you can print or publish the colors that you choose from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to paint management , everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about color management work@@ flows . in addition , you will provide you with more information about color management . in addition , you will enable links with deep information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result .
if your image is met all six criteria listed below , you must not take care of the administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB color scheme . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image records are by email or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and make life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about Col@@ ling@@ ering ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can actually see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see , the hu@@ fi@@ ery region , and the colours in the s@@ R@@ GB color tree , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and then click Info About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to kiss my monitor , if I decided to work only in the R@@ GB Color ?
yes ! whether you work in the R@@ GB color tree or not , you need to finish your monitor k@@ alli@@ ons , since s@@ R@@ GB runs it . if you work as in the colour scheme of s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before using a further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alise , removable , automatic scanning and contrast from the menu navigation automatic correction will automatically try to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ ance value over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the ligh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magic correction for images that can be washed or washed out .
ev@@ enly : this method adju@@ sts the ligh@@ test editor of the colours of the selected picture , so that the ho@@ o@@ gram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the same very good results achieved in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue canal . it determines the dark and bright border @-@ tones and aligned the red , green and blue channels to complete ho@@ ist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and ligh@@ tness of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a rev@@ ital@@ ist of all values in between . this is only visible when watching images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ comparison of &amp; digi@@ pack ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the whi@@ m@@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ comparison correction is slightly limited since over a color @-@ room with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you are too far from the original picture , you can perform the white comparison in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ equation that is protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m . you start using the menu @-@ made colors white ab@@ stain@@ ed of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left are both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is adjusted dynamically the setting of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ pped image , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo features a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the h@@ ist@@ gram .
on the top right , a ho@@ ist@@ gram is shown that dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this ho@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shade adjustable you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also get bored .
stopping at the above controls , you should use the color @-@ temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture shows that automatically use selected color for the calculation of the white water temperature . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally you can set the white comparison with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator indicates the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is over@@ exposed . this is displayed as a combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of the whit@@ eboard you have set , you can hereby save in a text file and later load it again .
the button pres@@ ets puts all filtration values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . keep in mind that neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the enco@@ ders per colour channel of the be@@ ated image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding is also needed more disk space , comp@@ ac@@ tation time and stands for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG available .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the modification and the allocation of color profiles . colour bar can be carried out through the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of color @-@ management .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound@@ proo@@ fing . this tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to make use of these for multiple photographs . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same errors and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for the error correction you will find more information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tools Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ek@@ ed provides you with four color effects , a photovoltaic effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ or filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of was created when you completed a partial pressure a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture completes it . the result was a partial neg@@ atively tri@@ pod of the picture . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar energy . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately generates a negative image that so does not produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar installation image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilli@@ antly and gl@@ itter . try it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light converted colour which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a combination of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ath ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet offers him a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some photographers , especially those who wear hardly any landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contrast @-@ edges . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ e. in big pictures the filter can rel@@ ieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the colour contra@@ sting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting entries can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light rati@@ os , you can get the converted problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce it . any changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ance / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is based on the improvement of the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graphs of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graphs are three sliding into the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left @-@ hand side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the image changes .
on the right you can view the original and preview of the picture . the preview is dynamically based on the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box may be set whether the ho@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ me@@ y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear representation of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the linear H@@ ist@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the logical H@@ ist@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic di@@ sposition is useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often gam@@ ma @-@ values called .
the three colors pin@@ p@@ all@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values enable the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the output values as well as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background while being seen something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this kno@@ b the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture .
save as and load : with these buttons , the data set in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded again later . it will use the Gimp level format .
if you use this mode and the three color cass@@ ettes , the input values will automatically be adjusted to all the shadows , resources and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hi@@ sto@@ gram for red , green , blue , and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ als .
the option over@@ exposure indicator , controlled all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically based on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be indicated by the module :
beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ me@@ tic view . for pictures included with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most sensu@@ ous mode generates linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help continue .
if you move e.g. a curve to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with dar@@ ker output can be Cor@@ respon@@ sive and that the associated pixel are dar@@ ker .
preview the original photos is a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is displayed which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . each curve that you created can thus be saved in the fil@@ esystem and can be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp spa @-@ format .
if you create this method and the three shades of color , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ exposed indicators of view all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel exposed to be over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you will see the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white picture , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sun @-@ tones was set with the paint pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the shades of the photo .
the channel @-@ mix@@ er is another sophisticated tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel @-@ mix@@ er of the image processing .
with the channel optional box you can select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line in H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram appears to indicate the corresponding colour options .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture mix@@ er then activate the option Mon@@ och@@ rom as the channel @-@ bl@@ ender then is THE GRE@@ AT tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color comes to a visible ru@@ stling that appears from the color canal . color gre@@ ats consists of small no@@ zzles which does not appear at the same point in the paint channel and whose smoking pattern looks different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rom conversion in which you can reduce the far@@ thing first .
the storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitrary mix@@ er adjustment you can save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel bl@@ ender format .
the option over@@ exposure indicator , controlled all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which blue channel is re @-@ aligned . the L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance option is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstr@@ action skills . with the development of digital photography is black / white a work@@ piece , as colours can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scen@@ eries and fits perfectly well to portrait against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) gre@@ ase .
Oran@@ fil@@ tered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air @-@ photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
rotation : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates indicator @-@ effective and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ est during the day time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and middle notes while he adds a bit of cold in the shadows . this is very similar to the process of hiding one pressure and re @-@ development in a Sep@@ ul@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop @-@ portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall . the menu @-@ script picture texture applying the picture processing can be used for this .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper textiles effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to put his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ amed eye . below picture can add the module from the picture processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired t@@ acks for your picture . through , the image corresponds to a thin line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce embr@@ aces it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , en@@ cl@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative frame adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : displays the width of the frame in percent . the value area for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the frame created target picture will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing of images , especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can simply insert a reform@@ atted text into an image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color room and the character set with its properties as you need it . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sigh@@ ted background . the picture is finished .
any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &apos; OK &apos; . after the picture once saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool can be applied to a template using a template .
the menu image editing can be used in the picture processing can be used to diver@@ t templates over an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to the size of the file size of the template , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; mailing list controls digi@@ pack @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you must put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates has been rest@@ art@@ ed a tree @-@ view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ ord@@ Pad . the selection of a folder is updated the preview of the templates .
under the Pre@@ view there are three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
Re@@ duction : this button res@@ ized the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must kno@@ b the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the picture is then adapted to automatic size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; three different tools are available at the field of shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but creates especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
un@@ bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharp@@ ly . in fact it doesn &apos;t work bit psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eres Dun@@ st and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the ac@@ ut@@ eness . elements which are smaller than the resolution must therefore be summar@@ ized in a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if colored points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more detri@@ mental as normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG @-@ images , a camera has often been applied to internal ac@@ ut@@ eness . images in the pipe @-@ format on the other hand must always be weak@@ ened during the processing .
some scanner will occur during the reading of the image already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by raising a photo with the field of field of field . this allows you to proceed with the menu entries in the field of basket .
you should however deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the edge of the edges but rein@@ forces the noise . in general the most usable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing of an image is the tool re@@ focus . under Re@@ ward you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to the edge .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark soft character with the menu entries and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog displays the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can see here .
the original image and the preview help the picture to process . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and amount . the default values produce good results and should be proven first . an increase in radius or viewing will increase the effect . if you get the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask to be strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are produced near sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels on each side of a gun affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red picture added to the original one by the original one . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference amount . one can thus define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter . in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and hence beauty mal@@ functions in faces , ty@@ ards and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused on an image through improvement of the ac@@ ut@@ eness . it used the copyrighted cor@@ ridors of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to raise an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which there is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it also uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ming . re@@ focus most frequently achieved better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by entering the colors real@@ ising in the picture editing .
in practice the circular folding is far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long dick , which is causing the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far away from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels . the causes und@@ es@@ irable results .
circular edge : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the main parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the standard value should result in good results . you can bet a higher value if your image should become very bl@@ ur , but then on Heiligen@@ stadt .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help eliminate arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
smoking filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the smoking filter is too low , a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will continue to consume the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche ac@@ ut@@ eness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche field . it is most frequently caused by a previously led bl@@ ur@@ red filter . in most cases , you should be able to avoid this value to 0 in order to avoid color@@ full arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you might need to also increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ y filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ ith : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ers . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular field or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen field . in most cases , you should select great value for that parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 .
the storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitrary real@@ ising parameters you have set is thus stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to carry out all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions in the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture in otherwise . the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible , which however later leave uncomfortable arti@@ facts .
if you have pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red masks produced better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be causing this bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as ac@@ ut@@ eness .
theoretically , it must be bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king increasingly arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ red filter . it is practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture that needs to be corrected . this picture was made using an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the edge correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison to English under this address .
the regul@@ ator gl@@ utt@@ les pres@@ ets the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark , in order to produce a gre@@ ase P@@ up@@ ille .
the paint tin@@ te allows a adapted colour for the P@@ up@@ ille . in case you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool of inf@@ alli@@ um correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the author algorithm was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starter points to simplify restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filtering settings , you can use the rider smo@@ o@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed consider p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smo@@ o@@ thing about the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no tigh@@ tening is necessary afterwards . please note that the detailed attitude always should be subordin@@ ated .
passing dependence : Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ularity , or the CCD ru@@ ffles will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum satur@@ ation factor above all@@ es. then defines the relative smo@@ o@@ thing . place this value therefore appropriate to the degree of smoking in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smooth@@ ed , because it &apos;s difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : can be passed on as often the algorithm . usually here is 1 or 2 out of .
angular gradual da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should also be small . take care of that small angles create a long running time . therefore , you should choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step@@ per span &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value of smaller 1 in order to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses , and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor . but he doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of image errors can thus be retri@@ eved in a text file and later re@@ charged .
the errors corrected is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ b off .
below you can see how picture errors can be removed with Small arti@@ facts . the module is made in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool presents sel@@ ectable machine filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair at the lens . it can also be used to remove sensory cable from the camera or the modem ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on the sensory cable of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial on this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the lower advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius is controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter is per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image . the area indicated by the radius r@@ ally on the image and the color in it becomes smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ t to determine the filter at the front . if it is lifted you will need to re@@ fine cra@@ p filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer obtain and smo@@ kes or lubric@@ ate enters again .
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for the edge . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed all of the noise or rou@@ gh@@ tips can occur . set it on a value close to maxim@@ ise if you want to remove a w@@ aking noise or JPEG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the gra@@ ding process of which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the gra@@ ding process of which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value may be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger , however , also the shadow ranges .
ste@@ aming : controls the adjusting the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive fil@@ tered radius is responding to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if he is lifted up , the edges can occur . if he is at his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ pi@@ ers may occur to the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this .
save under and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the reduction of saving you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected one with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft , fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to mark soft character with the menu entries and experiment with the smo@@ o@@ thing display on the right of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photographs by photographs .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts of your images . it is very well adapted to show rainbow &apos;s , gran@@ ular , compos@@ ites , and local errors that arise in digital , original or re@@ alizes digi@@ tised images . the smo@@ o@@ thing occurs along the picture cont@@ ours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text replacement is carried out with another tool , the image fails . the algorithm for restoration was developed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ dorf and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG facts can be reduced : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compres@@ sing p@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts . - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this attitude shall correct these problems .
the buttons save as and loading exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can thus be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore cancel the calculation using the button below .
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ formity no@@ ises . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ularity on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo recovery . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts created by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove hot@@ pixels of photos taken with a CCD camera ; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project that are copyrighted by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with an dark image sub@@ vert method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture review .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important that you will record the dark picture directly afterwards to discover new hot or bright pixel due to CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the fitting image to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark picture and this automatically loads the next session again .
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixel are taken up in all fores@@ ight areas .
choose an area to view the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . this is the filters available :
Dur@@ ing : it is an average of the nearby pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be turned to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ische surface ( 2 @-@ D@@ im ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ D@@ im ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ screen correction in a colour photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , see . the original picture was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , one of the image .
broader objective , especially those in the medium and large image format , can often not uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor sector . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting of the picture ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by following the light that can reach the sensor there .
but he also has cons . many centers filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . far @-@ angle objective should use the camera with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise in@@ significant effects caused by movement arise .
with the large popularity areas of today &apos;s filtration and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ence transformation in a blank filter , which is used without this filter . the tool of Vig@@ net@@ ting filter is applied to a picture . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light gravity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , leading an optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 2 , or random@@ ly an aper@@ ture of 2 , spl@@ itting the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lighting , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the edit an image with the Vig@@ net@@ tle @-@ correction reduces the lumin@@ ance of the pixels . you need to re@@ fine the target image with these options . the regul@@ ators will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re@@ fine @-@ tuning of the target image , let the values for ligh@@ tening / contrast / gam@@ ma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; picture machining from the menu colour gra@@ dation .
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) displays the corrected image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ance and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ment ; liner distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient covers the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar loop effect , but fla@@ p to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to the opposite of the second gradient . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion virtually eliminated .
generally : this value controls the thickness of the distor@@ tion of second degree . with negative values , they can be corrected to have tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions and positive values of cul@@ tiv@@ ating distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the degree . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; no@@ vels of parameters has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value will scale the size of the image and thus leads to a correction of the first gra@@ ding of . negative values enlarge as well as positive the image reduction .
brigh@@ tening : this value suspended the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the correction of the correction . the values you use for your picture are stored and used at the next start as default values .
the correction or ci@@ li@@ ous correction should be performed prior to all cl@@ utter or size changes . best perform this correction than all the first by . if you perform a picture anew and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect obvious of fal@@ sche .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture , and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the counter / c@@ il@@ ous distor@@ tion with the help of lines .
when you correct a cal@@ li@@ ous distor@@ tion , the resulting image has black corners . you can transform it using the as@@ mmer tool in the menu or remove the zoom controller of this dialog .
for most pictures , the spher@@ ical correction is derived from . the next logical step for some motives as for example shots from the front , frame and paintings is to have the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of tons @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible from this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the thumb@@ nail you can set two parameters to sim@@ ulate film gran@@ ularity and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to sim@@ ulate film gran@@ ularity . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows become white as snow !
since the filter cartridge channels for re@@ producing infrared film is mixing , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , as the color @-@ information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ th applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the original image has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the smo@@ ker .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter film gran@@ ularity is an easy to use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ularity , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the makers large silver gra@@ ins of the photo em@@ ulsion .
the film @-@ bas@@ ing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street cinem@@ atic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your Mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic photos , you must use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the gra@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed to apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of film gra@@ zing effects on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and working ( 2 ) . the original film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it used to use a protected protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ pack , filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature paintings and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the top sel@@ ects the pin@@ sel@@ size between one and five out . thicker brushes are suitable for great pictures . smooth controls the smo@@ o@@ thing or , from the other side looks , the peculi@@ arity .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the modified version is marked with the ( 2 ) p@@ allet size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and gl@@ oss 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter consistency of coal and intensity for generating a coal spices . the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed . pictures their gradient are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sc@@ iz@@ ers for you . this would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value area from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower aligned the contrast ( gl@@ oss ) .
this is an example of the consistency filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved upon adjustment of the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ tization comes : filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it used a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization is a fast tool to give your images again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engra@@ ving filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in the cells and let it look like it is seen through glass bu@@ cks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture distor@@ ts here with a different version of glass @-@ blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button &apos; button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of acu@@ ity effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom immunity : wi@@ pes the picture along st@@ alled lines that go from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharp@@ ness a zo@@ omed camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al imbalance : wi@@ pes the image by rotation of pixels by a center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : wi@@ pes the image to generate the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
motion sequence : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : out of a car or train photographed , camera .
soft@@ ens bl@@ ity bl@@ ity : wi@@ pes the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dream@@ y and gl@@ oss soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to adding a warm and subtle light .
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ev@@ fe : wi@@ pes the image due to random shift in pixels and thus sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of one of the random camera .
intelligent infin@@ ity : find the colour in the picture and wi@@ pes these without the rest to change .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button &apos; button at any time .
the rain drops are a nice little tool to make recur@@ ring on your picture . thus , it gives natural your images a n@@ ud@@ inal appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
dro@@ pping size allows to change the size of the dri@@ p . since the dro@@ pping size is not growing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ pack ; image processing a area freely of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , for example a face , which is to be free to stay . if you start the filter cage , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of a rainy Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can use it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . you can transform your tools in the menu transforming or transform mir@@ rors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo for a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to minor is simple . the big question is , how can you get a picture infl@@ ated and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ating .
many picture editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio is retained by entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smooth@@ ed , because it &apos;s difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as much as loading are used exactly to it . each entry for photo can be downloaded as a text file and loaded later again .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load after getting off . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button &apos; button .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ atable , by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the default ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magnific@@ ation to the comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . the image processing allows you to simply cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle . you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . by doing so , you can change the size of the slide area by pressing the corners of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . you can create a new rectangle by simply clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the random section , use the button &apos; button &apos; button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file save or file saved under the menu file to store the newly coded photo .
in the thumb@@ nail , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you defined in dialogue remains intact .
in the field of aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of height and the width is assigned to the width .
the tool Up aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to filter the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
bottom in dialog you can set the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool comm@@ itting its settings depends on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the default tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the image and not the original image .
the settings of inter@@ connection help allow help to bl@@ ending your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divi@@ ding are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ party gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the di@@ agon@@ als .
Golden centre : the golden middle is a split into different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of Nau@@ til@@ us shells or the bl@@ acks of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all sorts of things we feel as nicely .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational figure 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used the ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number according to 1 equal the sum of their two preceding numbers is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition usually follows as visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides fluid auxiliary lines if you put an image together . these help are en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos to achieve closer . compared to third @-@ party gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow .
another rule is called the rectan@@ gles of golden spiral , also called Golden rectan@@ gles . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be just there without being able to fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also lead from the above discussed golden spiral . your ver@@ tices are the middle points of the pages of golden rectan@@ gles . notice that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , Golden Tri@@ angles are not in@@ different tri@@ angles . di@@ agonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynam@@ ical appeared .
when you use golden tri@@ angles in order to break your frame create a effect of professional photographers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your picture @-@ focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve .
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and bran@@ ce can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sections .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are shot by a angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle of rotation .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der corner . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown to the right above .
for your help , the module is available with a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines . after you move it via an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair is it to transform the function to use the function to use .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Autom@@ atically cutting function . choose one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sli@@ pped the picture a bit after the rotation . keep in mind but the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tively transformations are performed by a fixed point of the reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left corner : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after the adaptation of the perspective , the image will be a little lubric@@ ated . for an individual adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments make a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after being adapted to the perspective you will receive un@@ fun tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is the image with transform@@ ative su@@ ing from the picture machining .
the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal resolution , e.g. , the picture becomes distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a Parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can transform this module into a Parall@@ elo@@ gram .
drag your image by clicking the horizontal angles and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press on preference , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview .
for your help a vertical and horizontal line appears . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the shot , the picture becomes a bit wi@@ ped out . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neglected , but two switching produces twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and hence , you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the picture with transforming the cutting of the picture .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats and write . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; only files in formats you know . this happens according to the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ tised . in the configuration file you can find more information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sion@@ ers on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression dis@@ proportion . the 200@@ 0s version can also store loss when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read below Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English . you can convert pipe @-@ format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ come ; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ pack ; .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ v which is in &amp; digi@@ pack . all of the supported cameras will be shown below on the web page from Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of blan@@ ket formats used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but it is not a film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tization ; the &amp; KDE ; Settings can be used for playing films to play the program .

many tools you need the photo editing you need in &amp; digi@@ pack ; contain your description below .
all imaging tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft@@ ness , rou@@ gh@@ ing , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type before the filter is applied in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; consistency of users ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it permit five buttons to change the compar@@ ability of the fron@@ tal area . these modes are :
vertically divided without a duplic@@ ate . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected range .
horizont@@ ally share without a duplic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected range .
the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area displays the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the thumb@@ nail if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can take this box with the mouse within the picture and disc@@ ard it in the part of the picture from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all settings are marked by the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar features indicates the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are taken by EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab presents an intuitive dealer tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature order . you can press C@@ trl ; click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all the images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this is pres@@ upp@@ oses the your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; K@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ all@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; KDE , can either apply to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; KDE ; Settings and hot Custom color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the dialog box you can choose from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the colour next to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here the colour name can be changed .
it can also be used to select such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to the cursor . then move the mouse in ge@@ pressing left mouse button .
if the tick@@ eting box is inserted in the cursor under the button color , the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode will be over@@ write . this mode can be set by selecting the tick@@ ing box under the cursor below the cursor .
a selection that has been created just as described in the last section , can copy , cut and paste together with the actions .
&amp; K@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a sequ@@ ent sign , in case a further color follows . if there are three number values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ color@@ edit .
the colours in the palette and the output range can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; Pro@@ graph@@ ite ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise graph@@ ers ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; D viewer ; project has set itself the aim of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all features of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program to replace .
&amp; Pro@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . &amp; c@@ app@@ viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the Grap@@ h in &amp; K@@ ate ; represents the graphs and represents in &amp; we@@ tic viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; opening or Grap@@ h in &amp; K@@ app@@ viewer ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; to open the component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ ers pres@@ upp@@ oses . required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own window . initially , if you start &amp; quot ; without an argument , the main window contains only the symbol file and the ( blank ) list allow@@ able files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the picture scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is shown when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the Dia canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Old ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum grinding of a graphs .
when the file has just changed in a copy viewer , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h wants to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; your decision can also remember , so that later it will be possible . you should set up your decision later , you can set up the menu item settings ; see also , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; c@@ app@@ let ; instance , at the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; a graphic viewer , or want to display the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the layout of the layout .
with the program launch , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be entered , on this page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graphs .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font
the page News loading page gives the option to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on the hard disk , and by another program . you can define a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the modifications ) or the program each time .
the site opens the option to specify the behavior of &amp; G@@ graph@@ ite ; if a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already current session ) , or determine that each time is asked .
the page sitting management page gives the possibility to specify the start @-@ behavior of &amp; Pro@@ graph@@ ite . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or do not ) , or decide at every start to be asked .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layouts : the entries as they are described on the Website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for specific graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered panels of aligned graphs . the algorithm sets the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorithm is the standard for ung@@ ed graph@@ ers . it produces representations according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . here , the cam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorithm creates a jumping spr@@ ing@@ model for the spr@@ ite model . it uses the fru@@ ity @-@ cleaner sh@@ utter , and contains a multi @-@ step sol@@ vers for the treatment of large and cluster graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; -@@ algorithm introduces the k@@ not to according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadows , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which can then be executed by a shell . the command should change the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the Grap@@ h after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can change &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ algorithms special options allow , or even the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ eri@@ zed ) and uses the default algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for specific , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for infl@@ ated graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed , if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the icon is the toolbar pointer . click with this mouse pointer to a &amp; GUI , element to get more help to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the basic folder of the source repository .
&amp; Pro@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ program , which uses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tools for display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; quot ; in the Settings menu you will find further options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the grid line , in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog displays , in which you can choose whether the symbol of a template is to be created , or if you want to start anew .
represents the last one @-@ made step back again . if you have no step back@@ end , this function is disabled .
adds the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol of KDE .
do not change the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the point you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , they show you the X@@ - und y Co@@ ordin@@ ates of the current Pix@@ els , the size of the current character set , the enlar@@ ging factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

select transparent pixel or display lin@@ e@@ ale display and display dr@@ astic : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparency indicator . you can also specify the size : the car@@ os on Klein , means and Large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images include tools available to invite new pictures and storing them .
this module can be used to read new images from external sources and storing . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner that supported by SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video streams . so this will have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you scan the menu item , a dialog displays that you can choose between all the available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the pre@@ determined standard duc@@ t to select your image accordingly . check the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the valued file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
note that the window will be displayed completely , since some settings otherwise possibly can not be displayed .
after you hit the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan has been completed and the window will specify the options of the image file . here , you can insert the compression and type of image file . you &apos;ll also have to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved .
you can create screenshots after you in the menu of impor@@ ter - &gt; Screen photo ... a window appears in which you can adjust the different Screen Sa@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own programming window is selected , the desired program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be able to read other screens and windows . if you have chosen the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other desktop , you should choose this delay enough to have the time to navigate .
after the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog options will appear with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module also has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module is archi@@ ved your albums on CD / DVD media using the K@@ 3@@ b burning tool . you can simply select the file archi@@ ved albums . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also , the option Auto@@ Play is available for Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules extend the program in which you will be loaded to add additional features . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cut and further skills into the program . you can install as many modules as you wish .

Flickr is an online shop management on the internet . with Flickr it is possible to show off his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world to show the photos of your camera shop online and show your photos secure and private to your friends and family all over the world .
the module export folder to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a Tok@@ ens . it is thus virtually your passport to Flickr . a browser is started to log in on Flickr .
after the successful registration , the module may send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented at the following page after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed out on Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module is started exporting to Flickr for two thousand times , you will be greeted with the following dialogue , which indicates the current per@@ missions which indicates the current per@@ missions . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you wish to proceed with this permission .
the button photo should add once , once you set all the other options . with this kno@@ b you can select the photos which you want to upload . if you click on the O@@ k button the upload the photos to the Flickr server .
the keywords field can be filled with one by comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the image as a tags during the up@@ loading .
with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a private property .
if you choose the option to modify the size of the photos before the upload , the photos are updated before high load in size . the size is taken from the maximum value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is constantly changing the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates into the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available to images geo@@ graphically in spher@@ ical coordinate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo when used . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are being used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in the g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ .@@ g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphical localization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the top to visual dialog then appears . to load a possible cor@@ relation over time and localization , you need to load a file file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the same time recorded at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation that displays the coordinates in red . GPS rout@@ ing dates are recorded in GMT . this can be done with the time zone . here , you can use your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera limits . the devi@@ ation below are summar@@ ised . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality you have a local difference in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then push the button cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same site . since the dialog displays the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map and enlarge . choose this in the region and enlarge it . the level must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite images and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang on the GPS data on the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums at an image gallery from HTML pages to Version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that will be exported as HTML pages and set the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ded with the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be customized . the tab selection permits all the albums to be exported to HTML . you just need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ ign and the text will appear on the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s image defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image is created a page created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default option , or eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data is stored in the new pictures also in the new pictures .
with other color @-@ depth you can change the standard color @-@ depth . the also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able itself .
the rider &apos;s rider allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery to customize .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press v@@ om@@ iting to break the process .
when the module created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore check the program@@ ing points to determine whether an error occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically exp@@ ire to preview the gallery . press Close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image module is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image calcul@@ ator allows you to view a selection of images and run on them basic operations such as scrip@@ tions , zo@@ oming or p@@ anning . the viewer can be used with shor@@ ts and mouse clicks . it has been developed for a quick visual display and quick access to its functions .
after starting a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be modified in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows to save images in the JPEG format below , without the usual losses due to quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ sy @-@ free storage is to increase the file size , since there is no compression of color information . this can be found for example also in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ Client does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata mod@@ ul@@ s you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the file sel@@ ector to copy the image to which you want to copy the image . the data will be copied after you hit the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but do not write in every target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , using a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a base screen . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV der Di@@ ash@@ au .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . with this module , you can create a background color for the slideshow . using this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first choose the images packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module of extras .
the images selected by you are then en@@ umer@@ ated among image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting the images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and probably choose the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which will indicate a picture . the speed of the picture is defined below . a low value creates a sudden , high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file can be set at the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the ends .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the movie . after you adjust all settings to your preferences , you can start with the button co@@ ding the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now take a coffee or enjoy a cup of coffee whenever you &apos;re back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ver or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck pack@@ ets on the right bottom .
the printer driver allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper together in standard photographs . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ v by Dave Coff@@ in . an original itat of Him is : expect you from d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera producer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ v better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and run the module . the re@@ w image converter will appear then in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ fine the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be adjusted for the white @-@ comparison . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be aligned . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch works no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sy @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are going to frequently edit your pictures or use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format before it &apos;s just a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it .
the way of st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the opportunity to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar appears as far the conversion progress has been progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Start@@ ing and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album to be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize the image smaller or enlarge . these are provided four types of image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed on this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure before . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the indicated images before . additional pictures can draw on the list of images to be drawn and stored there .
after which you started the module , the pictures of the window will be displayed using the pictures selected from you . using the button images you can add additional pictures with a file sel@@ ector . for the last selected picture will preview a preview on the right .
you can also drag images on the image list and drop it there to add the list of images to sen@@ ing images .
the button will remove pictures from the list of images to be removed from the list .
once you have selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your email with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the refu@@ ges here . the pictures selected by you are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many pictures at a time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the notification e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every time you use it to change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are attached to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files as e.g. TIFF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are added , then the original output data will be added to the sen@@ ing pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed the status messages , looking for errors , you can view it . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the kno@@ b button you can write this window .
after starting the mod@@ al Fort@@ ress Di@@ ash@@ au you will find a window with questions like you want your slideshow . you can choose between the chosen and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation provides very elegant pictures with OpenGL . you have to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the fil@@ ename of images can be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop . you can then manually break up with Es@@ cape .
the option pictures acci@@ dentally select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
while the images can be set between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 Mill@@ is@@ ek@@ unden meet 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are over a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly , choose a different effect in any transition between pictures .
during the Di@@ ash@@ au you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can keep the presentation and start again , to the previous and the next picture , and stop the slideshow .
on the left side of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date is currently fail@@ ing . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team among KDE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface .
this module sets out the currently selected picture , depending on the chosen option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse through this browser , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in individuals , locations and in the group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories , for which you entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course see the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each of them is described .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person just select the images on which both persons can be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images .
if you have selected any of the persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ - but for each person has its own preview picture , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined for . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images ) for your keywords ) .
you must choose to choose which image should be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you have to select the picture activation window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the case window , you can customize the picture factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut@@ ted .
if you access the entry list in the main window , a dialog will be displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for the celebration of the image characteristics . this dialog can be viewed on the picture yet again .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description of the images according to this text . if you want , you can also enter a date according to the date ; the date can either be part of the overall date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images on specific names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , are not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but prefer to try equal functions , you have the following alternatives to this guide :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the scre@@ enshot and the introductory videos .
start &amp; kick album ; and select the demo album in the first dialog , or select the photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu help menu @-@ free photo album ; finally , some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name already says , this bar displays you data records about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each body then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing threads only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can edit the displayed entries file view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date is displayed in the Pre@@ view pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so . if you select an area , you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; gives you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ - ; integrated version , which you can create from the menu item HTML ...
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the over@@ looked and a description which should contain HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ lag album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to see that information is displayed without description . note that the viewer can also be displayed without description . note that &amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular be@@ ware .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look . most of the settings are un@@ ambiguous , which is why not respond specially to this .
below you can set different resolutions for the images below . this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download it for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , search . if he wants to get an image larger then he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best choice for all of your HTML files , and select a new sub@@ folder for all of your html files .
first , you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can either select a folder or any of KDE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible for viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you , you need to manually copy them into it . so that the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders located .
the currently described options have all been related to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder .
if you &apos;re on a business party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ - ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . if you have , of course , you can create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you have , however , you can write an HTML page on the images , reception , etc . then you have to do with &amp; sound@@ ing album ; this work will not even happen once again .
with &amp; Co@@ w album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the imaging features are processed with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage all images can be stored in the file and that you can pass this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two simple way . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the respective pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for exporting images , which you can view through the menu File Ex@@ porting ... View profile .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when exec@@ uting the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; paste video ; the pictures automatically copy for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most images have been compressed to JPEG . as most of the images have been compressed to JPEG . it is normally not the files to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is the maximum picture size limit . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by specifying that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you import a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File menu , the export database is imported as described in the database .
the wizard on imports consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you wish to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alise the category persons of the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called in your database . therefore , in the third dialogue window , the categories which are imported to imported file and which categories these are in your database .
the fourth step allows you to import the categories of the file to import file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen in the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and view : if you look at pictures you often want to see within different picture groups and m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see some pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depic@@ ted .
in this guide you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced subjects and adap@@ t@@ ability .
K@@ photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your images . it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this guide , about pictures spoken , but often , it also includes videos featuring one .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup from a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S where they want .
&amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically it at future Star@@ ts ; if you want to start another database with pictures , you can start a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entries of the photo@@ album ; set up ... come to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ - ; in the following section of the user &apos;s guide you will be explained the different settings options .
on the left you can view six different symbols , with which you can access settings options and options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can call by a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
in it , you describe how to set different properties for each picture , for example people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you see the dialog box that is used to edit already existing groups . for each available group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options allow you to set up full members , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member state as explained in .
in view of the settings that are available to you for the celebration of the members , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means KDE ; Image plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; are , but are distributed separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules are tested with the demo database ; on this account you should try new modules first with the demo database . you can either call these on your own pictures without a copy album &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I can be very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; sound@@ ing album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules that can be ok on albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; sound@@ ing album .
here sim@@ ulates &amp; sound@@ ing album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment .
next to the current album has to be &amp; sound@@ ing album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums . so if you are using the category persons , it will be selected &amp; sound@@ ing album ; so do if you would have selected persons to view and share this with the module .
since some modules are compatible with &amp; k@@ foto@@ album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the section modules which modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with your own pictures start .
as you are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to any other KDE application , see the window below a menu bar and a toolbar . at the same time , it does not contain a lot of information as you do not have any information about your pictures . in the section , we &apos;ll come back to this window , but now click on the entry to show you an overview with all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . these include information on the persons appearing on the picture . you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per pic@@ tured and all images were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for seeking and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by placing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ - ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to push the images within the list : if you have for example a family business and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are illustrated , so that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and assigned .
if you prefer to have an alphabe@@ tical list displayed , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected any ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and include these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons that are shown below the thumb@@ nail on the right above .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window which indicates the US as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the catalogue of catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over @-@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you have just sorted your categories alphabe@@ tically . see you also .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the dialog , by forming the he@@ ap of the boxes , click and post@@ p@@ one the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a private window by moving it out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and here you will see a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
when you select the entry pictures in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images if you do not have a filter here . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button . try it simple .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set as the background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture display . if you have not opened any window with an image background , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image gallery . simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete and select either the Del@@ ete button or select from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also use images stored on the hard disk . of course , you have to save the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see in the database index ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present ; so you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image .
as you can see , you need to copy files from folders and copy them again . so if you want to ask for the inser@@ tion of the involved CD . if you want to avoid any trouble , just like the m@@ ess Br@@ ing of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the images that you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click on Current View in menu privacy . alternatively , you can also lock all pictures that can see your little sister , filtering and select the menu item everything except modern view .
this allows you to set out which images in the case of the fall you want to be hidden . if you want to block the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu item that you want to be locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click Sper@@ re up@@ lift .
it is also possible to set a password that has to be entered to un@@ lock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe . for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml can only read the password as un@@ encrypted text ; this type of password protection serves only to those who are using &amp; sound@@ ing album ; not very familiar to cap@@ tivate the view of private pictures .
the reason you can manage all your pictures with &amp; sound@@ ing album ; manage and hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason it has a picture _ and Video@@ Pad . this is why you can preview the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , just drag and drop it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is available to the viewer . all these options are available from right @-@ clicking on the viewer . you can see the text @-@ menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , see the browser , see matching entries for this . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all the pictures by Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen .
if you loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus .
a very useful skill of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is in full screen mode switch . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can jump into the picture and zoom out . with the mouse button you can drag a rectangle . with the minus key , you can throw again zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ omed in the middle of the picture . shows how an zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed to zoom . with the equation @-@ key , the zoom key consists of the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel of the image .
notice that the only zoom operations work with videos that come in and zo@@ oming with the plus and the key key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can view it down and open configuration dialog of the image to insert it . however , you might prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what pictures you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you look at one by one .
for the two examples above , the spect@@ ator gives you the opportunity to paint pictures with characteristics , while you are viewing it . characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can set a characteristic by clicking the appropriate letters . in view , see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you &apos;ve set any features on your images , these are available to you . so if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what ever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can display categories in your thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by pressing the letter for the index after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint a photo album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ own your old later .
in the picture , you can see a picture painted on the painted pictures . in order to switch the painting on the context menu . to finish the painting , simply drag the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; do you need to control the application of the program &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation about &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties , and the object in the wire @-@ plates are shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected using the object .
to insert a new object into the object @-@ tree , select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Settings menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following men@@ op@@ per menu appears , so you can choose the correct position :
with Del@@ eting either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on the application to apply these changes . if you have dis@@ connected values , a message is displayed with a bug description . then you can right click the input box and then re @-@ use the changes to break down .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the object shown by means of help .
you need the &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L users , in order to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the peculi@@ ar view .
click Pre@@ view in the peculi@@ ar view and a small sample of the scene is sign@@ posted with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is selected , even if you want a sub@@ merged element ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the whole window .
each object has a wire @-@ level of visibility . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object , or as an absolute value . objects will only appear if they are selected or their visibility to be smaller or equal to the selected stage of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window @-@ setting as default . the object tree and the view of the object tra@@ its are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can freely adjust it . you can also save several windows of window @-@ orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window on or under a view , drag the beginn@@ er to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginn@@ er to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views over each other , draw the beginn@@ er in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map folder on the top of the views .
the last possible window @-@ order are Swedish views : views that are not included in the main window . to view a view from the anchor , drag the beginn@@ er to the desktop or click the little to the left arrow icon in the connector .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the toolbar . to prevent the closing , click on the little square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them to any position .
the current window view can be saved in view window @-@ order ... saving it . a dialog displays , in which you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
when you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . when this manual was written , was &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is currently supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or select the menu navigation menu .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full photos of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or in the menu View menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , useful , but a name that lets you detect the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can fill the width and height of the cro@@ pped image . if you just want to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality you can select the characteristics that uses &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user Guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if an image is wi@@ ped out with only one beam per pixel , there may be different errors . these paintings often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or trim effects in curves and lines , besides , sometimes details are not shown , if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature are better off .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling requires the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive , recur@@ sively , because every pixel is still further divided and adap@@ tive because the refle@@ x @-@ depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method to select POV @-@ Ray one ray per pixel . if the difference between the dy@@ es to the neighb@@ oured pixels was taken with super sampling . if you adjust the repository value to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values given the pre@@ defined threshold , the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are tr@@ acked separately and on further classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the low @-@ depth .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn out J@@ it@@ tering , alters &amp; po@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount in order to avoid regular patterns .
the final attitude for the quality of the ren@@ ces is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no property made .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu Post@@ script file Im@@ ported ... and choose a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command of &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; . if you encounter any error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ an end .
you can drag objects from the object tree to editor to export the source code for &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the editor opened . to import objects in the scene , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also in your editor .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help menu view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; user account documentation displayed here . set the path to your documentation and the version . here are the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude difference ) to the &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also list the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color will be used for viewing the selected control points .
the colour of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ marks .
you can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the R@@ aster separate for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed amplifier for two directions .
if you cross the High Details Lad@@ ue for extended proj@@ ections , all wire Model messages will be further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . enhanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is wi@@ ped out . the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the ground , a bottom is shown below the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ at@@ eness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method uses for the ren@@ ders of the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more detailed information on parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window maps or create new window orders . in the section pane orders , you can create and store windows .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard @-@ window @-@ order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window @-@ order when starting the program .
the list available window orders , displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be added to the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , and remove a selected arrangement with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each window @-@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be added to the button Add and delete selected views with the button &apos; button .
the position of the new window . with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with in@@ lets you anchor the window below the existing window , with map view , together with the previous view and ho@@ vering over the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you will get as a result just a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ ders as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert a light source , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following sub@@ set window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . read the documentation , so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire Model View shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you create . in particular , you notice the scene of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this is the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details about it .
don &apos;t change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is later tutorials , but note that the camera can change in view Control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
when you apply the button or press the input button , the wire Model views and the slide @-@ tree will change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader for example ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a bit @-@ bit method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually provides an easier option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or press Enter . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
now the wire @-@ design view also indicates the level , although at the moment only as a limited European level . when you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
when you see the object tree accurately , you will find that you can cl@@ ap the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should shift the soil to exercise an unit under the sky@@ line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
just choose the soil to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something different at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is inserted in . please select the object tree . you can preview the name in the object tree ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks right now .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a matt @-@ black material because you have to insert settings for the pigment yet . therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but you now take the easiest .
if you are unable to preview any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button below and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now correctly set . if you want to ren@@ ders your picture now by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . which you have expected . here are some more settings necessary . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently but the chess @-@ board menu list can only be used with two colors ) :
select in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features :
this step should you simply be able to perform , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have already understood the ball as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button to push ) , so the ball rolling out over the ground , since you have moved the ground around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now gives a strange result : how to see earlier , the ball surface appears like a matt @-@ black material . set the following step an appropriate material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose the subject object and change the name for example in ball pigment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , choose then mon@@ ar@@ ly and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve even more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values like in the following screenshots and press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection comes already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene ray@@ trac@@ en , that ren@@ ders the ren@@ derer from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that displays the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the r@@ ender is calculated , like this ray through the objects and is broken , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how can affect atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels be edited for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene which should be framed , some light sources and at least a camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file which you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if a new file , you have to enter a name and space .
represents the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage can be rejected .
this menu entry can only be chosen if you have not stored stored changes in the scene .
repeated the least und@@ es@@ irable command . this menu entry can only be used if you have used editing them .
saves the current window @-@ order and opens a dialog when you type a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cuts and behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can edit or add new commands with this option for &quot; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &quot; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove the commands .
a B@@ ump map is a way to apply rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump map as well as a texture Map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic bodies . these models are then further edited to give them a real look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ec@@ show ; is a more comfortable picture @-@ controlled and navig@@ ator . the application has a file browser which allows you to choose images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; J@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists the files you can play with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window or whether any images always use the same window .
if you are searching for a particular file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . if a password file name is found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field through the press of Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ ec@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can adjust the working method of a cud@@ d@@ lock ; set in the two other , short command for the display window and short command for the browser , you can set the keyboard short@@ cut for the respective window .
if this is selected then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can further down . default is not a full screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; cud@@ dle ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; upon closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in the screen to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image is filled , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can display &amp; cud@@ dle ; to set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which the program can also represent .
with this option for big images display the display window on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
place if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time between the picture change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field .
the number of repeti@@ tions . this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field .
change here the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of use &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; in the card cards short commands for the display window and short command for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for files ) and the merged view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big symbols for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
displays small icons for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
displays thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in short delivery .
res@@ ized the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ k@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser windows is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of each fil@@ ename you search . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; KDE ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ pack ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ time photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ tization ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast editing process with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
as the rest of &amp; KDE ; is a show@@ time photo ; an open source project . this means it is dependent upon that the user supports its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible errors or possible improvements to log in . if you are also in the program , the menu includes an entry reports you need problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to reports from problems and wishes . all required information are already filled , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; present , and hopefully soon answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to answer any questions by other users . in this mailing list , you should be powerful in this language .
the best way to take part in &amp; show@@ down ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; attempts to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to choose the Settings menu ; to set up the setup dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing the symbols of the left .
in the field of exposure inde@@ xes , you can select the color that is indicated when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicators should be selected , in contrast to what you are supposed to display in contrast . sub@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure to dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; features a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and promotions about the selected images . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ il@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scan of images that do not make more than images to scan and storing .
&amp; sk@@ il@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scan and storing images that do not make more than images to scan and to save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also view the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ el@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ ant@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner .
the user can select the scanner and click OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; sk@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ e@@ an@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
to view a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can also zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in the window that the complete preview in the window will fit .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the Scan button &apos; button .
if you want to preview a preview in the settings , then the picture is displayed in a preview window , displayed below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lie ? s leads to a break@@ age and you get back to the main window .
thanks to the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , pre @-@ review before saving . in this case the option is to be displayed before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option is to be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way you want to store them . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ id ; these automatically save with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to save money without having to ask for a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are stored with the option to save after a file name . when the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored picture gets a numerical Su@@ ff@@ ix the each time a picture is saved . the string value # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the KDE support with the &amp; cable mount ; -@@ manual . the button About will start the KDE Over @-@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ im ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below is a list of this cuts and its function . the global short@@ cuts can set you up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short command .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short rest function . thus , make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly to be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP features of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , playlist and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function break &amp; example ; to look like this :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user an feedback if the script should not be executed with a lack of dependency . please check if all the required modules are present and use c@@ dialog to make the user ID , why a script does not exp@@ ire .
begin Lu@@ und@@ um &apos;s Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos;@@ Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or you can simply enhance the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to any KDE installation .
most scripts allow the running of external programs and commands . in this way , the Ex@@ ec function ( ) function is used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . to this cause , strings to the standard input of script . for this reason , script should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should also ignore when there is no use for it .
configure the script to view the furnishings dialog . to store the storing and loading of the furniture data , any script should take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the desktop folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
it is sign@@ aled that a new piece is all@@ uded . the script may now be called for example ; with D@@ COP functions further information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece ) .
volume @-@ change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ ff : sub@@ menu item with unveil@@ ed the path to select the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu commands may also be identified . to remove an entry , you can use the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ Script . to remove your name d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ Script on V@@ custom@@ men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; stops , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ thing ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded by a web server . such packages are basically normal t@@ ar @-@ archives ( .t@@ mp ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , which allows the user to detect the archive clearly as the Amar@@ o@@ script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of me@@ gab@@ ran@@ ds . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right .
the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter to get the file rights :
if your script is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and get the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; hung up for your entry on KDE apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to pass through endless menus . maybe you are also searching for a very specific title from thousands of records in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; s Colle@@ ct Browser and the Quick Search will find you to find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many general USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , allowing SI@@ E to listen to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ is is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , one has to enter the following folder of the Amar@@ o@@ sources the following : to compile Amar@@ o@@ then and install :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and fe@@ eder used , you should have no difficulties when compile them . if you encounter any problems , please report it in the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has like most applications some options that can enable or disable the configure script using the configure script or disable it . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty over the furnishings dialog . the furnishings dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
player window displaying the player window in addition to playlist or off . when the option is off , only the play@@ lists window is attached .
mood bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ our was compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
form of voting : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ our was compiled . thus , the scheme of the scheme is changed for the mood bar@@ ometer .
sing@@ ular files are stored in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ les has been compiled . otherwise , the .@@ re files stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ do@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start when a browser is needed .

playlist when storing , the current playlist automatically saves at the end of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist while exercising .
relative paths for manual stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , it will use Amar@@ o@@ thing ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of the music files .

the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ screen monitor environment should appear to the OS@@ D .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for collection .
here you can select the folder that is to search for music files . to browse a folder to the collection , select the tick field next to his name . this section also includes links areas for inser@@ ting , as should be used with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively browse : this causes the fact that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the h@@ ubs as well as their sub@@ folder after music is displayed .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like for example ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots .
Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; needed some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . G@@ omas will function so , but flu@@ x@@ box will help for example . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably you will see one of your files an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can read the file by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang out the broken file that has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly lies that Tag@@ lib when reading Meta information out of this file is cr@@ ashes . please report this mistake to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is something mature .
make sure that all libraries were compiled by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when the libraries were compiled with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , day Li@@ b , but with GCC 3,@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to the editing of Meta information .
if you are using KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate it . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value from 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens up automatically with a crash ) and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program writes data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 to meta information , but they do not mark as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ V@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ thing ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic playlist ) can be displayed in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can find the status de@@ activated on gra@@ u and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ is uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zing Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems arise at ligh@@ test by means of an expert of your UNI@@ X@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . do they also use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ o@@ .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search . please enter there only one error if you do something at the removal of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears to be only one blank playlist . how do music appear there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under extras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the playlist should be displayed in the playlist ; click on the title list of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the review for one piece . you can also use the short command line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press releas@@ ing on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then choose from the playlist .
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and let them fall there exactly as you would do with other files too . so simple is this : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , is the button playlist . click on it .
probably you lack the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . also look after li@@ b@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( right click on the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one of the baked independent approach , therefore the real question are what kind media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can support so fairly every conceivable audio format . G@@ spre@@ amer can even help text and PNG .
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 de@@ dé@@ c@@ or are supplied ( made of pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , Sub@@ et@@ aste
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device requires a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be reached by a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software mix@@ er ) . look at the help of the D@@ SA for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem of a problem and a solution . for G@@ spre@@ amer you have to specify a different s@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does not do so . don &apos;t forget that media can first be de@@ coded . G@@ spre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ c@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can be directly at AL@@ SA , just as well as x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound system . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real@@ time @-@ time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper sh@@ id is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause gest@@ ed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead to get G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ins driver has been optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less jobs respond to visu@@ al@@ isations , please help us to fix it .
G@@ spre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ ent components .
read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download qu@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST regi@@ sters again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
please report about it below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can list the rating for a piece by clicking on a column list in the play@@ lists window . then select a review . then you can select the rating of a piece just as the other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and edit . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want to give you when you are going to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have established a specified publishing plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of tuning and thus also a lot of errors .
probably &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile this output module . you have to configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output module has still not appear . and now ?
probably you are using a distribution , installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files will need to install . that &apos;s the same also for x@@ ins , you must install x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re @-@ compile and install again .
I consider the mistake G@@ rout@@ ing Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ spre@@ amer was compiled with p@@ add@@ ling , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ spreading . you will need to compile G@@ spre@@ amer without p@@ endant . a tip of Mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no LD@@ FLA@@ GS when you compiled Amar@@ o@@ ok .

set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue a . this function will be played next .
used as play@@ lists ... - stores the selected pieces as play@@ lists . they are asked for a name where the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into queue for transfer to media player . more details can be found in the section about the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn to CD - Dad@@ ant , the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not appear .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into du@@ st@@ bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , which will show it among various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing up - changes one as a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer displayed among various interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the playlist browser designed the handling of many play@@ lists is quite simple . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ lig@@ ente play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent playlist . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the intelligent playlist consists of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that never played before .
even self @-@ designed play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ lig@@ ente playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to interpreter sorted in the top list of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list . if you are finished , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be loaded onto your iPod . when the transfer is completed , finish &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and release the drive binding for your iPod .
under the toolbar you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you can get a address bar with which you can get music from a embedded URL . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z and press Enter , you can access music from there in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop music from there in the playlist .
if the playlist longer is used than in the window , the breakdown of files by simple case can be difficult . in the case , the susp@@ end of the Shift key may be helpful : thereby falling files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the wall position .
the playlist runs all of you to play attached pieces . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries into the desired place . once you enter the letters , only the pieces are displayed , the letters contain . to reset the filter , press the button again , until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , will contain &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; according to entries included all search criteria . if you enter for example one by two , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , you will find for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces will be found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you would like to search for entries , then include the search term with da@@ isi@@ es : Mike Old@@ field . by doing this , I searched for entries that Mike Old@@ field is included , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces , which do not contain something .
you can combine these synthetic ingredients according to popularity . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces , which either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then clicking the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the toolbar at the bottom of the window is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you can add the button Add that you can add to the playlist pieces . to the right next , you will save play@@ lists , play@@ lists empty and random M@@ alian .
next , the buttons are easy to return and restore . so you can und@@ one or restore changes to the playlist or recover .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button on the toolbar button is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the Player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration set up .
there are still many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar button on the toolbar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information to play@@ lists . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . the status for random mode and re@@ boot can be easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . please turn the status bar on the status bar in the general settings .
the context menu is accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . over this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plugins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry a sub@@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can launch them by choosing the cover code administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to be displayed in the Cover Management . select from :
the queue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you still have more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will first play , 2 as a second , and so on .
to manage the queue open over extras @-@ long management . if you want to add the queue a piece , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces to use the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to the establishment of these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during the reproduction .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that already some pieces in your playlist are . you don &apos;t need a load / f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist .
click double the desired playlist , drag them into the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select load . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ issued modes of random mix and play@@ lists will immediately fill your playlist and you can start the playback directly . the playlist vessel starts with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of piece , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the button again fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the opportunity to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for coming pieces will be passed over and they will be heard in this playlist , however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed , taking into consideration the setting of playing pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces added after each played piece for play@@ lists . if you set up more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece is played and can be removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , will add &amp; Amar@@ o@@ thing ; random pieces from each of the listed play@@ lists will add .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Settings .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on script . once you have installed the script , a new entry will be installed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button further scripts .
if you want to no longer use a script for longer , you can delete it . choose the script to delete the script then click D@@ ein@@ stall .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please check in section writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugins becomes an activation of available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply tick the tick@@ ping field next to the name .
this quick guide aims to show you how to create a audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you can create an audio CD . to track the steps , you must have a capable installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss of sli@@ pped compressed formats , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is received , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .

l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 Decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial En@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder Module .
FLA@@ C : one free open source code c for los@@ sy audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ ding module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to then burn them onto a audio CD
So@@ x : a relief program that can go down between different audio formats and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder Module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the functional fully equipped authorization system for updating , assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video @-@ CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can be useful for example for creating ge@@ pur@@ ged CD &apos;s and m@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different po@@ tions of the various albums can lead to the unpleasant effect which the tunes can be reproduced differently according to the type of music .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to launch CD and re@@ distribute all videos on the basic folders on the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects re@@ charging projects again . the relevant sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been stored once again , the previously set file is over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same if you would like to save to each individual project file .
includes the current project . when a project has changed and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what to happen . you can then switch between saving and modifications . besides , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closed all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will inqu@@ ire for each not stored project what is to happen , just as if you &apos;ve been called for each project file .
closed all opened projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each not stored project is asked , what to happen so as if you would have been called a file .
if you access this entry , you can select from entering the dialog files for adding a project . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view to the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the files are added in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described about the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be used with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it led to import &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; files from the previous session will always be involved , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can already see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function prompted &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to import files from the current project . all other files are stored in the project . this feature does not remove files from the medium , it blin@@ ded only the previously imported files .
opens the Copy CD dialog . this also allows copying a CD to a different medium . alternatively you can also only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later on . you should also prefer folding if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the Copy DVD @-@ dialog . this also allows copying DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image from a DVD , which you then will then burn later . also , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . so you can delete all of the contents or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ o over@@ write and incre@@ mentally .
burns a previously established CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g -@@ files are currently not supported , for this you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously extended DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously @-@ recorded DVD movie can be transm@@ uted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used all @-@ standing , but it contains information about the extrac@@ ted video , enco@@ ding settings , and even options for changing the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed medium . this information is displayed in the table and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is tick@@ ed , the toolbar at the currently visible in the main window .
if this is tick@@ ed , a small bar on the bottom of the window will display . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not addressed , the status bar is hidden .
enables the folder view or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the screen view is activated , its content is displayed in the index view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info , lock and removal of the drive or throwing the media .
divi@@ des the index view or off . the table view allows the select and drop files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
divi@@ ding the header bar in the view view , or off . the head bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that is only visible when the Project View open projects . the header bar has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project perspectives clear from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to modify the button classi@@ fications for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the short@@ cut to it below .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture wizard . so you can use the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this reason , privileges must enter the password for the system ste@@ er ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here general programs can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should function on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and to fine tuning the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; KDE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface is equipped with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use the functions , you can either use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality , so is more your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the program programs give you a move .
in this chapter we suppose that you use the command line utility d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you must first make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , all of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ program reported , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : .@@ K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project through # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data @-@ project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :

&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read for &amp; KDE ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s are read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on your computer .
&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that are enco@@ ded ( compressed ) default for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss of files ) . additional co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they were installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is compiled by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie up ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary to compile some Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ ders will need to be installed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which enco@@ ding / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction on enco@@ ders , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for the reading of audio data from the &amp; CD ; . this program is not intended to handle any copying audio CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD &apos;s device is not possible to handle any protected audio CD ; do not prevent the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while it has to be done only once ( the furnishings dialog ) , but can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration found ) , the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explained . this results ( hopefully ) to understand the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble in the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can fetch a CD ; information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information how this program is used as well as scre@@ enshot with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of your request in the tab toolbar . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet needs to be established . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the Memory Card enco@@ ding in the furniture catalogue - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , allowing the selection to be read with any other Encoder which can be read as the standard . it is observed that before en@@ coder is configured in the dialog menu settings in the layout dialog .
opens the file manager so that one already selected file is selected for enco@@ ding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the way dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programs ( such as read the &amp; CD ; stops ) .
opens the main alignment dialog by &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you to choose the right enco@@ ders .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may possibly be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information generated by data compres@@ sing depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG tend to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions available free of charge but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a machine based music system and / or when one of the few existing O@@ GG ab@@ elle devices is present .
MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should typically offer for most people and most of the music fans accepted transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi@@ fi tes@@ ters with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . needs more and 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need c@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate , about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . well enough for the music of young people , portable devices and car parks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually inserted or retri@@ eved by the program from the free@@ DB program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / sell with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ fication program for the folder and file name , as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programming concepts for the code of the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the code editors explain the switches for these programmes .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to add the keywords ( English : day ) , if MP@@ 3@@ s must be coded by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; D audi@@ tions ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
that is what the free@@ DB file is : a free database where people can download the audio CD releases , so that all others can download this information instead of being inserted into the calculator . it is noted that here only by text is said : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ger ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information no more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ated . all information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physically or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to choose a tick @-@ field ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address while retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may not only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphically will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates to the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; whoever wants to know more accurately , look in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed from the suitable distribution first if this has not yet happened .
to store the read @-@ read WAV files the code can be selected and thus the file format selected for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ sy @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab of the enco@@ ders . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , further information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ pane window ( console ; Con@@ sole ) will be replaced by the name of the installed code .
that can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading process , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you are not a copy audio CD ; read out . check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , everything understood but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile the source files , what you can of course always do .
please be sure to copy the directory / usr / share / cd , and that you have scre@@ w@@ ns on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something with the Con@@ quer@@ or . )
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which probably needs to be done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each aus@@ ite &amp; CD ;
here we determine the to used Ko@@ di@@ zer to compres@@ sing the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting tone quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are lazy , we can use the program using the free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet to load .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will likely not change them with any configuration of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device drawing is delivered to the read @-@ out program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real equipment drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is available , the effective device name can also be accessed . if you can access the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device name for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General settings . here , there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only in case of un@@ complete information please select so that you will be notified if data are missing by keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet , while the Internet has to be connected to the Internet , so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry was found immediately , when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ ename names / fil@@ ename , or fil@@ ename , you can easily change . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed using Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; name and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , it continues to be noted : if you want to manually enter all the selection fields and free@@ DB mode , if you download the database first . however , it is worth over 6@@ 20 MB , consider whether this is worthwhile . to free@@ ze the two selection fields , the two selection fields must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . set it all the way it pic@@ tured in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , as though many fire@@ walls have to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit a CD ; data to the free@@ DB server and de@@ activate the first tick @-@ field should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of the scre@@ enshot now . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number at the same time allow@@ ance pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time just one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and code ? the author knows not , therefore simply trying themselves .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick@@ ing this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : if you are tick@@ ing the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored , the files will not be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files .
all just enter as it is in the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something to be le@@ ased to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is an average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 &apos; only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Day for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
use the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously to enco@@ ding WAV files : when dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to enco@@ ding more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; terminated . this configuration is chosen as a standard for any reading a &amp; CD ; used when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; installed on the hard disk , the folder structure , which is organized in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be collected , has to be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD ; use the screenshots below a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successful from free@@ DB files . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data will manually enter , instead of taking it out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not find the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window , being pushed up .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , just as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; when audio CD ; be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you look for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the default settings .
note : if the &amp; CD ; done successfully from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces have already been completed and in addition , the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears in l@@ ends and you can choose the database entry that suits your opinion the best for your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have selected the tick@@ ed box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger you by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input &apos; News &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist should no longer be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ eller title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ so@@ ya per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of the data from the free@@ DB code , the CD editor will not be empty , but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor . however , it is always a good idea to begin the content of the CD editor ( for example , if all words begin with large letters , or not ... ) , but also to consider if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have un@@ limited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up in the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; default settings &apos; .
you can change the tag posted on the day later , with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the manual for the Ko@@ di@@ van to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the aus@@ al CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data any@@ how we go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example will be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to main window . simply click on the row with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album have already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
note that there has been a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . simply clicking on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at one time .
was started by clicking the button selection reading the reading process , so this window appears to confirm . OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what they proceed .
click the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the top half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left corner of the window in the status line .
this error message will see if you &apos;re trying to work with a enco@@ ders that you have not installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder of the tmp file and the target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and code parallel . notice the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . for efficient machines the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ ting and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title will be read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the codi@@ le . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be shown with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today will be enter@@ tained within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the C@@ ulti@@ media package . if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can already download an anonymous copy . most distribution programs already contain a pre @-@ compiled package . if you &apos;re reading this package , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to individuals who compiled source files and are not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be customized to your needs when it runs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many varieties of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screenshots of different card cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on this site , without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially when it is at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
why is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not maintain this manual . it is meant as the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; think . whoever wants to add or change anything else , may it do . at least , after contacting the author . and when you read this , he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion .
strange when we have succeeded in bringing the source file from &amp; KDE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er from &amp; KDE ; in addition to others it has a real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; C@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and KDE ; &amp; C@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultra @-@ at proj@@ ector , which is required for the CIS .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the text text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical presentation of the activity of any MIDI channel when high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go to &amp; KDE ; any MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window on the Mid set .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song@@ writing or textile events ) . K@@ Mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish and KDE , during playing a song , K@@ mid will start again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will fall . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and enter the button kno@@ b in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or choose the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid @-@ window . ( with multiple pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; K@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth .
when you find that a song is too fast or too slow to play , you can click the arrows left and right of the tem@@ po@@ ad and then change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ on LCD .
the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar appears like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts the reproduction . if you play the spac@@ eb@@ ar during no play , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the reproduction .
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use textile past@@ ure , others use lyrics , others use lyrics text and again others . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected to enable a song , so you do not have to manually set an item for automatic shut@@ ters . you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up a reminder type , select from the menu settings on the entries or property events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . those are being played in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . these can be found in the menu collection under the point of Organ@@ ize .... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the scripts in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs that you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not stored . please check this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in collecting managers . there you can add adding a song using the button Add . it appears in turn the file dialog , using whose help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , one piece by opening ( using file Open or drag &amp; Drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically added to the collection is not activated , when opening one piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add the continued to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click R@@ emo@@ ve .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence according to the sub@@ menu section of the menu items , the songs are played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
when you select songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to keep a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or push the button arrow to the right .
to jump back down a song , select the button preceding piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or push the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it will not be saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general MIDI events translated into events that understands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , which conver@@ ts all the events of Type Change to B@@ right Piano in Events of Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound@@ cards GM are compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file containing all required re@@ ments for the playing of a piece .
each section must appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section that may appear as many times as desired . however , a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ...
you see that de@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of an section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI can be pic@@ tured on your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the Equ@@ al sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line to one of 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes , which will take this instrument to put the tone with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is like a gun . to this end , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI @-@ file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun loading ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that the patch is meant here with the term drum patch of the patch ( drum , basin , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one who means the sound of the sound of the same drum ( like him possess some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to indicate how sound is pic@@ tured on a certain channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ section the order of lines is very important , as well as the presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
keyboard maps are used mainly to form tones on the per@@ p @-@ channel channel . check out for example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel exchange , simply take it in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion on a certain channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
n is included in the channel , which is depic@@ ted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will of course be defined further into the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events are ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , then patch x will be used .
the option For@@ ce@@ patch can be useful for example to use the Per@@ c@@ ist patch on the per@@ p channel channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Ratio is to be multiplied by the ratio of Pit@@ ch pet@@ ting events . so if a MIDI @-@ file sends a pitch using the value , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make no dec@@ imal file in the map file ) .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ gasoline @-@ event with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher to play . unfortunately , try some key@@ boards higher up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ als you see which sounds are currently playing .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can select an instrument , the kno@@ b will not be green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to indicate the pointed tones . view in the Settings menu under the Point View : Settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so , for example you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can comp@@ el no one , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression dis@@ proportion of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files separately .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; C@@ mid @-@ window .
activate previously the setting Autom@@ atically Ad@@ ding to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can switch from the arrow to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD panel .
I have one &amp; KDE ; desktop desktop a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or sw@@ inging on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file only in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file fast , without adding them into a collection , turn off automatic adding to collection , and the new ; file will add to temporary collection
suppose that you will have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first , you only want to play the first file . so you set the setup automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then includes exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . to all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , continue to program .
&amp; C@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I am in the third year , so I am not much free time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to take me a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a Mi@@ di@@ / / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI @-@ file I will send me under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI @-@ file , however , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; K@@ mid ; complete in my spare time and won &apos;t make any money for anyone . I want to stress that I &apos;m just about programming , because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Stage - Pro@@ clamation of the bug , that the pitch is too high for A@@ we cards .
my thanks goes also Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the CIS support , and Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ we support , Buddha Pet@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us M@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault @-@ informed or also only a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us this wonderful Mi@@ dian and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage which is under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ quit@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can look at the development , information and view images . you will also find links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends much from your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music .
if trouble occur , please contact one of the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error @-@ informed directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , Ph@@ ono , and FF@@ m@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as playback DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; KDE ; installed on this machine .
for more information please check The KDE website on new releases or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made from called and@@ ular windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window which only then displayed when information is reproduce .
it is possible to split the preferred link@@ ages under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played to each other , so you should use the category of thum@@ b playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy . if you choose an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups to the current category will be copied and playback starts with the indicated entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , TV and thum@@ b playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can do that only when &amp; k@@ m@@ player / apps / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can be modified using a category , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ ck@@ le that is displayed in the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or another category .
all changes will be lost when the mode mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start@@ up and finishing can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c and Change of &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted simply .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will follow the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during start@@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening another source . this would be disrup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; and / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ ist &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ ist &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ geni@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; sr@@ c ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ su@@ gt ; It is in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path of the M@@ player and the clip@@ board size can be adjusted from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &quot; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special area Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to give the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; into HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player must be specified as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type and / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishings dialog file of KDE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or Bet@@ k@@ m@@ player ; is available in an consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error occurs , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
therefore always a given back@@ end for a given MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on must reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner must be used in dialog box , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected some ports ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably included a DV@@ B in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video , this type of playing of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al source , default source , source , source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist .
are there any indication of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I don &apos;t play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as a user root after fixing the device . it &apos;s absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slow on , why does my CPU have to be tested for their performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ m@@ t. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time will x@@ ins check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical username and network support and is required to comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ; required .
l@@ atex ; : a professional extension application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be transferred to the package &amp; tex@@ tured ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution of Linux . for installation , the documentation of the distribution / installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the ki@@ le ; website .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; and KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users can hardly read this manual too . however , all suggestions for the documentation is taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation should be desired , the contact about the ki@@ le ; website must be established .
if you have questions to or in the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; at or will be desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; working surface . &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers the possibility for complete , comp@@ iling , post @-@ processing and troubles@@ hooting for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be drawn to K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can start directly with reading the chapters with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .

just like other label languages involves &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the gener@@ alized features like paper format , side numbered and text @-@ gr@@ ind with text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class , the king commen@@ ces with the command \ \ by { document } , and must be closed again with the command \ \ by } document } .
the rapid entry @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a nÃ ¼ ous function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( men@@ ace ) provides some features for the document creation . it can also be made some of the settings related to it .
document categories : hereby the type of the document is known : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ am@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ aper &#93; , films &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or &#93;
enco@@ ding : this is hereby set the blue@@ print of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; documents ) .
this list includes the most used additional packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for the involvement they only have to be rolled .
article ( DIN ) , A ( DIN ) , A ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German regulations ) . you should always find the use of German texts .
new users now do not have to worry about . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; a simple problem @-@ looking text is not closed . you &apos;ll notice it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and time r@@ ack@@ down .
with automatic filling of the environment is generated by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically create a space line ( to the input of the text ) and the above mentioned line to mould ( e.g. \ \ by } command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu . set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; em@@ fies the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common element ) :
in the view of the document in structure , the single elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click on each of them .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful the R@@ Ã ¼ rich file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ oun File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ spect@@ ator to the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the appropriate output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and for printing of DVI ; files for different systems and scent .
when using the grid search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file has been clicked on the DVI ; -@@ source code was clicked on the exact opposite of it . the default option is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was clicked , becomes the appropriate place in the DVI ; observer file .
Master &apos;s document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , the work is made with other em@@ .@@ tex files . when using a project can be set up a project @-@ wide master document project settings .
quick @-@ making : the l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file name : in this mode , the DVI ; file on the subject of n@@ ak@@ e@@ â viewed , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the quick @-@ making .
when considering the editing toolbar , the three major selection fields should be noticeable . the selection fields have been developed for the fast setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the classification are :
the selection field further is for the addition of articles such as keywords , fu@@ cking notes or references . the options available are :
name : with this command a term for a section is created , an image or other element .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed term ( selection of a selection field ) .
when using quote will display a selection list with literary ones . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file is necessary to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written also in &amp; ki@@ le ; written by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ ind is used for defining the font . it enables the fonts to select the main text , the fu@@ ck notes etc. set . there are the following fonts for installation :
in the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices options to add : 1 . the wizard shows the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and proper settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand on hand .
the brackets at the \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . if the let@@ tering is not at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; single source code has to be compiled . the easiest way is to make use of building construction or but@@ ton@@ ic quick @-@ making .
the source code must be saved from the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically exp@@ elled .
the comp@@ iling of the document fails , should be searched in the logging for the errors . when using fast installation should be started &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; this is not the case , should also be taken into account details .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size is created 12 . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ by { environment } ) .
the functions are cleared only within the vicinity ( from \ \ begin } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there are no signs ( number ) for the edi@@ tor@@ ing within an environment .
there are many features to improve the read@@ ability of read@@ ability and usability of the document . it enables you to place for example certain fonts , fat pressure , elec@@ tive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , either with the command \ \ by command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is until it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : establishes a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { ratio } , and ends with \ \ by { ratio } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; drawing language is shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once in the wizard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there should be min@@ d. a quote , a few places in the air and course of course and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document was viewed , using Editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and Spa@@ ak .
DVI ; is a framed file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ um ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer created . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the Dru@@ cken of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document es ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar button is the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file is created from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code , the conversion is beginning to begin with the buttons in the toolbar .
the preliminary search for the direct jump from the editor to the common position within the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . this must be composed only Modern under settings ki@@ le ... tools building design .
in order to find the precau@@ tions , the mouse pointer is positioned in a line of the source text and attach it to the first clicks . the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; it is done with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; appropriate and attached to the corresponding line ; for this must be defined &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ rug ; as a text editor ( attitudes Ok@@ kup@@ ation ... Editor )
should the use of quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; viewers can not allow a mistake to exist . should an error be available , this will appear in the log file or in the message window summary .
the log file ob@@ tains the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the buttons related between the errors . the log file will always be used the line in which the error appears . to see the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the errors in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once you click on the respective button on the toolbar , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the proposed features are :
with selection of empty document , a document can be either written or used either by reason or the wizard for a fast creation of a new document . additional information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . designs can be produced in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; -@@ file created or create a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; a new template to create an existing document and selection of file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using a file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings ki@@ osk ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TIO@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the additions to the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , the original template will be used instead of default .
a template can be created from all &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created a simple way to create a template , should be looked after one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal Editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the features of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; K@@ ate ; can be made in the menu item directly out &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his features should be drawn to K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can go there directly with reading the chapters with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be called the menu @-@ help La@@ Te@@ X reference guide . it includes a detailed description of nearly all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ clicking C@@ trl key to fal@@ si@@ fy the &amp; tex ; that means in this way by clicking on \ \ by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ness just \ \ par .
when pulling the text with the left mouse button the selected text is automatically copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can use the arrow keys you can use parts of the source text in the editing pane .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the features to browse through different types of sources of source and to highlight it . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assist@@ ants can include one type of book@@ marks inside the text . it is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . it is also highlighted the jump to the next or the final spr@@ ing@@ mark . this jumping brand is highlighted , so that it is automatically generated when entering a sign .
the edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent features were added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions are added to writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; user source ; special commands for their selection . under Edi@@ ting You are included the following commands to the text selection :
if a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines , included on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning coinci@@ des with tables , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source . this extended meaning coinci@@ des with tables , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source . the only bent thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore the one that are separated by two blank lines .
coat the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also has an extended star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to release a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by wires the button will be removed . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the scanning process . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers its own commands to create a faster result . under Edit R@@ emo@@ ve the following commands may contain the layout of the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of machining operations .
it has already illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF @-@ specific commands under machining surroundings for an effective , simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command leads to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to set the surroundings .
with this command will sc@@ ure the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to fly the surroundings .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ &apos; command \ \ begin } , the end of the st@@ alls is inj@@ ected at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many con@@ ta@@ tel@@ ted ambient command , this command will quickly go lost . this command conclude that the most recently opened environment , so that the scar@@ ed ambient structure will not be all@@ ot@@ ted .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from machining surroundings .
this command will sc@@ ure the current group at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in the cl@@ amp @-@ shaped cl@@ amp .
with this command will sc@@ ure the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly ring cl@@ amp .
when the cursor is behind or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many sp@@ las@@ hing @-@ cur@@ ly groups @-@ brackets , this command will not be lost . this command slept , so that the sp@@ las@@ hing structure of the &amp; tex ; groups did not disper@@ sed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two simple application marks as a grid . for the purpose of pur@@ pos@@ ing implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &apos; is used for two simple application marks . even for the filling of the demands , the sign is &quot; used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two being close enough for &amp; l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic filing of double bed can be set under settings Ki@@ le up ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be re@@ activated .
it can also be used L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and so that German or fran@@ che can be used . there are also many other languages available .
in the dr@@ y@@ way of shift ; input le@@ ased &amp; ki@@ le ; a smart line @-@ off ; if the current position is inside a lists ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example : en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not just a line @-@ break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , r@@ amp@@ t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ off @-@ closure .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be configured under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; sought to try this . after the next Tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this Tab@@ ulator is not enough to allow for the columns of the current Tab@@ ulator .
though &amp; K@@ ate ; already has a good source code performed , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to include specific commands ( usually for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still expanded . there are three different modes ( usually available for l@@ atex ; ) . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under settings ki@@ osk ... complete .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } is } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
by opening the R@@ Ã ¼ down the last letter of input will be removed and em@@ bell@@ ished the complete illustration . on the other hand , the list may also be res@@ ized by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are usually removed by choice of a command . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; ki@@ le ; also jumping Label , allows you to easily manage these positions by means of editing pads .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it enables you to choose different no@@ vices for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands as well as her@@ ds@@ man use of general speech should be rolled .
the command mode is for the perf@@ ecting of environments not next . there is always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the complete set mode will have a large list with ambient items . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the utilization of the environments .
in the call of the complete recycling + Shift key , the command to control the environment is automatic inserted , and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient noise can be continued in the easiest way and will be finished by wires of the input .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; real@@ ises that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is used .
under settings ki@@ le ; establish ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the default list of complete mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supporting custom lists of covers , which are instantly replaced by L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ ier strings . the lists can be set up under settings ki@@ le . as an example of a dra@@ fting list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
is , for example , the letter L entered and the word processor command ( reproduction or the but@@ cher trl + Alt + Shift , the letter L is replaced with the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
cru@@ de W@@ Ã ¤ r@@ Ã ¼ rich are not helpful for the automatic gener@@ alities . however , noted that many should be written more than once in a document . thus , it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the complete permits for all already written wound .
this mode can be set in the menu settings ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ perf@@ umes are being scre@@ ened . here the swelling can also be specified for the display of the inheritance .
the performed files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian home @-@ folder @-@ installed . mode is available for plantation ( cath@@ eter ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ rit@@ ing ) or tex .
the dialog elements include the addition of graphics as simple as possible . the view of the basics to the graphics formats should be taken and he@@ eded .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but also offer an excellent foundation for the lo@@ ot@@ ings and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF output will be re@@ arranged , so you can re@@ install the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to facilitate the result of the work , it must take advantage of the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into creating comp@@ iling , creation and creation view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard code by means of Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of the Alt ; 5 the PS file is seen .
when you use the command line fast , one observer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , each time has a new window .
a new project will be asked about the project new project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
in the exhau@@ sting of the fil@@ ename , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script feature of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the design of EC@@ MA@@ Script @-@ code . the scripts can be managed in the vertical bar .
the API @-@ scripts are not yet developed yet and can be found in further versions of &amp; ki@@ osk .
first , it has to be said that the scope of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le , a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite extended system , in which the basic functions can be expanded through a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help supporting the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included in this are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
a complete refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and e@@ cho@@ os@@ e@@ ering verb@@ ally . this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands contain and is ideal for a certain form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tured ; ex@@ tradi@@ ted , the finding of the right document does not always provide . as usual help , the small application ly@@ ri@@ k , which includes a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the top advantage is the search for parcel name or stroke . by &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are shown .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; . all of these tools use compres@@ s@@ ors as a surface and li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination gives rapid , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; KDE ; documentation has worked , known pro@@ c and how superior it is . we still lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finish !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the w@@ alled working folder . if not , then remove the current folder folder and enter the folder folder in the field of other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time , if supposed pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; KDE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; there is now a great graphical surface for it .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ bat is , then they simply leave the current folder folder . if not , then select current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is flaw@@ ed . please check the errors and try again .
if the file checked out is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; then they release current file easily . if not , delete them with current file the tick and select the file to be checked by using other file - file sel@@ ector .
if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review selection .
for the use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , and enter the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; for example , for the C@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG review is required to specify the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file sel@@ ector .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this used the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the al@@ locate file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; already marked , then release current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file menu option .
enter the name of the file as the result should be named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plugins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; even possibly have little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can immediately profit from the additional functionality and need not wait until someone can use the losing in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; files can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . elements can be found further below .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin with the Edit menu . this includes the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plugins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it :
here you can enter the search arrow . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
often on one project , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project like both team managers and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list , and the button is being put as an pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) is printed upon which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information regarding notes .
besides the overview of their team there is another benefit through the collection of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team managers when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that a file will be saved , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will add a file to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift , F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the address selected in the recipient list . the address sat can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leaders . see in , we@@ i will be set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple . it may either choose the note entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keywords in a commentary box followed by typ@@ ing text .
notes can be sent to an defin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the nickname of the nickname and sub@@ project leaders should be given a role in the project from the following possibilities : team ladder and sub@@ project leaders should be specified the respective range or sub@@ project names as stated in the following examples below .
nickname and roll names are independent of large or small @-@ arms , but spaces for the br@@ aces and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , which is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will only be treated via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by means of settings to set up ... this Th@@ ei@@ r dialog extends over several pages that are dealt with in succession .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; in terms of tags including car completion may be changed . the entries are :
large / small @-@ writing of tags : large / to@@ e of automatic tags . normal Large / batch prescription means , the tags are inserted as inserted in the day XML files .
large / small @-@ off of attributes : large / small @-@ off from automatically assigned attributes . normal Large / batch prescription means , the attributes are inserted as inserted in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically shut up : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
starting and finish tag automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ented characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during penetration .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . using the button default , the default ones can be recovered .
standard Dia enco@@ ding : enco@@ ding of newly created files or in other way than with open open files ( where enco@@ ding of the file can be passed over ) , but this setting here is spread from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . but this setting here is spread from the same in the project properties when a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; creates regularly backup copies , so that the document can be restored by this backup upon next start of the program . this is not the same as the storing of the file . it is not the same as the storing of the file . even if not stored documents is made regularly , accordingly .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editions or a separate view ( or the documentation in a map ) , what makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the default back next to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the MDI modes and and@@ rop@@ es / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line switches .
the War@@ n@@ eling area serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the display of warnings by hook of no longer queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it may be specified the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structural @-@ tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , set in details .
in the area of mouse click on the struc@@ wal@@ nut results , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse buttons .
in the area of struc@@ wal@@ nut settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alisation of the tree while working and how deep when changing the structural tree is to be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the area to commemor@@ ate abbreviations ( a type of templates ) which can be folded to large @-@ wide text . abbreviations is valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it means that it can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ist abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here you can manage the plugins . plugins are a part @-@ part applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , most of the best &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; read @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check if the plugin refused its charging . only @-@ c@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse the store when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; whether the entered information is correct even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gging has been completely new . Di@@ e@@ Support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead of this , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in was implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations about plugins .
at present , there is only one plugin available to add support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ iring mind ;
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in . with the option options next to the debu@@ gger , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . appears usually in the left Dock .
a view in which all half points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . appears usually at the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown . appears usually at the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , to listen to de@@ hydr@@ ations . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened by default , so it does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part to debu@@ gging session Star@@ ts the session . includes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the loop according to requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger output .
indicates the debu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and information on the monitored variables as well as the current line introduced to it . if this happens , while the script is continued , the execution will continue , before a debut requirement was started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the debu@@ gger with the execution of the script to send without information on monitored variables and the current line number , if this happens , while a script has been given , the execution starts out before a debut must be made , the execution starts as soon as a request is put .
the debu@@ gger leads the next directive in the script without having to enter into the functions or clu@@ ders .
the debu@@ gger leads the next directive in the script , whereby , if possible in functions and input of the debu@@ gger .
points the debu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next as if there were the current not .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable screen .
this dialog can enter an variable or set a new value of variable variable .

this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to suit your needs and like you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; help get better .
document type Edi@@ tions package ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; to provide your simplicity and flexibility . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and the toolbar . tag folder includes two data types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ ging window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the shareholders ; for the day shows . the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . toolbar toolbar allow fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without risk of writing .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the cap@@ tion language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ 2 )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything concerning the possibilities and limitations is set forth in a simple way .
this is the root element of an ox document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains as only element type about yourself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script feature . when used is used , att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an exit @-@ attribute and the attributes within this tag may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of any tags . this item can only appear once for each attribute . it sets the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains additional tags , which should describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; this is a only element @-@ element .
gives the source selection used for the attributes of the tag in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; is used to at@@ taining the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ h ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a stroke and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % day@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a only element element .
defines the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur inside the selected tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that can finish a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly aligned and closed .
spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , particularly in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not cause a leg @-@ break but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog above is in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; -@@ window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is not yet available . at present , the verification only occurs during the load of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file covers the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file is described a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extension = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD ) ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simpl@@ est name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set the actions to set ... create . click New action leads to the same dialog :
this action weigh@@ ted keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simpl@@ est actions . the text can be entered into the detailed settings and in exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; even are the quick@@ start dialog or the various see ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified pl@@ ade allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir in the Command Line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file will be removed : / from the document name .
% P@@ ID : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only an instance is running , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; used by external script .
the parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods there can be a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; at the default input can be determined , which is intended to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually advisable only with this setting .
accordingly , the output can also be diver@@ ted from the application . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written on the default output . it can be specified regarding the default output written , by setting the value of the box output :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the right toolbar .
complete everything and if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use , activate the dialog &quot; tag , &quot; if available , so that an entry when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ or ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select graphics and programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change it , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a boot button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that An@@ no@@ des this symbol a &amp; lt ; start@@ up ; -@@ day in the current document will insert .
after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with setting actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field is one button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and continue using other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; functions to the toolbar or it should be dealt with in a better overview of some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the toolbar can be selected using settings toolbar . make sure the desired toolbar can be selected .
I want to select the cutting ( all left ) for my toolbar . after the selection of the item , which is to be added to the toolbar button , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want to preview the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note , how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my work service , might believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the right folder , but your work@@ top ( s ) should be saved in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar can be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the worth mentioning of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ docum@@ ent@@ ree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ checking that somebody has done this already for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second one we handle here .
# KDE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the docum@@ ent@@ ations HTML files = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ .@@ 3.@@ html pages = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html &gt; = Sunday 1,@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html - 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation in such a way :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html gear@@ box = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tactic .@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that the sub@@ folder is based in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess tel@@ ep@@ fe ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; resource @-@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ h ; resource @-@ files are replaced .
the table @-@ section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed to the design of the context @-@ text ; for example , if the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array -@@ function is to be displayed . by flag@@ ging the function name and sli@@ pping of C@@ trl ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connection lines .
an easy list of by means of separate context elements which are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web developers of the web platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the following resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar without promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . in different places there is a E @-@ mail menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication . in order to sign the resources , why there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when loading , you are asked for their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for its private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ p@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys , you can choose an exit . in the dialog &apos;s new resource ( URL Pre@@ view can be empty ) and click with clicking OK the Upload .
the up@@ loading can upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , which can upload tool toolbar , and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature . in the event of any problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages and the resource correctly signed , appears a message with the indication of the author &apos;s permission .
it is possible to work on XML languages , currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; supported to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in the day @-@ XML format . there is the simpl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD menu and Convert a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description which is to be used . after that , the following dialogue will be displayed :
target listed by : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition box : the string that will be in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / s@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
the fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; after conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; therefore , one must first become familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter attempts to teach them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ations ; little utility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; available , available . from the toolbar on actions is all that marked as a globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; it allows the group of administrators to ensure different work@@ places , actions and patterns in the global tree , which can then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements are a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and toolbar toolbar . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be done all by &amp; CSS ; patterns up to work toolbar specifically for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bedding a common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the Bau@@ man@@ views , the boxes with information and the toolbar . please fill in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the map of the map with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document pass@@ codes , to load , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ area lead to an additional context menu regarding the processed document contents , such as fundamental processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing of under the mouse pointer of the mouse , help to the word under the mouse @-@ cursor or open the file , when the string is marked under the mouse pointer of a file .
at the top of the Editor &apos;s toolbar you find the toolbar toolbar . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard to which a set of toolbar bla@@ sts is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and the related user needs .
the use of toolbar toolbar is really easy . if they want to insert it into their document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert it one day that has several attributes ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to open and navigate to the information , navigate them and strip . in the presentation with cart@@ els are available for files , project , sample templates , scripts , attributes , and documentation Bau@@ man@@ views .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; provides . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of right mouse @-@ click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be performed with the attached context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web page &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more on templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script via the right mouse button , such as the script to start , edit or send by email .
with this view one indicates the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the cursor , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right clicking an element , a list of commands are opening in terms of navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other building views . with it , you can change certain attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . that allows to change all of the available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ar ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be customized and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; two cart@@ els at the bottom of the window will be reached on the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map showing information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . so , for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD .

the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; toolbar toolbar can be extended and easy to understand . indicate a symbol and they get the appropriate command shown . the chocolate toolbar of the toolbar is the possibility of defining their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; sends the toolbar as a compres@@ sor @-@ archive through e @-@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar at an E@@ mail , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; like any other , and invite you !
it is reasonable as you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ files on your system . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help one . the options are easy to understand and here are not executed .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool optimized for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; was optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; a peculi@@ ar , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up @-@ Language Editor ? well , this would make him the absolute greatest Web @-@ development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; well , is already standing on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . it can be defined in &amp; XML ; then you should define &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ; for this purpose .
now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; KDE ; Developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; -@@ smells is not only all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows web developers the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and toolbar , automation is possible to remember almost any task . through the program comm@@ its you can remember &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; connected . the original developers completed the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a fast access list of files you have opened . this list changes each time when you open a file that is not placed on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . have a look at the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project system &apos;s system , there is only one error reported .
converted when inser@@ ting out the clip@@ board there special characters to the &amp; HTML , delay , so that they are displayed correctly and are not understood by the browser as form@@ atting guide .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; writing , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
turn the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages can be ordered !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions in order to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window , in which you see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .

displays the toolbar icons on the left of the main window . this column allows you to put Book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when reading the book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ projects are stored with file @ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files are then copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory after new files that could be there . this enables to copy e.g. graphic files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; from and if you have any additional input / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects can be explained in detail .
loads a project toolbar . these are kept in proj@@ ector / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you assigned it to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved through settings . your toolbar can be stored on the toolbar toolbar or you are asked if you want to save the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from hard disk . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar button , you will be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send your own toolbar at someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; -@@ team to make the toolbar at the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server , where everyone can access it .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; its own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when the entities will be fin@@ alist off the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this global ist and a sp@@ elling has not exist in the global KDE folder , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the relevant toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar toolbar , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / promotions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; the inser@@ tion by means toolbar can be contradi@@ cted by the rules if this day is contradi@@ cted to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plugins are listed under the above menu items . click on them . click on any of the activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
sel@@ ects the syn@@ thes@@ ized mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ ates ; -@@ version starting .

checks the syntax of the current document using selected &amp; D@@ TD ; tidy by means of the external application .
immediate switch between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the switching sometimes or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card box mode , which is also the default setting mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains a entry for each open sub@@ window entry . with selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog cures any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browsers .
judge the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ar . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog will appear where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can change and follow the sequences .
this should generate an aid according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; development in financial form , find them here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , as for example after filling the project to complete the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift , F@@ 7 project Project properties .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ ho@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can see the server address of the machine , which you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ ep@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment may be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder will be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the toolbar toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects , this folder will be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you have static web@@ content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ based scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) one needs to proceed differently .
def@@ ences , if files are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be integrated . if a project is started from scratch , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option displays all files and folders within the main menu and you can make a precise selection of your vou@@ chers .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , from removing the hooks , cl@@ inging from the project .
the last screen of the new Project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project Properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or using the keyboard short@@ cut down ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are completely ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project @-@ folders .
supple@@ mental option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project . it can be read more about project views .
in this way , the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Debug@@ ger plugin can be configured with the button Options . in the debu@@ gger , the debu@@ gging interface can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles you can upload up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a sub @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , by displaying an own construction @-@ view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window event , one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul opens ; the last project that was open . this behavior can not be influenced by default .
to open another project , select the project ... from the menu project or the icon project opening out of the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project management provides free access to the files in the project . you can manage the files in the current project .
folder is also used , however , the entries are missing and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more of a profile is available , the button will be ab@@ ed to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the kernel memory and forget the program . this option is useful if common loading of files is necessary and that the rather in@@ secure password on the disk is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to several servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog displays :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
the trans@@ fer@@ mentation protocol for the high @-@ load . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your att@@ ach@@ shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but anyone with programming can easily see in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and toolbar toolbar . it can be done in a project of many views , that is , by simple exchange of view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar .
opinions can be stored in the menu Project or the Project toolbar , accessible via settings on the toolbar toolbar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; to the own working method .
as already mentioned above are toolbar bla@@ sting in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; best from the toolbar toolbar . usage and add is dealt with . adding the toolbar at the bottom of the toolbar toolbar .
the toolbar can be configured either via context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be executed , or the toolbar can be executed , which can be displayed in dialogue , where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar toolbar , the entries will be removed and displayed action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar ... and set settings .. set .
templates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ ette , code engra@@ ving and files to the link@@ ages . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; used templates basically like a nasty file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or each at the system existing in the deposit box . assists in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; in about the restrictions you set up for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ pointing ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template in front of the usage precisely .
land@@ fill is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using link@@ ages ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the Templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text file type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are s@@ ulated in appropriate sub@@ folders on basis . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text range always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the basic @-@ tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , folded in a zi@@ pped tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tation .
create a document structure after expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose file as a template to save as a local template ....
once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . look at the default tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click Save File As a template to store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily pulled by dra@@ gging and dra@@ fting to the construction management templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only to copy in a default folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dra@@ fting or paste across the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in project files to create a folder template , select a name for the template and backup . by default it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be as local or global template .
project templates allow for a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically with PHP ; shapes , paste files or link with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the default structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / apps / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of vessels as described above .
to set the behavior of a folder in the default overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu Properties . the following dialog will appear :
a selection panel with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as per@@ ter@@ ous attributes is attached .
this is enabled by default and fits all besides the master folders in the default overview . if a master sub@@ folder would dis@@ abling it , it would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder would the bla@@ h would appear with something like text tree . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder .
allows you set up or set text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of summar@@ ies in a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; - Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Editor &apos;s text editor that can be reached via the menu View . the first mode replaced the text text editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor is released . then you can edit and edit the source code editor , where the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; editor in source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor to a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ adverti@@ ser of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; however , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode is just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be synchronized with the cursor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be active , this mode is already active , the touch of the active cursor from one window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization spac@@ ing between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code Editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ view one can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be set in addition to the time of time . basically the recommendation applies : a small det@@ ector for quick calcul@@ ators and a large mag@@ net for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , tools is possible to choose document properties . this is also called the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is also called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be created . this serves to change the result :
meta tags , the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list enables the modification of the content , e.g. keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported at this time .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selected the corresponding file .
the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is as in a text processing , possible through because with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted via typ@@ ing , typ@@ ing sw@@ amp or extension .
the inser@@ ting of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar button , like in the source code editor . it is noted that the inser@@ ting of tags previously available already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor day , is inserted with text , every other converted anchor needs to be removed .
some work boxes like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for study of style templates . in contrast to other programs for style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be prosec@@ uted .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successful compile , need except &amp; KDE ; still the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; KDE ; already available .

there are many graphic tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the con@@ duction was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ory had made many changes and at the same time had corrected one thing in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . the interaction of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs . later , more useful functions were added .
if you want to compare fast text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ isons window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way interaction will be fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot will display three Qu@@ ell files in the compilation :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this scre@@ enshot will show &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; at the folder interaction :
&amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and control the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check co@@ ding , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines are only different in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble when someone changes the balance . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself ease of animal work by simply writing the fil@@ ename of the first file completely . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 3 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder
opening dialog enables the manual in@@ type file name , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the list . open dialog displays your selection and displays it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparing or con@@ mer@@ ging of folders will be introduced . if for A file is selected , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
when we merge together , the input field is active for the purpose and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can also carry this step later in the store .
the set @-@ up button will open a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the comparing / collapse .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . the comparison will then immediately start . in open dialog you will need to select no files you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel &apos; button .
you can also drag and drop files : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window .
which thought lies behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to load only two relevant files , put them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present you cannot draw nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparative window will be supported .
warning : some editors may interpret the draw and paste text into another program to cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window there is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ &apos;s Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source boxes are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the colour which file differs . if both files are different , the pres@@ et color is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
links next to the text is the summar@@ ies column . when differences were found , the color indicates the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs are relevant only in strings and comments , for the Pre@@ vention and in a few , rare items . )
the vertical line , which divi@@ des the abstr@@ acts column from the text , is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no line . if the default file is activated , the line is shown on the converted lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ isons ) has also a Info line with the wording output : the file name and &#91; changed &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually it contains the automatic assemb@@ ling already text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the storing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the closest hard@@ est / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference can also be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be indicated , where the group will otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left is a black beams .
sometimes by automatic assemb@@ ling or by manual editing no further line will be left in the group ; then it &apos;s only a space @-@ card for the event that you can change your opinion and maybe do another source . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; rec@@ alling code conflic@@ ting ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . keep careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comment , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly with the keyboard and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard on the right , right , high , down , side , side , bottom , bottom , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g @-@ end , Si@@ w as well as you can also use it from other programs .
at the exterior window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the paste button you can switch between plug @-@ in and over@@ mode mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns you will sync the view of all windows to the top of each group ( as already in the section summar@@ izing and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be solved between solved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ inser@@ tion ) . however , this option is automatically copy , what ever you mark to automatically copy into the clip@@ board and the manual Copy . be careful because you might not be able to over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ during are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants are using a sel@@ ectable layer \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car turn@@ around + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ schu@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 shall not use the read@@ ings of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved at the request and restored at the next start . ( Menu Ein@@ stell@@ ations@@ - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog displays also writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in cur@@ sive font . if the chosen script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure shape , but would be curved . on these systems the button pres@@ ets is automatically an un@@ treated color .
when this option is activated , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted at the pressing of the Tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a Tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you type or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual is then dropped into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files are trying &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines can be ignored in the source files . only during this first step can be ignored white signs . the second step is compar@@ es any line . in this step white signs cannot be ignored . also in co @-@ operation , white signs cannot be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon mark . \ &apos; at the end of a line , others need only a replacement ticket , but then they could be activated with different sizes in the side @-@ side comparison , although they may vary . when this option is activated , you will be disabled , but as a white signs may be disabled . in default , this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) . in the result the differences are displayed nevertheless , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white signs .
intensive searching for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective at complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the auto @-@ step mode , this setting will determine how long the outcome of the selection is shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued .
solving automatic all conflicts in white signs using selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs in many files are less important . note that the automatic selection also applies to numbers in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ant C / C + + -@@ comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter for scanning of folders and performing a co @-@ operation . see for details of documentation on the directory comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is called Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ id exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you have to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit , and restart it , so that the change is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is employed globally across the control center . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , for all entries the upper setting is used .
about the com@@ mon@@ ds for enco@@ ding appears a short reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character . )
customize the file co@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted as enco@@ ding . as enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
when you have processed a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can set the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing command .
turn off this to supp@@ ress the high@@ lighting of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ view@@ points . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colored @-@ coded transfer column . but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files . depending on selecting A &amp; B ; B , A &amp; B &amp; B ; C ; C is shown next to the normal still a second super@@ sti@@ le column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
orders the compar@@ isons by side or over @-@ each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts to merge the merge and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as the pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart it , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
while reading a file it is passed on to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible and not the file itself . you can write your own em@@ processor that corresponds precisely to your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the reverse .
while reading a file it is handed over to this external command ( see above ) , then the command of the command will only be used with the compensation command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds precisely to your requirements . each input line must have an associated output line .
the thought behind this is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program themselves it . the good news is , however , that in most cases or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this precau@@ tionary sub@@ commands to transform the input into big letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; s . * \ \ &apos; is based on the found text in the first gear string . \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in big letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords in order to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command of suitable . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every following suitable matches will be replaced , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ ments at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ ments from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / Switch &apos; For the per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the default &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal user @-@ processor will be kept for the display and to the operation . further operations only alter the data that sees the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , when you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off @-@ processor sees the output of normal Pre@@ par@@ ates as input .
the em@@ bank@@ ment commands are very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can &apos;t notice certain differences but cannot destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers in a folder need to edit many files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders re@@ pres@@ sive and merge together .
... makes a suggestion for every object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the assemb@@ ling and displays the sim@@ ulated changes , without doing it really ,
... exec@@ utes selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merge individual files . you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be merged , folder @-@ 1 will be used as the basis . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder @-@ 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start working together , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder will inform you a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed by then .
when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can double @-@ click on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub @-@ directories and sub@@ folders with which you can split up all folders and folders .
when you double click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the cl@@ adding action will not be automatically selected . if the interaction result will be started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
at identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders will be considered as identical if its entire content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders the age is im@@ significant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf back , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B file is ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the co@@ existence can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B file is ) : error : contradi@@ ct@@ ory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the co@@ existence can not be started .
the mode for synchron@@ isation is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical to the two folder . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; right after the merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of assemb@@ ling ( uns@@ afe ) activated , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the current date , then the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , the merge the folder can not be started .
during the mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . you state column shows he@@ ather when the co@@ existence was successful , and according to other reports , if something un@@ expect@@ edly appeared . when the co@@ ding is finished , you should check out a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the furniture dialog the file is selected Full analysis , K@@ diffusion 3 further columns will display . these include the number of par@@ ables , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dering conflicts will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the straight selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all together @-@ one actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start together .
please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C will be used as target folder and Synchron@@ ization A and / or B as target target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory assemb@@ ling / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only perform the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if through conflic@@ ting data types still exists , a message appears to be pointing to the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options passing , sim@@ ulate and crash .
if you want to see , if you first want to see what would happen , without the really make changes . you will then get a detailed list of all promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then results in certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window will pop up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are ready with a file , select directory assemb@@ ling , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , appears a corresponding dialog . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry continues .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ user , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you choose to transfer it again ( F@@ 7 button ) , let &apos;s choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the result .
if some entries were individually merged , these entries ( in the current session ) and execute them at later execute all entries . even if the compilation has been translated or not saved , these entries will be considered settled . only when you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... ) now has a section called directory assemb@@ ling with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary @-@ tree . separate the samples with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid bases : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default configuration is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . a great advantage is that this folder is specifically configured with .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files are a ver@@ aging attribute . in other file systems marks a leading point . this option makes you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is enabled in the pres@@ et .
when left to files : when the option is off , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when left to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be examined and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder that would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) This option is off in default .
exec@@ uting a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ question@@ able , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they are applied to files containing no text . ( enter a similar Anti @-@ pattern ) .
when you compare large folder to a slow network , it is potentially faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ ist date and the file size . however , you will cost a certain degree of safety . please use caution . this option is in default .
similarly to the chan@@ gers date . there is no real comparison , if they are identical as identical . this can be useful for example when copying the change of change . please use caution . this option is in default .
activ@@ ates the syn@@ cing mode if two folder is to be compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be identical . also , the results of the mer@@ ging of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences instead of gathering the copying of the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets deleted . if an old backup file already exists with .@@ ori@@ g extension , this option is deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal assemb@@ ling of individual files , not just the assemb@@ ling . this option is switched on in the default setting .
usually , the folder abstr@@ actions can be visible to the assemb@@ ling of individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ ders with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the option directory and text window to switch the window on the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking it . nevertheless , in the directory menu , there is also a corresponding menu item . you can save a single file directly without having to merge the folder , and the file will not be done once again when you restart the folder .
this status will however be lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diffusion 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folder to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive of a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be observed :
a path can be relative und@@ oder . or .. These are not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol it used . it follows a short list of constraints :
or it can not be distinguished whether a link is shown to a file or a folder . then , a file will always be referred to as a link . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change the change from the original . ( note the option to the size of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main purpose of use is currently available as a difference in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences viewer . to launch K@@ lamp@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in K@@ lamp@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , the input file is a patch @-@ file in the Uni@@ fied format . then the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; diff@@ used 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part II . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . in addition , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the comparing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . all together or comparing folders will not be supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist are comp@@ are ) already . in addition , the name K@@ diffusion 3 already shows that it can result together as the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs for quite a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go it like that .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will not be the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in default , you will not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are being treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is treated differently , the line will be treated as not identical . if the other lines are next to each other , this is is the case that this is is the case .
the editor turns out for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is however lost when the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort is so far too big . you can restore a particular version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly wound ; no sr@@ c cylin@@ ders ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already use many colors to generate differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and fault @-@ reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need and KDE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diffusion 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest modifications in htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ use sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to use &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; KDE ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and fe@@ eder used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE ; mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking system .
only differences display : files identical in all folders are not identical in folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you must update to these options the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries indicated , the differences are shown . if the target folder does not already exist in the target folder , if the target folder does not already exist , they will be missing in a later program version . ) This option is off in default .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are hung out of the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) , if the lines are already present , they will be re@@ directed to the button in accordance with the button .
in setting , this option is disabled . underground differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , or to post@@ p@@ one it . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space areas as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other desktop areas .
the context menu is dependent on where the right mouse button is clicked on , then click on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , the icon and the name of the application , as well as minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On desktop and finishing . the commands bring the following :
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . it only appears when clicked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when clicked on an application .
is this junction box marked , you can move windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop areas .
if this field is tick@@ ed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual desktop areas are displayed .
crossing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers on virtual des@@ ktops . if the name is displayed together with name , the names associated with folders will be charged and eg . 1 .
when this field is tick@@ ed , the background of each desktop is also shown as a background in the p@@ ou@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is tick@@ ed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; classic window @-@ window will be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster appear , as made out of p@@ ager applications in some other windows ; orph@@ an@@ ke shows all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical series , which is very well suited for representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be altered in the size that the windows as symbols or content can display and move . besides , it runs outside the control panel .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and follow the switch to set up ... lets the dialog appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you do not have any des@@ ks for the file you need to log in as user root or log in to your system administrator . this file must register the keys wind@@ ow@@ ls mode and assign this value . possible values are :
as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of the KDE package .

&amp; Wh@@ ey ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; kiss ; a part of the screen is like you can use a lens for the small printed or the exact amount of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; cut@@ ters ;
&amp; Wh@@ ey ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimised for use on weak computers .
if you prefer , a window appears as shown above . the main window by &amp; k@@ likes ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fier window .. The image that is shown in enlar@@ ging window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , the area around the mouse pointer as a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; kiss ; in addition , you can create a selected screen range in the magni@@ fier window ( selection window mode ) or the en@@ vir@@ ons of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the setting mouse @-@ cursor . please note that this is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection panel to your needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mo@@ sten ones and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse pointer in the enlar@@ ging window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the content of the enlarge window and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; Wh@@ ey ; has a lot of functions . you can save the enlarged picture directly to the printer to paste into a file into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , the picture turn and much more .
starts or stops updating the display . the actu@@ stops of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , low , means , high @-@ high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be shown in a window .
&amp; Wh@@ ey ; uses automatically your lod@@ ged short command to store files , opening a new window , prints , no@@ un@@ ads ( with the button document again load in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and cr@@ ushing &amp; etc ; .
k@@ ine also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen cap@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; for this purpose you can use a lens to view the small printed in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artist to the Web@@ designer or visual handic@@ apped .
detailed user @-@ documentation can be found with help : / k@@ likes ( specify either this URL in the address bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ help@@ desk help : / k@@ likes ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse pointer is a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who pose sor@@ ns in an in@@ action ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ clicking pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arise at the clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the simple terms of the mouse , you may apply to pain that is related to using your computer , if this is not yet done .
to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the account of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result may vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse @-@ click , once you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent ver@@ ge is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause , after it will push the button of the mouse button . move the mouse over until the end of the movement , before the release of the mouse button will run . in this way , you can run the pulling button on pressing mouse button . the intelligent sho@@ eing requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this ha@@ ste must be du@@ ly after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is smar@@ ter reloc@@ ate switched on , the turning point is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button wa@@ its before it starts the mouse button again , if there is no use of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow cycle saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt . it will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt for the first time , but it can be started later .
when the sound appears to be delayed , you can shor@@ ten their reaction times , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can decrease to a lower value to shor@@ ten the score .
is this setting marked , is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; available at every start from &amp; KDE ; this function is currently only available under &amp; KDE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to launch a program .
set all settings on the values back when opening the dialog box . have already pushed the button down , the settings will be applied to the state after the last pressing process .
the best use you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with preference . in particular , the intelligent Ver@@ push you should start off first . if you then click u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later use the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the ant@@ amount of &amp; KDE ; if you need to decrease sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window which does not display a link leads not to un@@ paid reactions . therefore you can park the mouse on these places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse buttons , you should clean@@ se your mouse . that is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse button but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse .
first , you need to take the mouse button . as this happens , from mouse to mouse will vary . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can be easily scr@@ ap@@ ed with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a failure is started . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent Ver@@ push , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means , the operation is no longer able to quit the release of the mouse .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use in another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse @-@ click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; reset and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , tries &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and moves the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over there , where you want to have it . but if you don &apos;t want to make your mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you are uns@@ ett@@ led reactions . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor is in@@ cum@@ ulative ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows .
I &apos;m trying to work with the intelligent di@@ p@@ one , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent ver@@ p@@ one is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very comfortable possible to copy and paste it into the clip@@ board or run any other action you want to move the mouse on pressing mouse button . but there will probably be some problems for you :
don &apos;t use the intelligent touch if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead , execute the Shift key , while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again instru@@ mental the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . this becomes every@@ time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when when the intelligent Ver@@ g starts the delay time . later you can use the smart t@@ anning also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; installed . this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; inserts the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ dened . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and those whose secrets of the mouth is being prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; also can be configured to be configured , that there is a certain time waiting for a certain time before the mouse button gets dropped . in this way , the dra@@ gging and dra@@ fting can also be done using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows the mu@@ te user to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; the user can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list with the discussion process phrases which are to be talked again .
on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the layout .
on the second page you can choose the default Cou@@ ch@@ book . from the text pass@@ codes you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the passages may of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can assign the wording of a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only spell words can be recorded in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an entry field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the bottom white box in the scre@@ enshot ) and a process memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white box in the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you have k@@ mouth ; properly addressed , you can input the propositions you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the reference memory . you can select from these propositions which are to be talked again .
using the menu item Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and attitudes , the side of Wor@@ th@@ er and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the card output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the text box you set the enco@@ ding solid , with the text transmitted to the language generator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass on the text . select the link field when the text is left unchanged as standard input to the voice generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the tick@@ eting box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command depends on the language version of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as possible knowledge as a language service is used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
in the first selection field action after the selection of a text string , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a textbook in the menu text password books or in the bar for text@@ books .
with the selection of so@@ fter the selected text product is directly spoken and inserted in addition to the command &apos;s memory . using the selection of In the input field , the chosen text is initially entered only into the input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the second selection panel , you can specify , whether the text @-@ book @-@ book of the processing of the machining process should be automatically saved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the selection of text@@ line diary , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text book @-@ book is not saved . select Save As Save , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text book is to be saved .
the side of the vocabulary list contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the words field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this box you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
using the buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them to a file . below the list you can adjust the name and drop the language for the dictionary .
choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; also reads the &amp; KDE ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words will simply be determined by number of occurrence . in addition , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only proper written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; queries then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re @-@ entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ codes is divided into two . in the upper part , the text @-@ coming books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected record . if you have selected a text file , you can change the text string or the per@@ tin@@ ent scanning process . if you choose a text book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books you can either delete over the selection from the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a fold menu .
you can change the order of text pass@@ codes or text passages by drag the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut and copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this will otherwise be used , otherwise the selected areas of the process .
the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this will otherwise be used , otherwise the selected areas of the process .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , this will be used , otherwise the selected sent@@ ences of the unit .
this menu item is crossed by default with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar toolbar can be displayed directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the clever wing page and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is tick@@ ed , a narrow flow@@ ed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not marked , this status bar has been hidden .
this menu entry is crossed by default via the editing window . the bar is displayed by default on the editing window directly under the toolbar toolbar . by mouse click on the clever wing page and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not typ@@ ed the command for voice output correctly or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for more details . )
festival is a language version of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and further information without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / Festival . the command to the language version is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and further distribute them without any limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS has been installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . the language version is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to comp@@ ress the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text at Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ lowed the last character of the text , so an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ F _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data should be switched on as standard input .
the voice output D@@ äm@@ on from &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ continued voice service available to all &amp; KDE ; application uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is only carried out in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a scrip@@ ting service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup the page K@@ TT@@ SD speech , which is in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t talk to release text through the computer . there will be a list of already rehear@@ sed propositions which can give the user again and again .
notice that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer must be installed a syn@@ thesizer .

&amp; kt@@ own ; - the voice output system of &amp; KDE ; - is a result of modules of existing service that allows every application to read text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface
&amp; amp ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; KDE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it represents a common application interface for &amp; KDE ; -@@ programmers ready to be equipped with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . also the users offers it interesting possibilities .
reading of texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; , even if &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; KDE ; applications is embedded .
the voice output takes place via the program Spe@@ ech branch , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; used .
enables the creation of language links on the command line ( or with shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , s@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ mark@@ up meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ own ; you must install and adjust program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the map card is also displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices so also different male or female , or those that are defined in volume or speed . you can also set out several variations for syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a spokes@@ person before you &amp; desktop ; use , as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple pressure booster for the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ cart@@ on spokes@@ person in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r , the card card is displayed . this will also automatically appears when you start reading t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and yet no present@@ er is set up .
all present@@ able speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application has no present@@ er .
select a present@@ er from the list and click on this button to remove the present@@ er from the list .
simply select a spokes@@ person from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
simply select a spokes@@ man from the list and click on this button to push the present@@ er in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; desktop ; -@@ system .
choose a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as an Jun@@ gen@@ - and gir@@ ly voice .
when you click here appears on the new speaker at the map Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ a ; already almost use . go back to the map controller and check if the T@@ TS @-@ Service is operated by &amp; KDE ; see . now you can use &amp; desktop ; use to create text presentations . click on the map card orders to create text orders and to admini@@ ster . see .
if you have at least one spokes@@ person set up , you can start the language version of &amp; KDE ; click on the map folder , to open this map card . here you can set some general options .
select this tick @-@ field to activate the &amp; desktop service . this starts successfully , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create text orders and read text orders . see . remove the marking , becomes K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; KDE ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ own ; further , provided that the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
is this tick @-@ field marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r appears in the system of the control panel , it disappears again when the default is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , break down , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE ; clip@@ board or open a text file for advance . you can also switch the present@@ er for a job .
click to apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages .
the card card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card folder and activate it to voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; desktop ; then select the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu item Tools . after a short time the language version should start .
it is almost always advisable to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , head@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text displayed . check first if &amp; desktop ; then select the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu item Tools text . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; KDE ; you informed about the events stipulated by you . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , you may set up a message when you notify your nickname in a IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ a , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; KDE ; program K@@ NO@@ tify , appears a menu entries in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ according to application .
filter for drawing system shut@@ down offer a good possibility in &amp; t@@ ect@@ ts ; wrong , stressed or faul@@ ty selected news . the file called k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you re@@ moves the tags b@@ r and b from the messages , the e @-@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be accepted in most cases as assumed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; ct@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filters , text is processed before he will be sent to the program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wrong words or abbreviations , to handle a suitable language and spokes@@ man , or to avoid certain def@@ ici@@ encies of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &apos; Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher is working with a text . &amp; kt@@ a ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the output of screen transm@@ itters has the highest priority . it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the instructions will be continued again .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these jobs will resume after issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you want to read a long text on a website , you can enter with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; KDE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you encounter from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that have text orders . text orders are meant for the edition of prolonged texts , which do not have special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are worked in queue , except the output of screen re@@ viewers . if an application sends the output of a screen controller , while &amp; kt@@ a ; just reading this issue , this issue will hold and ended .
first , you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen retri@@ eves . you will apply to normal warnings , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; KDE ; -@@ News .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . these parts can indicate either as words or as a regular expressions , provided by text or as regular expressions , which allow the use of chat @-@ motiv@@ ating messages like : - ) by text or for form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; b @-@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ T@@ former uses a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . within the scope of delivery of &amp; ct@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML contain .
with Interphone filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; desktop ; if you have set a female voice at an example , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these various filters has adjustable rules , which it is applied to a voice output . when the filter determines that its rules does not exist , there will be the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; notice is sent , it will be edited by all activated filters available on the page below . editing by the filters are in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this indicates the list of the furnished normal filters . the filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed the series from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will be shown below the following furniture dialog .
if you have a list of words or regular expressions , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern . these patterns shall be found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding sub@@ stitutes .
enter a name for your filter . this name you can choose any number , it must be distinguished only by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replace it in accordance with the string of the column . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the stated word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries are attached to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used if the spokes@@ person speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the C@@ trl key .
here is a value registered , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID @-@ run programs get started with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers , you must we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only have to input .
the palette of the text filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box dict@@ ates filter when match . are all input fields blank , the filter is applied to all text .
when compared to words the colored filter controls regular expression in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) .
in this hand@@ book you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can call it in the di@@ alogs Ad@@ ding or Edit and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions are listed in the package .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ sions translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . however , the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the intercom filter , you can send texts to a certain spokes@@ person who is set up on the map link , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can specify the example that texts from a female voice should be read in .
before &amp; writing ; a text appears to the filter , it looks for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker of the text , the program highlighted , and the characteristics of the speakers sent on the map Spe@@ ech . with the speaker fast@@ en@@ ers , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
here is a value registered , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; expressions , you can access it with one click on the button to get help with the entry .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .

the voice output API , from &amp; KDE ; with the programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the syn@@ thesizer can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE labels ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; KDE ; . complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the KDE ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output across the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; KDE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; win ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands enter
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; -@@ window . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r in the other .
none of the above syn@@ thesizer support my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ tool filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so you need to do so if you don &apos;t use this voice to read on websites . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c installed and about the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or inter@@ sections appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so all propositions can be ski@@ pped or only gi@@ der@@ ry . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the code is adjusted to the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may possibly be remedi@@ ed by a colored filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on a command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ own ; for information that are not included in this guide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a adaptable module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; look for using another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , contact the developer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; developer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; transformation filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment from KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages c@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you can refer to the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code for k@@ de@@ cker , or downloaded all of the night recently created tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; D ; use , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the shut@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; Go ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; desktop ; which uses the program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g@@ r should be developed so developed that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text is comp@@ uted in individual sent@@ ences . the user can withdraw from the typ@@ ing - or administration , repeat the output or break down .
when applying text to &amp; desktop ; over there , they can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . so if you have created a speaker , the language English and its sex is female , this will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about it , how &amp; kt@@ a , select one present@@ er , check in after .
when you click Add to Add map Spe@@ aker at the map , then clicking a spokes@@ person on the list or click Edit , the card holder &apos;s speaker setup is shown . as an example , the module of the module for Festival Interactive is shown here . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable program . if the path is included at the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter a festival .
select the text enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; ct@@ ts ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally speaking , the Western languages ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you place volume , microphone speed and pitch of synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice you choose does not choose to .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load more seconds because of their size , those voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first sentence is syn@@ thes@@ ized compared to the start of K@@ TT@@ SD .
if this dialog box cannot be selected , you do not have yet set up a spokes@@ person ( or forget to apply ) . see .
is this tick @-@ field marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r in the program window , but not the program window appears after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
is this tick @-@ field marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD has a text read . in this way you have the possibility to read or use it in any other way .
here are all orders in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map Spe@@ aker .
with the buttons in this row , you can use sat@@ a in the order that is selected in the list below , pre - or go back . ( but not every order is made up of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) , and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is taken to the symbol in the system section . click on this icon to see the program window again .
if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here are only text presentations performed and ad@@ ministers . issues of screen retri@@ eves , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information on the communication types of &amp; ct@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , dict@@ ated &amp; kt@@ a ; either without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l compiled or t@@ ect@@ ts ; the necessary libraries cannot load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . do you have selected AL@@ SA , select here the PC@@ M device . see also
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal microphone speed . thus these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click on the application to apply the new settings for running &amp; desktop ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
in this map card you can set special promotions , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; B ; processes four types of language presentations :
the output of screen transm@@ itters has the highest priority . it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these assignments . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the checked orders are collected again .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these jobs will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read just a long text on a website , you can ride with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still meet someone who enters straight to the room .
will be a text order by a message , warning or the output of a screen controller , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played , when a normal text order is interrupted . if an introductory sound is active as well as the introductory message , the introductory sound is performed before the introductory message .
the settings on this card map apply only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and issues of screen re@@ viewers are no special promotions if this will be interrupted by a message with higher priority .
in order to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ tify messages to be read , start writing t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and click Al@@ erts . the card &apos;s messages will appear .
select this tick @-@ field to switch the pre @-@ read from &amp; KDE ; these settings are not marked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; h@@ ect@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications before .
is this setting marked , al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog displays in which you can choose the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the news before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname .
all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; ct@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; play ; do , when an event takes place . you have the following choices :
when you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired phone . standard cho@@ oses the speaker who is displayed in the list on the map link as the top item . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if a certain application has been set for a certain application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for any other events of the specific application . as the last chance the action is for carrying out the action under default ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . this allows you to specify the notification noti@@ fications as below :
use the button save to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button bar to load stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all disadvantage will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a language version . this standard includes labels for control of voices , the microphone speed , the volume , the voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation by abbreviations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; C ; SS@@ ML only supports partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you will need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the standard voice used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival file dialog not on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked dad B@@ r . who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Ba@@ r . who has slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ S filters ) . SB@@ Ds also submit text into individual sent@@ ences , as only the first sentence should be syn@@ thes@@ ized ; therefore , you can also cancel or stop the whole text order . this allows you to also cancel or cancel the map orders either directly or rec@@ ede , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the typ@@ ology filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ vision@@ ing filtering filter . you can alter its settings or add further per@@ tin@@ ent filter filters , but it will not be rec@@ essed with it .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the speakers by typ@@ ing . place the speaker selection once more . check the speakers again , change certain properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . for this , you must of course have more than one present@@ er , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ ect@@ ts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then faster to start reading , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will then be able to stop or cancel text orders on the map card , even if the syn@@ thesizer this function is not supported .
for these reasons , the normal per@@ tin@@ ent filter filter is automatically set up if you start working for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
characteristic filter filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a table character ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional part ( dec@@ imal characters are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard typ@@ ing filter filter will be included .
SB@@ D @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; News ( k@@ on ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ dres@@ ses .
if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal extension bor@@ dering filters , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the card side , you can over@@ write the speakers for the application . the map card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : there will be no inter@@ phone features .
the use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a furnished intercom . if you do not delete or edit the user &apos;s settings ; this spokes@@ person cho@@ oses . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the present@@ er , who corresponds to the most commonly asked properties .
select the method for entering the desired speakers , click on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , enter nothing .
mark this junction box when the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when stopping the issue , this property is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case , in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language , if you know that a certain application text is placed in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speaker , the closest to the following is to be deleted , click the button button , and then use Spe@@ aker , who is in the best to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last word order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I am no trac@@ e@@ ability .

the audi@@ o@@ output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; t@@ ect@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : Bel@@ to open PC@@ M .

I loaded an additional voice for music from the internet . I installed it and I can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r shows this voice not .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / Vo@@ ices / Vo@@ ices . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL that you found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program needs to be so@@ x installed and be noticeable over the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as festival Interactive offers an adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this function is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored , if &amp; D ; pres@@ et . ( that is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML format filter , and set the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage to be read on websites with a female voice . I created a female festival re@@ aker , but &amp; C ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE Gender does not work to function . so , the festival does not produce errors , re@@ jects the X@@ SL file to convert the SS@@ ML to S@@ but the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a specific palette of the filter , and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ a ; no more sat@@ a ) or go back . on the cart@@ on orders will be displayed , the order best before just one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( Point , Fra@@ ge@@ signs , expressions , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) do not allow you to filter . use this sign instead a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA &apos;s conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can not play music at the same time and start writing a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes also if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ own , the current set is still pres@@ et .

the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer will be created by default . some of them have a runtime of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Debian Distribution ) . the column configure option for switching the tag shows the configure parameters , which causes the adjustment of the setup .
as default , the folder is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify as the --@@ pre@@ fix = goal . for example
on Debian systems is / usr / local the right folder for programs , which are translated from sources .

before you &amp; h@@ our@@ t ; use , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions that you received with syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is manifested . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , microphone speed and pitch .
you must install at least one language . help to find in the instructions provided with festival . want to read this website , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice uses the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development @-@ stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . when you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ian ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution distri@@ butions . so look at the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be adjusted to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding needs to be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ically as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer . then the Festival assumes the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and mb@@ ro@@ la ; created from it the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete voice system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates language of di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which allows the administration of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings through a uniform , integrated finish . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed through the selection of K Menu Bar@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package has been developed to allow users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ monitor center ; to enable users to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choosing a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; menu bar .
it is important to understand that &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must have already been functioning and configured , so that &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all att@@ acking and setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in the installation of &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices are later added , the drivers have to be loaded according to the following files , according to the kernel version , will be loaded :
the module network settings is loaded , if the option is selected to set network settings in the &amp; @-@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network , this system is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be detected , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release population will be best . by mark@@ ing the setup non @-@ once @-@ queries the definition can be made permanently . the next start of network settings will then automatically set this option .
changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means , the settings can only be viewed , the Chang@@ ing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will proceed by clicking the button of the button . it is required by entering the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab Network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of button to set up the button and set up the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the button selected and displays the dialog with further possibilities .
using the selection Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore , no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , corresponding to the system to be selected .
by selecting manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP address must be made . in the input field , IP @-@ address must be specified by the TCP / IP address . in the input field , the sub@@ grid is set to set .
if this setting is highlighted , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values displayed in this dialog are displayed as qualities of the device in the device .
it should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . coupled with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need or switch off an integrated network device . it can be activated via selection from the list and clicking the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on your needs . switch off a activated net@@ work@@ station takes place by choosing from the list and clicking the interface to disable ....
sets the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected with the network , in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS backup is replaced by the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP adres@@ ses . if the machine calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ on@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS det@@ ects this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to create part of the rider list allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNA entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and up or gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority .
clicking the button Add ... from the group calculator to create a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add the dialog to the New Nam@@ as .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calculator on the nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click the Edit ... There will be the dialog box .
the list of specific calcul@@ ators describes calcul@@ ating machine @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with the boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list contains some known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still is still in the test to replace the version of IP set in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar calculator and then click Add .... The New alias dialog is displayed .
enter the name of the familiar calculator and the button Add . if the well @-@ known host has multiple alias names , press add several times and enter the other ali@@ ases name .
choose an entry of a named calculator from the list and select Edit ... the dialog with a message is displayed .
it may be done one of the following tasks , then clicking the button OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and in a console ; with rpm as follows :
an alternative tool can be used with graphic user like a package or an installation tool for your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and KDE ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other are needed .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about incorpor@@ ating the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 never found large distribution . by IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected to move through in the near future . thus , this description concentr@@ ates on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to point out which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact person who doesn &apos;t want a valid IP address , or if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when inser@@ ting an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from one specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address objects with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by hi@@ ring a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , the addresses are usually used in the domain of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks to 250 computers .
in addition , the m@@ mas@@ ke is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all other machine participants are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Zwe@@ ite the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for IP re@@ direc@@ ting .
the PS@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . usually the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this section the configuration files are shared by &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified at DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than fixed there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; D ; is a backup program for band@@ ages on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which set up the capacity of dd@@ le@@ 2@@ tar to the fast , selective extract . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes to be secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; quot ; it can be done in three ways :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldier &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he returns the band and reads the vol@@ tages of the bank . realize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognis@@ ing &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; the pro@@ voc@@ alist on the band do not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recognis@@ ing &amp; Wr@@ ite ; the Pre @-@ ann , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the band &apos;s work to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched by ex@@ cre@@ ing the item for the band .
before departure of the belt , first the integration must be solved initially . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a date ; by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the inclusion of the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a tape of &amp; a soldier , can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; quot ; form@@ atted .
one band@@ ing must be form@@ atted before you have to be used to store data . this process does not have to be form@@ atted in advance , that a tape must be form@@ atted in front of the use , it must happen . flo@@ ppy drives are usually put in a form@@ atting of the ban@@ des , DA@@ T drives on the other hand not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; b ; with the form@@ atting of the ban@@ anas . all the data on the tape are lost thereby ! after completion of the form , the volume becomes automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the securing files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select She@@ chem ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can examine even the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog displays backup . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in any of the files in the entry for the disk . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the check@@ up process was started , the dialog displays Settings for checking . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the desktop folder .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the test process and the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can import the restore , the files that are to be restored , this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives which belong to the belt work . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from any of the archives with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or a folder in any of the archives , and select Save ...
once the recovery process was started , the dialog will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the desktop folder .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will be re@@ producing . this dialog displays progress of the recovery process and the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the inde@@ x.@@ x file using the band &apos;s contents . this will del@@ etes all existing Inde@@ x@@ files for this band . you can re@@ generate the index on two types of the band :
this conclu@@ des a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings . you can make for a backup profile the following settings :
the current working folder in which the backup should be made . the list of securing files is updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , is that only those stored in it are stored on the same fil@@ esystem , as the folder . folder that are stored on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files are saved , which have since changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental backup is used .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all the files to be backed up and a new sn@@ ap file for the next backup will be created .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings may be made :
the complete path for the device file ( usually / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variation of the belt .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; date ; before the tape is included the command will load the load to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading and writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , trying &amp; b ; the exec@@ uting with the belt work to lock . possibly this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is enabled , when loos@@ ening the integration of &amp; c@@ eps ; automatically the tape is un@@ mounted . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy Stream@@ lines .
if the option is enabled , trying &amp; b ; the hard@@ ships support variable block@@ ages to change . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you will need to inform you &amp; a , in any case the block size for your band &apos;s work .
when &amp; D ; a band is form@@ atted it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should occupy only one block block on the tape . the content of the file is composed of as follows :
( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is billing : seconds , while calcul@@ ating the complete name of the system is , on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds , which has passed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ atted .
the Band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ date / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar @-@ versions should work as long as it is not concerned with incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup database . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; S@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ spect@@ ator for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; a system log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; S@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system log ; is an easy representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited in the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; a system log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions , which are fil@@ tered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a system , a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Samba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , provides &amp; sound@@ system log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , we tried to log @-@ log ; first , the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system Protocol - it will not display , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have a log file system . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no jus@@ tification for reading .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or to filter strings . the list of the log files will now automatically be displayed , so that only logs box contains the selected filter . in the default setting , the log box contains the filter for the selected filter . then a protocol is only displayed when one of the columns contain the character string of the filter .
you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , the fil@@ ename column appears in the appropriate column . for example , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so you &amp; k@@ fil@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a show@@ y color as protocol lines of stage hint . the colored presentation of protocol lines can be switched on dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar .
in addition , you can skip the option to new lines , in the context menu of the main window , to display all the new protocol lines .
&amp; S@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subjects . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on the display .
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more information on the sources of sources of &amp; k@@ system log ;
&amp; P@@ system@@ log ; in addition , you will find in the following folder of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : - System@@ log ; in and KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; KDE ; System V in@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; in this section a few concepts introduces and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V in@@ it quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program of running when running the system in the &amp; Linux , world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it system .
I will not go down here on historical aspects ( among others because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ der is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps anyone could try to make a machine on System V in@@ it without a re@@ install and reform@@ atting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ ner@@ it and the following more folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want when entering the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such matters such as set@@ serial that only once started . such Appe@@ als belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be done on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for this . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d when you want to run smoothly , what to do with the serial port .
the kernel will search in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre @-@ established Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you want to change it , then you come to repair , by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter it in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like :
you will notice that in this folder you find no right files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line in the following way :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; win ; a server Run@@ level , which lets only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; # ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; start .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not say trivial : just drag an entry from the area of Avail@@ able system@@ services on one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or adjust the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this happens when the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this does not happen if they draw an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area . to copy them only to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the edit menu or paste from the context menu and paste it into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service .
notice : currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( dispos@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one .
to move an entry in another Run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by pressing the entry button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise it will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n standard , and now the machine starts continuously . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for performing under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ ver ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without notice when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information on the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; c@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; c@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you must save this . either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry to be saved in the File menu .
&amp; c@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it will appear for the dialog user and group features .
some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only when you have advanced system settings , a card map will be produced on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d will be installed in BSD settings .
the card @-@ card password appears if shadow -@@ pass@@ codes or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD - Uni@@ xes are installed .
this card card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , although the space restrictions are specified in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system individually . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space @-@ restricted
the card card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which the user is heard , can be found in the field of primary group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by mark those in the great field .
the dialog properties tab contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the Add button &apos; button &apos; button . edit or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group will be analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time until the control of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify , change , change , and more .
