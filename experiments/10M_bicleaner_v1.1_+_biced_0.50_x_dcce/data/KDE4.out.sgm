<seg id="1">The module website can translate at the & Conqueror; menu under extras, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is part of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babyfish produced in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not be made on important decisions without reviewing the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the internet can be translated. other texts should you be translated on the babyfish page yourself where you can insert them into translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & Conqueror; despite its small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & Conqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & Conqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & Conqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Conqueror; select Settings. open the card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with standard configuration modules from KDE; addons. please note that there are more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, the & Conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Conqueror; on the extras. then you can see the page, the & Conqueror; for a crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module's module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & Conqueror; menu bar under extras). with the module you can filter & Conqueror; 's updated work directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM BaumanView in & Conqueror; use the DOM tree... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the document, example: documentate element, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; for a further view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of portrayed folders hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is separated by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can then easily be detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Trese-presentation, a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. easier navigation have the right-edge meaningful color and lettering.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle that is switched on color mode, can be either a depth for the easy detection of the screw stiff or picture of a different file editor, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature you can specify whether it is at all indicated, only when enough space to display is available or if the area of the subordinate rectangle are to occur (though, disappearing errors by restrictions on the character of the tread). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the captions in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps, the area should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Trese in & FSView; this aim is not always respected. it will be frame for the casing's entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As part of the area of an entry to the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to it. this is, it is necessary for the defaults and to avoid space losses due to the means that right angles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recursive cement.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal space for an entry over the menu entry view in the area. instead, a room pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for applying KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module photos can be found in the & Conqueror; -menu under extras-picture gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you access the module picture gallery, a dialogue opens with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture page in a text field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option pictures per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of minions each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the ticked box file name of the image, you decide whether the filenames below the mini-images are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the ticketing file size of the image, you determine whether the file size is displayed among the mini-images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the cross-box image size, you determine whether the size of images under the mini-images can be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In file selection, save in HTML file, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the cross-box subfolder, you can configure a slider or a screenplay until which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the Pictures, you can copy whether the original images are to be copied into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the Connections Commentary file you can use a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the cross-field of own color-depth, you can set for the mini-looking images to adjust another color-depth than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML module provides you with easy access to the general & HTML-settings for & Conqueror;</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in & digitization; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and each card reader, which is supported by your operating system, will work with & digitization; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with basic imaging tools. you can use it to review and correct your photos, to evaluate and correct. the editing capabilities may be easily expanded with KDE Image plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digipack is; easy to use, it provides receptive professional skills. it works complete in 16-bit color foam and all available modules support the raw converts by means of libraw, DNG export and ICC shades.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE; programs is also & digitised; an open source project. this means it is dependent on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitization; tries to make reporting of problems or improvements as easily as possible for them. if you are using this linkage menu, your web browser will open a page in the event report. all required information are already registered here. follow the instructions to submit your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitization; is a project which is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you have a regular user of & digitization; then you may already answer questions to other users of & digitization; and hopefully soon you have questions to other users. in this mailing list, you should be spoken in English language, so you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; home page to read news about shared versions and other information about & digitisation.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved & digitization; is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for contacting in the developer mailing list of & digitization;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you get & digitization; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder, or click the folder icon symbol to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the datasheets is stored. this path remains the same for all picture folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digitisone; you will also use as an Albenlibrary. Settings checks in the collections.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, which contains a base folder. & digitised; viewed any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the passing of the folder you will have a progress show as to see:</seg>
<seg id="68">& Whence came; thirsty the Bibliothectory in its entire depth. you can not lock any subfolders, unless it is iste in petrified folder. this allows you to insert extra-halbs & digitization; take a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist will have no photos as symbols. you can change the ones by taking any photo from the album and take this on the folder icon. more details on this can be found in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digitization; your digital camera set up. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and My catchlist to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Blanket support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it can also deal with it. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help resource support.</seg>
<seg id="72">As you set up this and work with raw files, it is described in paragraphs Roh-Decodes and Roh operations.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera body is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly in & digitization; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and each card reader, which is supported by your operating system, will work with & digitization; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for the actual transmission to the computer. the camera can then be realized as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& Control came; used the program gphoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gphoto2 is a free, extended software collection for digital cameras, which has a constantly increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to billing and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. as photos in general are large files and transfers via the serial port, this connection has now become obsolete. & digitization; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has been created with libexif support for it to read the thumbnails of digitisam. the EXIF support is not present in libgphoto2, you might have viewable images, or the generation might be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to be digitised, is how easy its functionality is to be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modal structure for & digitization;, kPhotographs, Shoes and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules of all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way, as there is also a user. your advantage is that it's much easier to supplement & digitization; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in & digicome; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page with & LMB; remove or switch in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Tightening and discard images everywhere: you can take a picture in a different part of the tree-tree, on the horizontal separation line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image does not contain in keywords, file list or browse.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection enables you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar. thus, the filtering is displayed on the filename only when this ind-window will also be displayed. which fields can be displayed in the dialog box settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; introduces a organized view to your photo albums. all photos, which were developed by & digitization; these albums can be stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created, sorted out. the date can be changed in the features of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose an album Import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. choose an album Imported screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with your mouse on the target album and drop it. in the then you'll have to select whether the image is moving from moving or copying. simply select all photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allowing you to access information about this collection. to access the album features, you must click with the right mouse button on the album and edit in the context menu entries.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to highlight your albums, so that you can select your photos under a common name. if you choose from collection, select or delete albums from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with viewing albums at the date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Knitting Eltester, average, New Year: these put the date on the one's oldest, the latest image or the passage of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first enter an album in & digipack; it will be the first image in the album as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected to help you to record the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select a different photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button, and select in the context menu & quot; as an album preview, you can choose the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitization; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field of My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have another effect. on the collection includes always all photos of the album. of course you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window introduces you to the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed on this album in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of these curtains with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait short while the thumbnails will be generated. this can be avoided in which you can create extras all the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. which information is, you can edit via settings; set up here the albums page and adjust the range of thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails will have help of help. if you want to rest the mouse cursor a moment across an image. the help displays the most important characteristics including all tags of a photo. the screenshot is shown above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a Help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all what it's about & digitization; goes. albums and keywords allow you to organize your photos as it suits you. you can view all the functions that come with & digitization; possible, through the context menu of the preview, or the menu picture in the menu bar. you can choose between the image of the pictures, a slideshow or editing of images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the picture editing with a photo by entering into either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit... select a guide on how to edit your photos. using the image processing you can view your photos and edit them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digitization; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the context menu with the right mouse button. the application listed there will be controlled by the & KDE; file regulations for the data type, you will find information in the & KDE; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing through other image processing programs can come to problems with the picture contained in the picture. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. by doing so, this information is lost out of the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitization: two options available for rotation. the easiest option is to click the Preview and Folder. in the submenu, you can indicate the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep enlargement (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you get a photo from & digipack; erase, it will be moved into the dustbin of & KDE; f8 image deletion or discharf if you prefer really deleting, you can use this by using Shift; Entf using Shift.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslidesquot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digitised; used to either be the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photographs of this month will be shown in the screen view. you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the file view, so that only the photos of the selected days are shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize your photos and be cataloise. keywords are stickers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword was assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos, which were marked with this keyword, are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. thus, you can also organize parts of the Tree & quot; My keyword seperately, so that you can find the keywords that you are looking for, easily find.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weighted catarword in the IPTC data areas of the picture, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. besides, the keywords in the loss of the database re-imported as soon as & digitization; the images noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keywords are quot; or click on an existing keywords, after you have clicked on an existing keyword, then this is the sole word for this keyword.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata are available in accordance with your definition data, which will provide information on or documentation of other data that may be managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even need to find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos do you have, then you don't even use it & digitization;. the approach will save the metadata in a database as well as in image files, very quick search and secure archiving for you to access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you need anything in your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to data structure. you have to decide whether other access to your photos may have to store if you want to save it to a reserved drive or at a network drives & etc; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly through your location. if you were in a year several times at the same place. the remaining photos will organise using your data. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant immigration of pictures on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years you will have 95% archives and 5% working files and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking tables easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a descended image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store metadata in & digitization. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget it, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the respective point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database but what happens when you want to change? to adjust & digitization; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now need any photo keywords, signages and an evaluation. of course, you can select all images, which will need the same attribute and then hit the value. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now proceed with keywords, keywords as you are often called by other programs or category. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloguzed images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree will insert the right place for you. the sort of hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub-tree on another. the changed keywords are tracked by & digitised; updated while it tracks the undermines.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata changes. this is a very rough representation, since each block contains metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data features all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool for storing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want most anyone to let your photos just see, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after the landing is. WOW! you start to dream of dreaming, memories, the historical time span is present again, you might even hear the stillness. so the lettering has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the image to create an interest. if you have pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key it is the importance to the observer to help Him through the motive that you moves has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for himself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can save as much text, in an international alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. you can even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE can even tell you a spellchecker. you will need to tell the story no second time after your wishes into the capitalization and / or title of the web gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it the earth not a boring planet before Google Earth? good, because with pictures the move of spatial presentation now already starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of the Geolocalisation take advantage of already innumerable and will soon be able to open it. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can start your travel virtually. you can also export the photos at the entrance. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright to share restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for producer and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to use the identity of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organisation may be used. after that value, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for publishers): associated with the author. this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples of this can be titles as: a photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author-field, this field must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonymous for provider): use the provider area to identify who is the photo offers. this does not necessarily mean the author. if the photographer is listed here for a message agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a camp photo, then the group / agency will provide the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this has no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the solution for this problem are digital watermark. for individuals, this is especially important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros this protection is very important to this protection against it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image unique. & digitization; will provide such a module for stacking data in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: record error, disk loss, rapids, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster, temperature, temperature, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we are not talking about CDs that are lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which cause a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated as cautious and one should not dare to you longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course, there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & pie; 2 this piece is one lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your Ermessenger room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can store good discs and good recording devices and they are not significantly more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it is about choosing the right to choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to error, even if you are just first written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection they need through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For broken CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that apparently causes wonders to CDs and DVDs. it also runs under Windows and Linux; but there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged floppies, hard disks, flash drives, USB drives, etc. read more.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the Formatte war against the HD DVD. a dual Layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost hexagonal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies for the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good loquiver on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. if you want to store the media with a description, date & author. please do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides for this topic a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard disks: dismissal</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold on the longest when you run in the Temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. with lower temperament, the fault rate dramatically increased. some of SMART determined errors announce the immediate forthcoming failure. these are particularly lesefehler and defaults. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also backup data loss due to an electric case before you have secured the files but these losses normally can be produced without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices does not matter much, this can cause serious harm to devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware switch, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity tops is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed some of the energy-heat and the rest is grounded. it is usually available in the form of a plug-box. keep in mind that not any plug-bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting the flash, and therefore protecting the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable connected to your computer, you should be sure that also all the peripherals can be connected to your system. this also applies to phone pipelines and cable drivers as well. others offer connectivity options for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection of your system will protect your system from smaller variations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete loss. even an decay of few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a underground-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically supply battery power. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the life time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Raise the potential risk, which your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety in power malfunctions with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you think how well your computer will protect it. at the end, you should always remember all cables before going to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared with the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the relatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and photo-Community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. the professional variant will not be available to you in full resolution. the professional variant will not provide you with unlimited memory, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unrestricted memory, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are processed automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and in large companies is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory. so they are desasterous.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the machine. all transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs pose at least the data integrity of operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission errors occurred to you, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered so that there should be no protection to your computer. nobody seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the inside your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as it produce interferencing within the data streams. with normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle records in low levels and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will be available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms the ZFS is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the Notebook and 46% in desktop systems. for notebooks, the share of the theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of them think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, itineraries, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process in a sudden stop during operation is higher and an indefinately status will be avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, robbery and human mistakes are the main cause of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras from digital cameras are removed 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and roughness of all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 Megapixelsensorial. even if this resolution has been too high for compact cameras and high quality optics, the Optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive you get today for 100 & euro; so do you make no other loss for data loss. so do you save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, exchange of plates or size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a strokes you will get lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. forget airbonding: fire, water, electricity, children and robbery are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">So desastervores means getting a not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is a further benefit of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for loss of loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files is to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference Protection: a backup of the files has been changed since the last complete backup. create a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the final difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup. create multiple times. you can restore the original status at any time when such backup comes up. this backup comes from a versioning system next to the exception that is only secluded and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer-scripts, rsync only the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other visual medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come up for backup however with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. each additional thinner should take place manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, original XMP files, original, memory, scalability, Media, regressed images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unpredictable because of your nature you have to look at caution and rate anew while the time passes. unfortunately, there is no other possibility as a certain vigilance. however, you should ask yourself how the current system is compatible with you. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easily it is the questions of the future to evaluate.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered from the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays for anyone available. so if you have an old system that's important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check out your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the trade fair for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually always expanding.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's take advantage of how you have built the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them off.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdb; # works with ext2, fatal 16, 32 and travelling time; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of motion if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software there can be read, then you can create it. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard the GIF should replace it. however, it is a lot more. it is losses free, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG may have relative many administrative information but not as many as TIFF needed and has a slow compression. this format we would recommend to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF may store in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss of free compression (deflates). a problem is however, that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a lict-free and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provides for now and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon can also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in order to replace the & quot; Bildsible Metadata platformquot; -Technology of the 1990s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a identifier technology that allows users to insert their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer it from an original of your recording, mostly in the blank format, to archive. XMP fits, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, if you notice the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata communities and the DCMI communities, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, standard conferences and workshops, standard connections and informative efforts to achieve a broader acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera system, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finer processing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digitization; then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off in some circumstances from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them first into webgalleries, coding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digits. in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description how you can add photos, which you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import pictures to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digipack; to use it, connect them to the server, turn the camera on the scoreboard and turn them into. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it is trying to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for the file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays files and images stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not provide all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata displays the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer's registration, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitization; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection from All. this loads the photos not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the chosen one with the default settings of your KDE labels. once you have selected the photos, use the button to download and then download the chosen item. the button selected will be selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this is an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded by & digitised. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the showcase. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons all download or outchosen you will appear a dialog with which you can select the target album, shown in which the photos are sorted, displayed in section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After which you selected the target album, press OK, and & digipack; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at one time by deleting the button Delete. if you only wish to delete some, you have to select them first and delete them deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility of photos deleted from the camera. so, the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & KDE; so you should carefully check if you want to completely delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete it from the camera, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually reused after the photos deleted from the camera. this can be too double file names when you load photos of different picutes into the same album. therefore, it may be reasonable, the date and time when the picture was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and spitting the image and date-based submission. if you use this latter option, you automatically create one folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission opens three further options that are carried out before the pictures are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Autoridentity. if you choose this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF data in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you desire a different format format than the standard format, you can use for example in the editing field the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% S. switch the option date & time to add. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command line.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or if you spell it, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digipack; for a photo is used, shown below the name that the camera will be displayed in the preview. your settings to rename are stored and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitization; can use all information about orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download. not all cameras do this information. in the page header metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and when your camera does not provide this information, it leaves and digitised; the photo is extended in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the button "" "" button "" "" and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window. "" "</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera is provided information about the date on which the photo was made available, can create & digitised; this feature is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. all cameras do not provide this information. in the page sidebar, you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digitization; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change it, you need to switch this option. use the button folder-based subfolders at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the knob. select then uploading. the file selector dialog and KDE; appears in which you can select the files uploaded to the uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After choosing the image is done, asks & digipack; she, where the images are loaded too. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to load the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that is stated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link up a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone used an aircraft to shop an area by automatic recording of GPS data to cartographs. environmental planner, military, police offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can send a postcard to another & digitization; user who wants to locate the location of the photo, or simply document this aspect, it is good for storing the position of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data areas, such as the data in these fields come? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, through a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and finally via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS recipients. either as a module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPads AQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DCS Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or pspsbabel, but you need to store this information in gpx format because it is the only format that is supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the covered Coordinates that are created for example of maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road types. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitization; tries to give you much control over its workflows as possible. to access these settings, you need to adjust the Settings menu. set up dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons to the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">This action can be displayed on embedded preview, or start editing. you can set the behavior of & digitization; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains as shown below, the Standardised identity and copyright-related data. these data are automatically selected in the relevant IPTC data fields. in a database synchronisation this data is written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Car title is a synonym for renditions: this field should be the professional designation of the photographer. this can be as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description on the author, this field has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the state of the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is for a message agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency should be enumerated the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions store the data into the respective IPTC rim. it is achieved that the metadata are permanently included in the image and cannot be imported in the database itself; it contains other programs and can be imported in & digitization; will be imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Picks of picks (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments, which you can add to your photos, using the pictures included in the pictures. caution: with pictures, which have already been signalled, these are translated by & digitization; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button uploading right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The setting of the luminance of & digitization; can then be opened on this page to the default values. however, if you then enter the luminaire, these settings are turned on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better routing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the shown pictures. if you prefer a different color, you can choose them here. you can switch the toolbar without editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture. these colors will be specified here. in the picture process, this picture can be integrated with F10 and F11 and can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia on the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting PNG-compressing you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, as PNG is using a loss-free algorithm. if you have a quick calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can compress the deflates -compressbag m for TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the deflate algorithm makes losses free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the hiring of losses-free JPEG files you can save losses free. even if you choose the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata were not yet supported, but still in the planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digitization; the picture editing was just a picture-picture for photos. currently, it is quickly developed into a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default gain is that all green pixels are the same. if the adline green pixels of the CCD-sensor in the output. if you use this option, this problem creates a little soft, eliminates this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates but the 2x2 Gellpatterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white balance is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the whiteboard is not placed. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported by Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the larder, so the parts of your images are mounted on, because of the incapacity of your camera to capture the smoklichter in the settings. the setting colors will generate some fancy results, as it displays the spike in various roars. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast puzzling such as green and red. & digigal, therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red spots from the remaining blue pixels of the remaining blue pixels. of course this is a matter of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select option reconstruct, you get the option to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzworth according to your taste. however, you probably have to set it a bit higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digitization; - to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-filtered image sensor that provides a large picture of the colour filtered pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Whites came; and Dcrav put you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by DDC. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-softening of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, since you will be carried out during the raw converting.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile is translated to color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digipack; information like the color information of a bull room to translate into the other so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in picture editing / colour administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder can be stored in the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digitised; this folder will be studied during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; default squad; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the pipe file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The shade view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images colored, not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camerper and model you are using. not all profiles are created on the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain dyes or gamma-correction. currently, dcrav gamma is not available for conversions at 16 bit depths. this means that you need to carry the colon sounded yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof-profile with which you can emulate as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you can use image, since your printer has a smaller color range as your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated instead of leaving on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for which. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is obviously inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon kernel extension makes the style designed for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscape, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & KDE; picture distortions and image processing; many modules support that were written to collaborate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use and then these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about the KIPI modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals for the KIPI module.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitization; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. further information on the KIPI modules can be set up in paragraph editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, enlarging factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the top and including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, no of the functions will change the original photo before you use file save or the button save from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should put a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save time with file Save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restore the editing menu or restore the button 'button to restore the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by choosing updating or restored by choosing updating from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for return and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; about the return service or re-button in the toolbar button a moment longer press, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions are also undone or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the editing process, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture, or the entries in the menu file. if you have any changes in the Edit menu, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansile menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarging factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view, in which you use the Esc button. normally, you can change this in the settings dialog by & digitization; you can view this from the & digitization; main window display. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print out the actual picture, you can print on the menu text and get the default & KDE; print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print out individual images or whole sets. whole picture-pages can choose from your selection. you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the Album Album Exporting Printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digipack; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same page header is available, even in the picture editing. it is displayed when one of the five horsemen is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab may appear the side bar or disappear back to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the text-view you can insert text files with unlimited size or insert. follow the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the signs are copied into EXIFT and IPTCIP fields so that you may be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are deformed after 2000 characters and special characters are being formed. if you want to use the IPTC installation field in other applications, you should be aware of these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on either the button or simply switch to the next picture, the signposts are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the use-button there is one button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. this will always be done if you have selected a metadata attitude, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a measurement scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gradation. it can be used either with single mouse-click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the review from the sidebar is always used only to a picture at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows the diagram in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords view a search box for the filament of the keywords, the keywords and a combox with the previously mentioned in this & digipack; session of the keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is adjusted dynamically to the keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have lots of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series. if you entered different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the respective application fields in the tree. all keywords in a picture are saved into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and select a keyword in the keyword-tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, If you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page header information is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and viewpoints. if in addition one or more keyword filter from the right is used, only the intersections of these two is displayed. all presented keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view, to draw you with keywords, if the keywords already exist, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. then, a dialogue will be asked if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keywords will be displayed on no keywords, what the quantity on three pictures were reduced. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keywords to be removed and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at any start of the program. it can also be switched between different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it should be or be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searching for. this can be an album, name, keywords, image, keyword, etc..</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can e.g. choose a extended search across all the items in the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the tick field at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. then you see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have primarily adapted it to & digitisone's concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a Colorful workflow using the colors that actually photograph or scanned colors. with a colored workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanner, you can print or publish the colors that you choose from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to paint management, everyone wants to know what buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about color management workflows. in addition, you will provide you with more information about color management. in addition, you will enable links with deep information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image is met all six criteria listed below, you must not take care of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color scheme. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image records are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and make life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about Collingering?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can actually see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors that we can see, the hufiery region, and the colours in the sRGB color tree, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color, so visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and then click Info About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kiss my monitor, if I decided to work only in the RGB Color?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the RGB color tree or not, you need to finish your monitor kallions, since sRGB runs it. if you work as in the colour scheme of sRGB, then you need to either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before using a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalise, removable, automatic scanning and contrast from the menu navigation automatic correction will automatically try to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the luminance value over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the lightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded. this function is often a magic correction for images that can be washed or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Evenly: this method adjusts the lightest editor of the colours of the selected picture, so that the hoogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the same very good results achieved in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either wonders in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scanning: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue canal. it determines the dark and bright border-tones and aligned the red, green and blue channels to complete hoistograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and lightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the highest possible area and a revitalist of all values in between. this is only visible when watching images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-comparison of & digipack; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the whimoff of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-comparison correction is slightly limited since over a color-room with 8-bit per color is worked. if you are too far from the original picture, you can perform the white comparison in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-equation that is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start using the menu-made colors white abstained of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left are both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is adjusted dynamically the setting of the tool. if you want to see the original whipped image, then it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo features a red marker. the Luminumance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histgram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the top right, a hoistgram is shown that dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this hoistogram is very helpful, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminous values. with a button you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustable you can improve the shadow details of your photos or also get bored.</seg>
<seg id="401">Stopping at the above controls, you should use the color-temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture shows that automatically use selected color for the calculation of the white water temperature. this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally you can set the white comparison with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator indicates the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels is overexposed. this is displayed as a combined result in the whiteboard. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of the whiteboard you have set, you can hereby save in a text file and later load it again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets puts all filtration values back on their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. keep in mind that neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoders per colour channel of the beated image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding is also needed more disk space, compactation time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG available.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the modification and the allocation of color profiles. colour bar can be carried out through the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter of color-management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors soundproofing. this tool provides an integrated path to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to make use of these for multiple photographs. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same errors and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for the error correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tools Farbeffeked provides you with four color effects, a photovoltaic effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantor filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarzation, also called Sabatians, a effect of was created when you completed a partial pressure a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture completes it. the result was a partial negatively tripod of the picture. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar energy. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what chemically possible. a further increase ultimately generates a negative image that so does not produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation image. the original picture is the (1) and the edited the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliantly and glitter. try it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight converted colour which is produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a combination of & quot; Velvet Mediaquath; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvet offers him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photographers, especially those who wear hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates Neonlight at the contrast-edges. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neone. in big pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the colour contrasting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting entries can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light ratios, you can get the converted problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce it. any changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminance / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on the improvement of the exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of the slider. concrete the three sliders below the Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graphs are three sliding into the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left-hand side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regulator and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right you can view the original and preview of the picture. the preview is dynamically based on the settings of the picture. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box may be set whether the hoistogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmey axis. for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear representation of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the linear Histgram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logical Histgram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic disposition is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often gamma-values called.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colors pinpallets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is one button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values enable the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values as well as with the input values. the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background while being seen something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the data set in the filesystem can be saved and loaded again later. it will use the Gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color cassettes, the input values will automatically be adjusted to all the shadows, resources and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue, and the Luminanzkanals.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure indicator, controlled all color channels to find overexposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically based on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be indicated by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmetic view. for pictures included with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most sensuous mode generates linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will help continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a curve to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds with darker output can be Corresponsive and that the associated pixel are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line on the curve is displayed which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can make exactly this. each curve that you created can thus be saved in the filesystem and can be loaded later. the file format is the Gimp spa-format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three shades of color, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indicators of view all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel exposed to be overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you will see the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white picture, which has been corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and sun-tones was set with the paint pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-blender of & digipack; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel-mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel-mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint about how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line in Histogram appears to indicate the corresponding colour options.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you also activate Luminance, the picture mixer then activate the option Monochrom as the channel-blender then is THE GREAT tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrom, the reduction of a color comes to a visible rustling that appears from the color canal. color greats consists of small nozzles which does not appear at the same point in the paint channel and whose smoking pattern looks different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your Monochrom conversion in which you can reduce the farthing first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary mixer adjustment you can save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure indicator, controlled all color channels to find overexposed pixel and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which blue channel is re-aligned. the Luminumance option is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction skills. with the development of digital photography is black / white a workpiece, as colours can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film-roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all sceneries and fits perfectly well to portrait against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) grease.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfiltered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air-photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotation: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates indicator-effective and can simulate moonest during the day time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and middle notes while he adds a bit of cold in the shadows. this is very similar to the process of hiding one pressure and re-development in a Sepulatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digipack; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop-portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall. the menu-script picture texture applying the picture processing can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the semblance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textiles effect has been applied in the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digipack; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to put his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streamed eye. below picture can add the module from the picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired tacks for your picture. through, the image corresponds to a thin line, Niepce embraces it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), encled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button-effect and decorative frame adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: displays the width of the frame in percent. the value area for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame created target picture will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing of images, especially when you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can simply insert a reformatted text into an image at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with your mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color room and the character set with its properties as you need it. you'll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button 'OK'. after the picture once saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digipack; tool can be applied to a template using a template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image editing can be used in the picture processing can be used to divert templates over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to the size of the file size of the template, just send an e-mail in English to the & digitization; mailing list controls digipack-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must put your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates has been restarted a tree-view, which reflects the folder structure of the SchablonenordPad. the selection of a folder is updated the preview of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview there are three buttons with which you can change the enlarging factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduction: this button resized the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must knob the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the picture is then adapted to automatic size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization; three different tools are available at the field of sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but creates especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unblur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make an image sharply. in fact it doesn't work bit psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheres Dunst and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really enhances the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures need a correction of the acuteness. elements which are smaller than the resolution must therefore be summarized in a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if colored points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more detrimental as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG-images, a camera has often been applied to internal acuteness. images in the pipe-format on the other hand must always be weakened during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner will occur during the reading of the image already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by raising a photo with the field of field of field. this allows you to proceed with the menu entries in the field of basket.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should however deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the edge of the edges but reinforces the noise. in general the most usable technique for sharpening of an image is the tool refocus. under Reward you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool to mark soft character with the menu entries and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog displays the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help the picture to process. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and amount. the default values produce good results and should be proven first. an increase in radius or viewing will increase the effect. if you get the insharpness mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats are produced near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels on each side of a gun affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, they should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred picture added to the original one by the original one. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. one can thus define a minimum difference thus for a edge of the filter. in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpening and hence beauty malfunctions in faces, tyards and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blur masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitisation; tool refocus refocused on an image through improvement of the acuteness. it used the copyrighted corridors of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to raise an image & quot; refocusing quot; in which there is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it also uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. refocus most frequently achieved better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by entering the colors realising in the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding is far better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long dick, which is causing the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far away from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels. the causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the main parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the standard value should result in good results. you can bet a higher value if your image should become very blur, but then on Heiligenstadt.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help eliminate artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the smoking filter is too low, a usable value is 0.03. a high value will continue to consume the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche acuteness: this is the radius of the Gauß'sche field. it is most frequently caused by a previously led blurred filter. in most cases, you should be able to avoid this value to 0 in order to avoid colorfull artifacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you might need to also increase the correlation and / odery filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizenith: this value determines the size of the transformers. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular field or the Gauß'schen field. in most cases, you should select great value for that parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary realising parameters you have set is thus stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to carry out all the cuts, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture in otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgery changes that are not immediately visible, which however later leave uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you have pictures and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masks produced better results than sharpens. this could be causing this blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it must be blurred masking increasingly artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurred filter. it is practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture that needs to be corrected. this picture was made using an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the edge correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison to English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator gluttles presets the blur of the area of the dark, in order to produce a grease Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The paint tinte allows a adapted colour for the Pupille. in case you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool of infallium correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The author algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starter points to simplify restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed consider p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing about the picture. a value of 0.9 should be sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no tightening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detailed attitude always should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Passing dependence: Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes even in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity, or the CCD ruffles will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum saturation factor above alles. then defines the relative smoothing. place this value therefore appropriate to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoothed, because it's difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be passed on as often the algorithm. usually here is 1 or 2 out of.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should also be small. take care of that small angles create a long running time. therefore, you should choose this value as the greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stepper span [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value of smaller 1 in order to avoid sub-pixel glasses, and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only minor. but he doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. each setting of image errors can thus be retrieved in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">The errors corrected is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore cancel calculation at any time with the knob off.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be removed with Small artifacts. the module is made in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents selectable machine filters available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair at the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory cable from the camera or the modem; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on the sensory cable of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial on this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the lower advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius is controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter is per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius rally on the image and the color in it becomes smoothed and therefore smaller bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixelabt to determine the filter at the front. if it is lifted you will need to refine crap filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer obtain and smokes or lubricate enters again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for the edge. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed all of the noise or roughtips can occur. set it on a value close to maximise if you want to remove a waking noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance of the picture. we recommend you either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the grading process of which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the picture. we recommend you either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the grading process of which is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value may be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, however, also the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Steaming: controls the adjusting the phasenjitteriness. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtered radius is responding to variations of the luminance. if he is lifted up, the edges can occur. if he is at his minimum, noise and phaspiers may occur to the edges. he can remove noise and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the reduction of saving you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected one with (2). the noise reduction has been applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft, fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to mark soft character with the menu entries and experiment with the smoothing display on the right of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to decrease photographs by photographs.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts of your images. it is very well adapted to show rainbow's, granular, composites, and local errors that arise in digital, original or realizes digitised images. the smoothing occurs along the picture contours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the text replacement is carried out with another tool, the image fails. the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Franndorf and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG facts can be reduced: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compressing ppressionism, he generates some compression & quot; artifacts. - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this attitude shall correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can thus be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore cancel the calculation using the button below.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformity noises. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a minolta (tm) HP-5 movie has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granularity on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected one under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo recovery. this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts created by the scanner lighting and photo paper. the original picture is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digipack; tool Hotpixels allows you to remove hotpixels of photos taken with a CCD camera; it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are copyrighted by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; in a photo with an dark image subvert method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture review.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important that you will record the dark picture directly afterwards to discover new hot or bright pixel due to CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the fitting image to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard shows the last dark picture and this automatically loads the next session again.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview will help you correct the result. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixel are taken up in all foresight areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. this is the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is an average of the nearby pixels. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-Dim) or a group of linear curves (1-Dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-Dim) or a group of square curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be turned to compute a bi-kubische surface (2-Dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-Dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotscreen correction in a colour photo, from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, see. the original picture was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitised; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, one of the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Broader objective, especially those in the medium and large image format, can often not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor sector. instead & quot; vignetting of the picture; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by following the light that can reach the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has cons. many centers filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. far-angle objective should use the camera with center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise insignificant effects caused by movement arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large popularity areas of today's filtration and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalence transformation in a blank filter, which is used without this filter. the tool of Vignetting filter is applied to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light gravity at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, leading an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 2, or randomly an aperture of 2, splitting the density to compensate a greater degree of Vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Lighting, contrast and gamma settings: the edit an image with the Vignettle-correction reduces the luminance of the pixels. you need to refine the target image with these options. the regulators will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine refine-tuning of the target image, let the values for lightening / contrast / gamma with zero and use the gradation from the & digitization; picture machining from the menu colour gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of Vignetting correction to a picture. the original picture (1) displays the corrected image in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminance and contrast-correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitisment; liner distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar loop effect, but flap to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote corners to the opposite of the second gradient. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometric distortion virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of second degree. with negative values, they can be corrected to have tons-shaped distortions and positive values of cultivating distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the degree. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils the 'novels of parameters has the inverted sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value will scale the size of the image and thus leads to a correction of the first grading of. negative values enlarge as well as positive the image reduction.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value suspended the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the correction of the correction. the values you use for your picture are stored and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction or cilious correction should be performed prior to all clutter or size changes. best perform this correction than all the first by. if you perform a picture anew and then perform a tons-shaped correction would be the effect obvious of falsche.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it to an important place such as the sea side or a building wall, in your picture, and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the counter / cilous distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a callious distortion, the resulting image has black corners. you can transform it using the asmmer tool in the menu or remove the zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the spherical correction is derived from. the next logical step for some motives as for example shots from the front, frame and paintings is to have the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. keep in mind that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of tons-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible from this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the thumbnail you can set two parameters to simulate film granularity and film-sensitivity (ISO). activate the option to simulate film granularity. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows become white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter cartridge channels for reproducing infrared film is mixing, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, as the color-information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filth applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the original image has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of aura in the smoker.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter film granularity is an easy to use tool to reproduce film granularity, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known to increase the sensitivity of the films, the makers large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-basing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street cinematic, granular sight especially in your Monochromatic photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed to apply to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film grazing effects on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and working (2). the original film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digipack; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it used to use a protected protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digipack, filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature paintings and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to affect this effect. the top selects the pinselsize between one and five out. thicker brushes are suitable for great pictures. smooth controls the smoothing or, from the other side looks, the peculiarity.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the modified version is marked with the (2) pallet size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and gloss 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitization came; filter consistency of coal and intensity for generating a coal spices. the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed. pictures their gradient are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to scizers for you. this would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value area from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower aligned the contrast (gloss).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the consistency filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved upon adjustment of the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitization comes: filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stacked in wax. it used a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitization is a fast tool to give your images again with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filtering. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in the cells and let it look like it is seen through glass bucks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wave-blocks 1 the picture distorts here with a different version of glass-blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button 'button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of acuity effects. it uses protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom immunity: wipes the picture along stalled lines that go from a central point. this simulates the insharpness a zoomed camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imbalance: wipes the image by rotation of pixels by a center. this simulates the blur of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: wipes the image to generate the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion sequence: wipes the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the insharpness of a linear moving, z: B: out of a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softens blity blity: wipes the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and gloss soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelevfe: wipes the image due to random shift in pixels and thus simulates the blur of one of the random camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent infinity: find the colour in the picture and wipes these without the rest to change.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation using the button 'button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice little tool to make recurring on your picture. thus, it gives natural your images a nudinal appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dropping size allows to change the size of the drip. since the dropping size is not growing with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optical effect of the drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using the & digipack; image processing a area freely of rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, for example a face, which is to be free to stay. if you start the filter cage, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of a rainy Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can use it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. you can transform your tools in the menu transforming or transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo for a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to minor is simple. the big question is, how can you get a picture inflated and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here, makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many picture editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio is retained by entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoothed, because it's difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as much as loading are used exactly to it. each entry for photo can be downloaded as a text file and loaded later again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load after getting off. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button 'button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflatable, by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the default (2) is the result of the linear magnification to the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. the image processing allows you to simply cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. by doing so, you can change the size of the slide area by pressing the corners of the rectangle by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the random section, use the button 'button' button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file save or file saved under the menu file to store the newly coded photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbnail, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you defined in dialogue remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the field of aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and the width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Up aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same whether you use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to filter the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bottom in dialog you can set the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool committing its settings depends on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the default tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will be reflected in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of interconnection help allow help to blending your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic dividing are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-party gel, harmonic triangles are an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden middle is a split into different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of Nautilus shells or the blacks of a sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things we feel as nicely.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational figure 1.618033988... and you already used the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number according to 1 equal the sum of their two preceding numbers is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides fluid auxiliary lines if you put an image together. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos to achieve closer. compared to third-party gel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the rectangles of golden spiral, also called Golden rectangles. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be just there without being able to fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also lead from the above discussed golden spiral. your vertices are the middle points of the pages of golden rectangles. notice that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden Triangles are not indifferent triangles. diagonal to these lines can be placed a static object of dynamical appeared.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles in order to break your frame create a effect of professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try your picture-focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally reflect and brance can be used to reflect the harmonic sections.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are shot by a angle. you can fix this with the & digitization; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider corner. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can put the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown to the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is available with a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture show around the two lines. after you move it via an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair is it to transform the function to use the function to use.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cutting function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing slipped the picture a bit after the rotation. keep in mind but the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectively transformations are performed by a fixed point of the reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialog you will find some information which can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: indicates the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective, the image will be a little lubricated. for an individual adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments make a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After being adapted to the perspective you will receive unfun triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is the image with transformative suing from the picture machining.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal resolution, e.g., the picture becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a Parallelogram. you can transform this module into a Parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Drag your image by clicking the horizontal angles and the vertical angle. you can push horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on preference, the angle will be displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help a vertical and horizontal line appears. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the shot, the picture becomes a bit wiped out. for a single shearing this effect is usually neglected, but two switching produces twice as much blurring and hence, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is the picture with transforming the cutting of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitization; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read image formats and write. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiling. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digitization; only files in formats you know. this happens according to the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can change this list of file extensions & digitised. in the configuration file you can find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format you use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitization; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compressioners on digital images. thereby redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression disproportion. the 2000s version can also store loss when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw material format, you can read below Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English. you can convert pipe-format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digicome; in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with & digipack;.</seg>

<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as XML-file in the gpx-Format.gpsbabel and gpsman you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can bring a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu on. the top to visual dialog then appears. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a file file with GPX file. of course, this file contains the same time recorded at the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation that displays the coordinates in red. GPS routing dates are recorded in GMT. this can be done with the time zone. here, you can use your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera limits. the deviation below are summarised. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality you have a local difference in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put this limits here and then push the button correlation to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same site. since the dialog displays the coordinates of a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map and enlarge. choose this in the region and enlarge it. the level must always be selected manually. the card can always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite images and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, using a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can insert a base screen. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV der Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. with this module, you can create a background color for the slideshow. using this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first choose the images packed into the MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module of extras.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then enumerated among image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should choose the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is preset and probably choose the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which will indicate a picture. the speed of the picture is defined below. a low value creates a sudden, high contrast, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and the path of the created file can be set at the name of the MPEG-output file. keep in mind the ends.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the movie. after you adjust all settings to your preferences, you can start with the button coding the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now take a coffee or enjoy a cup of coffee whenever you're back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiver or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packets on the right bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper together in standard photographs. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to enhance you or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcrav by Dave Coffin. an original itat of Him is: expect you from dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera producer. sometimes you get better results with dcrav better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and run the module. the rew image converter will appear then in the mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now refine the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be adjusted for the white-comparison. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be aligned. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch works no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossy-free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are going to frequently edit your pictures or use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format before it's just a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as memory format, the metadata contained in the raw file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The way of stacking mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the opportunity to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar appears as far the conversion progress has been progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starting and the timestamp of the album to be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize the image smaller or enlarge. these are provided four types of image change:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed on this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo pressure before. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the indicated images before. additional pictures can draw on the list of images to be drawn and stored there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After which you started the module, the pictures of the window will be displayed using the pictures selected from you. using the button images you can add additional pictures with a file selector. for the last selected picture will preview a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images on the image list and drop it there to add the list of images to sening images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button will remove pictures from the list of images to be removed from the list.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your email with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the refuges here. the pictures selected by you are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure you don't send too many pictures at a time. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the notification e-mails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and every time you use it to change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the GMailagent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selection of comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are attached to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files as e.g. TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are added, then the original output data will be added to the sening pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not automatically closed the status messages, looking for errors, you can view it. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the knob button you can write this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the modal Fortress Diashau you will find a window with questions like you want your slideshow. you can choose between the chosen and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation provides very elegant pictures with OpenGL. you have to have a corresponding graphics card, since otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the filename of images can be displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop loop. you can then manually break up with Escape.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures accidentally select that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">While the images can be set between the images the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 Millisekunden meet 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly, choose a different effect in any transition between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diashau you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can keep the presentation and start again, to the previous and the next picture, and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date is currently failing. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team among KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets out the currently selected picture, depending on the chosen option of the submenu, as background for your KDE.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse through this browser, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in individuals, locations and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories, for which you entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course see the current thumbnails. in the following, each of them is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person just select the images on which both persons can be seen. through this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand pictures to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected any of the persons, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the pictures of your activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can store with & kphoto- but for each person has its own preview picture, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined for. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have appropriate images) for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must choose to choose which image should be displayed for each individual person. to view this, you have to select the picture activation window (in closer) and select the image for the corresponding person. in the case window, you can customize the picture factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cutted.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the entry list in the main window, a dialog will be displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for the celebration of the image characteristics. this dialog can be viewed on the picture yet again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description of the images according to this text. if you want, you can also enter a date according to the date; the date can either be part of the overall date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a section of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all the images on specific names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, are not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try equal functions, you have the following alternatives to this guide:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kfotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshot and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kick album; and select the demo album in the first dialog, or select the photo album; for the first time, or select the menu help menu-free photo album; finally, some sample pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kfotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name already says, this bar displays you data records about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each body then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing threads only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can edit the displayed entries file view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date is displayed in the Preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button pressed and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so. if you select an area, you will see in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kfotoalbum; gives you two options available to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; the following part of the user manual is described in & kphoto-; integrated version, which you can create from the menu item HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overlooked and a description which should contain HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & klag album; export file is to be created on the overview page. nutritional information on export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to see that information is displayed without description. note that the viewer can also be displayed without description. note that & kfotoalbum; currently all pictures are exported. you can not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular beware.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look. most of the settings are unambiguous, which is why not respond specially to this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can set different resolutions for the images below. this allows those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download it for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time, search. if he wants to get an image larger then he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best choice for all of your HTML files, and select a new subfolder for all of your html files.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you must select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. you can either select a folder or any of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible for viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, this folder should be. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you, you need to manually copy them into it. so that the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The currently described options have all been related to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a business party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphoto-; together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. if you have, of course, you can create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you have, however, you can write an HTML page on the images, reception, etc. then you have to do with & sounding album; this work will not even happen once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Cow album, you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the imaging features are processed with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it if the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage all images can be stored in the file and that you can pass this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two simple way. first, the pictures are not found in the folder of .kim file. if the respective pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images, which you can view through the menu File Exporting... View profile.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be for internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When executing the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically to copy the .kim file, copy & paste video; the pictures automatically copy for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most images have been compressed to JPEG. as most of the images have been compressed to JPEG. it is normally not the files to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is the maximum picture size limit. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by specifying that each picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File menu, the export database is imported as described in the database.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard on imports consists of four steps. first, you have to select which images you wish to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalise the category persons of the import file (if you are a Dane) while this category is called in your database. therefore, in the third dialogue window, the categories which are imported to imported file and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to import the categories of the file to import file with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and view: if you look at pictures you often want to see within different picture groups and mdash; if you want to see some pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this guide you will find the various steps from (1) Festing the information about your pictures, through (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced subjects and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">Kphotoalbum was started as a program for managing your images. it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this guide, about pictures spoken, but often, it also includes videos featuring one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Kphotoalbum; saves all of his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup from a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kfotoalbum; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically it at future Starts; if you want to start another database with pictures, you can start a different folder tree; with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entries of the photoalbum; set up... come to a window by which you can change the settings of & kphoto-; in the following section of the user's guide you will be explained the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can view six different symbols, with which you can access settings options and options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help available, which you can call by a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it, you describe how to set different properties for each picture, for example people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You see the dialog box that is used to edit already existing groups. for each available group you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in dialogue options allow you to set up full members, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explaining all groups of a member state as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the settings that are available to you for the celebration of the members, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kfotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means KDE; Image plugin Interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kfotoalbum; are, but are distributed separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules are tested with the demo database; on this account you should try new modules first with the demo database. you can either call these on your own pictures without a copy album &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules on KIPI can be very different, allowing it to be that some modules with & sounding album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules that can be ok on albums, so that you can use the functions with & sounding album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here simulates & sounding album; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album has to be & sounding album; the modules also have a list of albums. here is a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums. so if you are using the category persons, it will be selected & sounding album; so do if you would have selected persons to view and share this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are compatible with & kfotoalbum; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the section modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; with your own pictures start.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to any other KDE application, see the window below a menu bar and a toolbar. at the same time, it does not contain a lot of information as you do not have any information about your pictures. in the section, we'll come back to this window, but now click on the entry to show you an overview with all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with notes. these include information on the persons appearing on the picture. you can set any picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper pictured and all images were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for seeking and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by placing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphoto-; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to push the images within the list: if you have for example a family business and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are illustrated, so that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to have an alphabetical list displayed, click on the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any annotations for each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images and include these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click the front and back buttons that are shown below the thumbnail on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window which indicates the US as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue of catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over-category or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and drop it to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you have just sorted your categories alphabetically. see you also.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the dialog, by forming the heap of the boxes, click and postpone the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a private window by moving it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and here you will see a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry pictures in the browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images if you do not have a filter here. you can see the size of the thumbnails by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set as the background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture display. if you have not opened any window with an image background, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image gallery. simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete and select either the Delete button or select from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Kphotoalbum; for this problem you can use a solution. you can also use images stored on the hard disk. of course, you have to save the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can record the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can see in the database index; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present; so you can view the preview of these images. however, you can also view these pictures with the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, you need to copy files from folders and copy them again. so if you want to ask for the insertion of the involved CD. if you want to avoid any trouble, just like the mess Bring of your images, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, you can filter the images that you want to make for others inaccessible and click on Current View in menu privacy. alternatively, you can also lock all pictures that can see your little sister, filtering and select the menu item everything except modern view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set out which images in the case of the fall you want to be hidden. if you want to block the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu item that you want to be locked. if you want to see the pictures again, click Sperre uplift.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that has to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe. for one there are all pictures on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can only read the password as unencrypted text; this type of password protection serves only to those who are using & sounding album; not very familiar to captivate the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you can manage all your pictures with & sounding album; manage and hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason it has a picture _ and VideoPad. this is why you can preview the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he of course shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, just drag and drop it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is available to the viewer. all these options are available from right-clicking on the viewer. you can see the text-menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, see the browser, see matching entries for this. so if you click Anne Helene, the browser displays you all the pictures by Anne Helene. as if you were people from the browser and then Anne Helene would have chosen.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you loaded several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back by using the buttons image high and image below. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slideshow. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful skill of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is in full screen mode switch. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can jump into the picture and zoom out. with the mouse button you can drag a rectangle. with the minus key, you can throw again zooming The Plus button zoomed in the middle of the picture. shows how an zoom rectangle is marked and displays the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed to zoom. with the equation-key, the zoom key consists of the zooms, so that each pixel is equal to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Notice that the only zoom operations work with videos that come in and zooming with the plus and the key key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you can see a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can view it down and open configuration dialog of the image to insert it. however, you might prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what pictures you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the spectator gives you the opportunity to paint pictures with characteristics, while you are viewing it. characteristics are the letter A to Z and you can set a characteristic by clicking the appropriate letters. in view, see a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you've set any features on your images, these are available to you. so if you have all the images you want to edit, print or whatever have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or what ever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can display categories in your thumbnail, then you can add features to the images by pressing the letter for the index after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case allows you to paint a photo album; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undown your old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture, you can see a picture painted on the painted pictures. in order to switch the painting on the context menu. to finish the painting, simply drag the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; do you need to control the application of the program & povray; not fully control, but the documentation about & povray; you should absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties, and the object in the wire-plates are shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the subobject of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected using the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object-tree, select the position in which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following menopper menu appears, so you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Deleting either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on the application to apply these changes. if you have disconnected values, a message is displayed with a bug description. then you can right click the input box and then re-use the changes to break down.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the interior dialog, you can call the & povray; reference to the object shown by means of help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL users, in order to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download them here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the peculiar view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click Preview in the peculiar view and a small sample of the scene is signposted with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is selected, even if you want a submerged element (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a wire-level of visibility. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object, or as an absolute value. objects will only appear if they are selected or their visibility to be smaller or equal to the selected stage of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window-setting as default. the object tree and the view of the object traits are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can freely adjust it. you can also save several windows of window-orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or under a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange several views over each other, draw the beginner in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map folder on the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window-order are Swedish views: views that are not included in the main window. to view a view from the anchor, drag the beginner to the desktop or click the little to the left arrow icon in the connector.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the toolbar. to prevent the closing, click on the little square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are hovering, you can anchor them to any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved in view window-order... saving it. a dialog displays, in which you can save the window-order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">When you have created a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler; used & povmodeler; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be properly installed. when this manual was written, was & povray; 3.5 currently. this version is currently supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click on the icon Renders in the toolbar or select the menu navigation menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview of up to full photos of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or in the menu View menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, useful, but a name that lets you detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can fill the width and height of the cropped image. if you just want to renders a small area of the image, select the cross-section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinational field quality you can select the characteristics that uses & povray; this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is wiped out with only one beam per pixel, there may be different errors. these paintings often have a Moirè pattern or trim effects in curves and lines, besides, sometimes details are not shown, if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this feature are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling requires the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive, recursively, because every pixel is still further divided and adaptive because the reflex-depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method to select POV-Ray one ray per pixel. if the difference between the dyes to the neighboured pixels was taken with super sampling. if you adjust the repository value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a lowering of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values given the predefined threshold, the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are tracked separately and on further classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the low-depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn out Jittering, alters & poray; the beams around a tiny amount in order to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final attitude for the quality of the rences is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it is calculated very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no property made.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & povray. if & Povray; when & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & povray; scene to import, select the menu Postscript file Imported... and choose a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command of & povray;. if you encounter any error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawan end.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to editor to export the source code for & povray; this adds to the source code of the object in the editor opened. to import objects in the scene, simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also in your editor.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the Help menu view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & povray; user account documentation displayed here. set the path to your documentation and the version. here are the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altitude difference) to the & povray; libraries. if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also list the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color will be used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type identimarks.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire-model views. you can set the Raster separate for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed amplifier for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Details Ladue for extended projections, all wire Model messages will be further divided, when the camera uses an extended projection. enhanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is wiped out. the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the ground, a bottom is shown below the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantateness, the non-recursive antialiasing method uses for the renders of the scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. more detailed information on parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window maps or create new window orders. in the section pane orders, you can create and store windows.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational field standard-window-order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window-order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list available window orders, displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be added to the button "" "" Add "" "" button, and remove a selected arrangement with the button "" "" Delete "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window-order is identified by the name. the name must be clearly and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can be added to the button Add and delete selected views with the button 'button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with inlets you anchor the window below the existing window, with map view, together with the previous view and hovering over the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you will get as a result just a black screen. if you use a 3D program for first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to renders as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert a light source, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following subset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so that you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire Model View shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you create. in particular, you notice the scene of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this is the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, you can see the content of the object properties, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & povray; find more details about it.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is later tutorials, but note that the camera can change in view Control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press the input button, the wire Model views and the slide-tree will change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could insert a quader for example (inserting body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a bit-bit method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides an easier option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button or press Enter. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Now the wire-design view also indicates the level, although at the moment only as a limited European level. when you renders the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you see the object tree accurately, you will find that you can clap the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the soil to exercise an unit under the skyline, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the soil to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something different at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will open in which you can select how the object is inserted in. please select the object tree. you can preview the name in the object tree (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matt-black material because you have to insert settings for the pigment yet. therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but you now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are unable to preview any color on Quader and ball, click on the button below and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now correctly set. if you want to renders your picture now by clicking on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. which you have expected. here are some more settings necessary. then select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently but the chess-board menu list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select in the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object features:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you simply be able to perform, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you have already understood the ball as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button to push), so the ball rolling out over the ground, since you have moved the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now gives a strange result: how to see earlier, the ball surface appears like a matt-black material. set the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the subject object and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on sphere Pigment, choose then monarly and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve even more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection comes already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities are you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracen, that renders the renderer from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that displays the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render is calculated, like this ray through the objects and is broken, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how can affect atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene pixels be edited for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene which should be framed, some light sources and at least a camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file which you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if a new file, you have to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Represents the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage can be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be chosen if you have not stored stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the least undesirable command. this menu entry can only be used if you have used editing them.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window-order and opens a dialog when you type a name for a new order or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcuts and behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can edit or add new commands with this option for "kpovmodeler; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for "kpovmodeler; commands and remove the commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to apply rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a Bump map as well as a texture Map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of this basic bodies. these models are then further edited to give them a real look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels base, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuecshow; is a more comfortable picture-controlled and navigator. the application has a file browser which allows you to choose images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & Jickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists the files you can play with clicking the & LMBn; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window or whether any images always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a particular file, simply type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. if a password file name is found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field through the press of Return or & Esc;</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog box - & kuecshow; there are five card cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can adjust the working method of a cuddlock; set in the two other, short command for the display window and short command for the browser, you can set the keyboard shortcut for the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can further down. default is not a full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point is activated, loads & cuddle; already the next picture in the folder, while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture and is particularly suitable for slideshow.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or you can simply enhance the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarook and Amarook. the easiest way is to use the command dcop, which should be attached to any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts allow the running of external programs and commands. in this way, the Exec function () function is used. this way dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; sends messages to all running scripts. to this cause, strings to the standard input of script. for this reason, script should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should also ignore when there is no use for it.</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded by a web server. such packages are basically normal tar-archives (.tmp), which can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), which allows the user to detect the archive clearly as the Amaroscript package.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarook; is an audio player for Unix systems (like for example; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarook requires only the package of Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarook; needed some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presupposes that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gomas will function so, but fluxbox will help for example. we try to support Amarook on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably you will see one of your files an error in the TagLib library. you can read the file by clicking on ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amaro.kde.org and also hang out the broken file that has caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly lies that Taglib when reading Meta information out of this file is crashes. please report this mistake to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarook; is something mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries were compiled by & Amarok; when the libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, day Lib, but with GCC 3,3.x compiled, then this leads to the editing of Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you are using KDE with artsd then deactivate it. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value from 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens up automatically with a crash) and you will send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program writes data as UTF-8 to meta information, but they do not mark as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarois uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep Qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any collizing Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarook finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems arise at lightest by means of an expert of your UNIX- or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. do they also use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amaro.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help to search. please enter there only one error if you do something at the removal of a bug in Amaroitself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears to be only one blank playlist. how do music appear there?</seg>

<seg id="1366">Right under the toolbar you will find a search filter. he behaves in the list of control, as well as in construction control. references to the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter you will find a selection panel, which allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. besides, you can also select your entire collection, which makes the filter virtually off.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playlist browser designed the handling of many playlists is quite simple. among other things, it also contains Intelligente playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent playlist. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the intelligent playlist consists of:</seg>

<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you can get a address bar with which you can get music from a embedded URL. if you press for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music from there in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist longer is used than in the window, the breakdown of files by simple case can be difficult. in the case, the suspend of the Shift key may be helpful: thereby falling files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the wall position.</seg>

<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller. for example: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces, which have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces, which do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these synthetic ingredients according to popularity. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bath. this searches for all pieces, which either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>

<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to launch CD and redistribute all videos on the basic folders on the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method, recently opened projects recharging projects again. the relevant submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project has been stored once again, the previously set file is overwritten, otherwise it is asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialog Save As is displayed, with which you can choose folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. this is the same if you would like to save to each individual project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. when a project has changed and has not been saved, asks & K3b; after what to happen. you can then switch between saving and modifications. besides, you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closed all opened projects. & K3b; will inquire for each not stored project what is to happen, just as if you've been called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closed all opened projects and ends & K3b;. for each not stored project is asked, what to happen so as if you would have been called a file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you access this entry, you can select from entering the dialog files for adding a project. this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view to the Project View. if the current project is a data CD, the files are added in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "burning" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described about the What is that? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only be used with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it led to import & K3b; files from the previous session will always be involved, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help so that you can already see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function prompted & K3b; to import files from the current project. all other files are stored in the project. this feature does not remove files from the medium, it blinded only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the Copy CD dialog. this also allows copying a CD to a different medium. alternatively you can also only create an image from a CD which you can then burn later on. you should also prefer folding if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the Copy DVD-dialog. this also allows copying DVD to a different medium. alternatively, you can also only create an image from a DVD, which you then will then burn later. also, the target medium must be big enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. so you can delete all of the contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>

<seg id="1471">Burns a previously established CD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Nero * .nrg -files are currently not supported, for this you must use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously extended DVD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously-recorded DVD movie can be transmuted. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table, but can also be used all-standing, but it contains information about the extracted video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and to cut black edges.</seg>

<seg id="1477">Enables the folder view or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the screen view is activated, its content is displayed in the index view. CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with features such as media info, lock and removal of the drive or throwing the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Divides the index view or off. the table view allows the select and drop files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Dividing the header bar in the view view, or off. the head bar is a narrower area that is only visible when the Project View open projects. the header bar has no real function, it looks only pretty and separates the project perspectives clear from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to modify the button classifications for & K3b; after having chosen one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the shortcut to it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the K3b; furniture wizard. so you can use the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this reason, privileges must enter the password for the system steer (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; to use the functions, you can either use the command line utility dcop, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionality, so is more your taste and the type of your task is crucial to which the program programs give you a move.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we suppose that you use the command line utility dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions to use, you must first make sure that & K3b; start something like the following on the console:</seg>

<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1495">& Caudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; files in WAV files on disk) and by many encoders that are encoded (compressed) default for OGGs and FLAC (loss of files). additional coders can be added to the program (if they were installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on your computer (loss and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, is compiled by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggie up (for OGG) or other encoders have to be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary to compile some Linux distributions. however, only the encoders will need to be installed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the Chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction on encoders, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for the reading of audio data from the & CD;. this program is not intended to handle any copying audio CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD's device is not possible to handle any protected audio CD; do not prevent the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While it has to be done only once (the furnishings dialog), but can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration found), the daily handling of a & CD; on the hard disk explained. this results (hopefully) to understand the slender approach of the user interface, which you can often stumble in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can fetch a CD; information from the freeDB from the internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main alignment dialog by & Kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you to choose the right encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information generated by data compressing depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG tend to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower rates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions available free of charge but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a machine based music system and / or when one of the few existing OGG abelle devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo. today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should typically offer for most people and most of the music fans accepted transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hifi testers with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. needs more and 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need cBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate, about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. well enough for the music of young people, portable devices and car parks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually inserted or retrieved by the program from the freeDB program, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / sell with & kaudiocreator; and the codification program for the folder and file name, as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programming concepts for the code of the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the code editors explain the switches for these programmes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to add the keywords (English: day), if MP3s must be coded by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & D auditions; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That is what the freeDB file is: a free database where people can download the audio CD releases, so that all others can download this information instead of being inserted into the calculator. it is noted that here only by text is said: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberger) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information no more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicated. all information can be obtained from a bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to choose a tick-field (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address while retrieving the data from the server (This may not only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used for use of freeDB, the geographically will be used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; whoever wants to know more accurately, look in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see also note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed from the suitable distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the read-read WAV files the code can be selected and thus the file format selected for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossy-free compression for audio data) on the tab of the encoders. other Kodierer can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the encoders can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. for more information about Kodierer can be found in Chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, further information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolenpane window (console; Console) will be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">That can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading process, and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you are not a copy audio CD; read out. check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, to set up everything and our first & CD; read out '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile the source files, what you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please be sure to copy the directory / usr / share / cd, and that you have screwns on it (eg; by trying to copy something with the Conqueror.)</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which probably needs to be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each ausite & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the to used Kodizer to compressing the music (lame) as well as the resulting tone quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy, we can use the program using the freeDB program to download the & CD; data from the internet to load.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will likely not change them with any configuration of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device drawing is delivered to the read-out program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real equipment drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD Drive is available, the effective device name can also be accessed. if you can access the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device name for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General settings. here, there is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of uncomplete information please select so that you will be notified if data are missing by keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet, while the Internet has to be connected to the Internet, so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry was found immediately, when you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the filename names / filename, or filename, you can easily change. the directory or filename is changed using Conqueror &gt; name and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, it continues to be noted: if you want to manually enter all the selection fields and freeDB mode, if you download the database first. however, it is worth over 620 MB, consider whether this is worthwhile. to freeze the two selection fields, the two selection fields must be selected at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server over the Internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about freeDB. set it all the way it pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as though many firewalls have to boot the protocol 8880 default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit a CD; data to the freeDB server and deactivate the first tick-field should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screenshot now. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number at the same time allowance pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time just one existing drive? paralleles reading and code? the author knows not, therefore simply trying themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: ticking this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folders for temporary files: if you are ticking the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored, the files will not be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder when you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All just enter as it is in the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something to be leased to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is an average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1' only 'for the restriction of the production of tags at version V1 / V1.1.' ID3v2 'tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent' ID3 'Day for & KDE; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>

<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to encoding WAV files: when dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encoding more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic establishment of & kaudiocreator; terminated. this configuration is chosen as a standard for any reading a & CD; used when you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; installed on the hard disk, the folder structure, which is organized in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be collected, has to be repeated for each outgoing & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use the screenshots below a little different from those for a & CD; with successful from freeDB files. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data will manually enter, instead of taking it out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>

<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the ticked box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger you by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the input 'News', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist should no longer be entered in the input field 'actueller title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidisoya per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of the data from the freeDB code, the CD editor will not be empty, but it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor. however, it is always a good idea to begin the content of the CD editor (for example, if all words begin with large letters, or not...), but also to consider if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and on only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field-length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up in the tab code settings; take a look at the section 'default settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag posted on the day later, with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the manual for the Kodivan to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of the ausal CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyhow we go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example will be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to main window. simply click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album have already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the titles of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB database. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there has been a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read out. simply clicking on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at one time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking the button selection reading the reading process, so this window appears to confirm. OK, and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what they proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click the tab orders for switching on the order window. it is in the top half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left corner of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you're trying to work with a encoders that you have not installed yet. pieces which have not been successfully coded using a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder of the tmp file and the target folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. therefore, read and code parallel. notice the status message at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that is configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. for efficient machines the result is unclear. the machine used with a AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous interpreting and code (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title will be read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the codile. after the last piece is coded, a small window will be shown with a message for a short while in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to individuals who compiled source files and are not intended for users who use a precompiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be customized to your needs when it runs, then the following is true for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many varieties of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of different card cards of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still am reading? even if only the help menu has been clicked on this site, without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow empty screen (especially when it is at the time of the program boot no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">Why is it? who reads this, has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can not maintain this manual. it is meant as the first version for a manual for & kaudiocreator; think. whoever wants to add or change anything else, may it do. at least, after contacting the author. and when you read this, he has to leave this section and therefore agree with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when we have succeeded in bringing the source file from & KDE; SVN, then you don't need these informations but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Caraokespieler from & KDE; in addition to others it has a real-time highlighting of texts also some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& Cmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and KDE; & Cmid; also supports the & Linux; ultra-at projector, which is required for the CIS.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (songwriting or textile events). KMid will automatically determine the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish and KDE, during playing a song, Kmid will start again with the same song again.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select opening... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & Conqueror; window in the & kmid; window will fall. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and enter the button knob in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or choose the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the & kmid-window. (with multiple pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & Kmid; one piece is playing, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or too slow to play, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempoad and then change the playback speed. to get back the original speed, double click the Tempoon LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The spacebar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the spacebar appears like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece, thus interrupts the reproduction. if you play the spacebar during no play, starts & kmid; the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music. some pieces use textile pasture, others use lyrics, others use lyrics text and again others. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically selected to enable a song, so you do not have to manually set an item for automatic shutters. you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up a reminder type, select from the menu settings on the entries or property events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. those are being played in this section as you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. these can be found in the menu collection under the point of Organize.... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the scripts in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs that you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not stored. please check this if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in collecting managers. there you can add adding a song using the button Add. it appears in turn the file dialog, using whose help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic adding to collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, one piece by opening (using file Open or drag & Drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically added to the collection is not activated, when opening one piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then add the continued to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence according to the submenu section of the menu items, the songs are played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you select songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To keep a song further, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu item or push the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back down a song, select the button preceding piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or push the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is stored when leaving & kmid; it will not be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general MIDI events translated into events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, which converts all the events of Type Change to Bright Piano in Events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always leaves a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all soundcards GM are compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI Maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file containing all required rements for the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section must appear only once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as many times as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END, that the end of an section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI can be pictured on your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the Equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line to one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is needed to put all notes, which will take this instrument to put the tone with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is like a gun. to this end, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI-file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun loading), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the patch is meant here with the term drum patch of the patch (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;), and not the one who means the sound of the sound of the same drum (like him possess some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sound is pictured on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP -section the order of lines is very important, as well as the presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboard maps are used mainly to form tones on the perp-channel channel. check out for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel exchange, simply take it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a certain channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is included in the channel, which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the Keymap will of course be defined further into the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events are ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, then patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option Forcepatch can be useful for example to use the Percist patch on the perp channel channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is to be multiplied by the ratio of Pitch petting events. so if a MIDI-file sends a pitch using the value, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to make no decimal file in the map file).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard, which is a pitch-gasoline-event with the value 4096, a sound higher to play. unfortunately, try some keyboards higher up to an octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivials you see which sounds are currently playing.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list, where you can select an instrument, the knob will not be green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to indicate the pointed tones. view in the Settings menu under the Point View: Settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so, for example you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can result the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can compel no one, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression disproportion of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection but I do not want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. open the folder you want to add in & Conqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & Cmid-window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Activate previously the setting Automatically Adding to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can switch from the arrow to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD panel.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have one & KDE; desktop desktop a & Conqueror; window with my MIDI folder and kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or swinging on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I'd like to play a file only in the & Conqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file fast, without adding them into a collection, turn off automatic adding to collection, and the new; file will add to temporary collection</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you will have the MIDI files Amid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you only want to play the first file. so you set the setup automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then includes exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. to all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me, continue to program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to split the preferred linkages under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played to each other, so you should use the category of thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you choose an entry, his group and all its subgroups to the current category will be copied and playback starts with the indicated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updated piece ', TV and thumb playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can do that only when & kmplayer / apps / apps / kmplayer /, can be modified using a category, but also through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category clickle that is displayed in the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu has to be selected from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the mode mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and finishing can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc and Change of [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted simply.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will follow the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / km.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically finished by opening another source. this would be disruptive at the end-animation however, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; smilds; & lt; and / / home / Koos / mum.gif "src =" inist "src =" inist "src =" ingeni.gif "src; & lt; / bodysugt; It is in the directory testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path of the Mplayer and the clipboard size can be adjusted from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. here is an example like a "flash 'with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special area Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To give the & kmplayer; 'flash' into HTML pages, the & kmplayer must be specified as a service provider for the MIME type and / x-Shockwave flash in the furnishings dialog file of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or Betkmplayer; is available in an consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there is no error occurs, the backend issue is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Therefore always a given backend for a given MIME type is taken (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual modifying the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon must reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be used, the scanner must be used in dialog box, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the kmplayer is to use the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected some ports (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name is probably included a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo, this type of playing of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works. for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server needs to be functional. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; emfies the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in structure, the single elements can be changed and viewed by one mouse click on each of them.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful the RÃ ¼ rich file (engl. D e V ice I noun File)] was created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -spectator to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the appropriate output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and for printing of DVI; files for different systems and scent.</seg>

<seg id="1768">File name: in this mode, the DVI; file on the subject of nakeâ viewed, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick-making.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When considering the editing toolbar, the three major selection fields should be noticeable. the selection fields have been developed for the fast setup of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for the classification are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field further is for the addition of articles such as keywords, fucking notes or references. the options available are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a term for a section is created, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for the reference to a fixed term (selection of a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote will display a selection list with literary ones. at & bibtex; this only works if the file is necessary to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can be written also in & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name Grind is used for defining the font. it enables the fonts to select the main text, the fuck notes etc. set. there are the following fonts for installation:</seg>
<seg id="1775">In the call of & kile; there are two choices options to add: 1. the wizard shows the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and proper settings. 2. the document can be written by hand on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets at the\\ Documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays down the font. if the lettering is not at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; single source code has to be compiled. the easiest way is to make use of building construction or buttonic quick-making.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved from the compiling. & kile; the storage is automatically expelled.</seg>
<seg id="1779">The compiling of the document fails, should be searched in the logging for the errors. when using fast installation should be started & eyepiece; this is not the case, should also be taken into account details.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size is created 12. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ by {environment}).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The functions are cleared only within the vicinity (from\\ begin} to\\ end {environment}). there are no signs (number) for the editoring within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many features to improve the readability of readability and usability of the document. it enables you to place for example certain fonts, fat pressure, elective pressure, submissions, etc., either with the command\\ by command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is until it is closed until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: establishes a quotation in the document. the quotation begins with\\ begin {ratio}, and ends with\\ by {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; drawing language is shown, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be accomplished. there should be mind. a quote, a few places in the air and course of course and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document was viewed, using Editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and Spaak.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a framed file format (engl. D e V ice I num). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer created. there are many different types of the .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the Drucken of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document es (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can be printed by file (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar button is the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; -file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion is beginning to begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search for the direct jump from the editor to the common position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. this must be composed only Modern under settings kile... tools building design.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to find the precautions, the mouse pointer is positioned in a line of the source text and attach it to the first clicks. the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI; -viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; it is done with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document of & kile; appropriate and attached to the corresponding line; for this must be defined & kile; in & Okrug; as a text editor (attitudes Okkupation... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of quick-making of the & DVI; viewers can not allow a mistake to exist. should an error be available, this will appear in the log file or in the message window summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file obtains the error source in the source code. in the editor you can see the buttons related between the errors. the log file will always be used the line in which the error appears. to see the faulty line, must be clicked on the errors in the logging and & kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the respective button on the toolbar, a window appears to choose the template for the document. the proposed features are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">With selection of empty document, a document can be either written or used either by reason or the wizard for a fast creation of a new document. additional information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. designs can be produced in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either to create an existing & tex; - / latex; -file created or create a new file. & kile; a new template to create an existing document and selection of file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using a file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or string encoding). these variables can be set in settings kiosk... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the additions to the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the original template will be used instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from all & latex; files will be created a simple way to create a template, should be looked after one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; used as an internal Editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the features of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made in the menu item directly out & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his features should be drawn to Kate's manual. users of & kile; you can go there directly with reading the chapters with the editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called the menu-help LaTeX reference guide. it includes a detailed description of nearly all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-clicking Ctrl key to falsify the & tex; that means in this way by clicking on\\ by\\ par\\ bigness just\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with the left mouse button the selected text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can use the arrow keys you can use parts of the source text in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the features to browse through different types of sources of source and to highlight it. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include one type of bookmarks inside the text. it is a separate type of bookmarks inside the text. it is also highlighted the jump to the next or the final springmark. this jumping brand is highlighted, so that it is automatically generated when entering a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The edit is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent features were added in & kile; important functions are added to writing a & latex; user source; special commands for their selection. under Editing You are included the following commands to the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If a paragraph includes a complete paragraph (group of lines, included on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning coincides with tables, latex; commands and all other lines of the source. this extended meaning coincides with tables, latex; commands and all other lines of the source. the only bent thing in & kile; is therefore the one that are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Coat the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also has an extended star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To release a part of the document it can be removed from this first and by wires the button will be removed. & Kate; offers the scanning process. & kile; offers its own commands to create a faster result. under Edit Remove the following commands may contain the layout of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of machining operations.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already illustrated that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for NF-specific commands under machining surroundings for an effective, simple work with & latex;</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command leads to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to set the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will scure the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to fly the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ 'command\\ begin}, the end of the stalls is injected at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many contatelted ambient command, this command will quickly go lost. this command conclude that the most recently opened environment, so that the scared ambient structure will not be allotted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups, which are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from machining surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will scure the current group at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in the clamp-shaped clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will scure the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly ring clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is behind or behind the curly clamp of a & tex; group # is located, becomes the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many splashing-curly groups-brackets, this command will not be lost. this command slept, so that the splashing structure of the & tex; groups did not dispersed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; are used two simple application marks as a grid. for the purpose of purposing implementation is used in & kile; the sign 'is used for two simple application marks. even for the filling of the demands, the sign is "used. & kile; knows this case and for two being close enough for & latex; one.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Though & Kate; already has a good source code performed, this in & kile; in order to include specific commands (usually for & latex;) still expanded. there are three different modes (usually available for latex;). all these modes can be set up for different working methods under settings kiosk... complete.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. the text can be entered into the detailed settings and in executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action you can use external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or use (or parts of the document). examples from & quantappointing; even are the quickstart dialog or the various see... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified plade allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir in the Command Line: global scripting folder: $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file will be removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only an instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is to control & quantaptation; used by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods there can be a script input of & quantaptation; at the default input can be determined, which is intended to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually advisable only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Accordingly, the output can also be diverted from the application. there are two types of issue: normal edition, written on the default output. it can be specified regarding the default output written, by setting the value of the box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the right toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use, activate the dialog "tag," if available, so that an entry when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igor! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select graphics and programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change it, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol is not only helping you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a boot button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as loose, stared, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user is signaled that Annodes this symbol a & lt; startup; -day in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it must still be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with setting actions... (in & quantappointing;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field is one button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and continue using other tags, so there are still, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaptation; functions to the toolbar or it should be dealt with in a better overview of some separators in several groups. open the toolbar can be selected using settings toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the cutting (all left) for my toolbar. after the selection of the item, which is to be added to the toolbar button, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to preview the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my work service, might believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be created in the right folder, but your worktop (s) should be saved in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar can be loaded (n) if a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the worth mentioning of & quantappointing; for the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; -documentree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantappointing; -checking that somebody has done this already for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second one we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentations HTML files = Section1.html = Sec.3.html pages = Section1.html = Section1.html &gt; = Sunday 1,html tag2 = tag2html - 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation in such a way:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html gearbox = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntactic .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that the subfolder is based in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess telepfe (except the reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the index directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top of the building view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not influence anything but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantappointing; resource-based & quantaph; resource-files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table-section is the section of the docrc file, which is to be displayed to the design of the context-text; for example, if the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array -function is to be displayed. by flagging the function name and slipping of Ctrl; H for context-help, the documentation would be shown directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">An easy list of by means of separate context elements which are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaptation; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web developers of the web platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantappointing; you are not alone. it is possible to share the following resources (DTEP packages, toolbar without promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise to whom. in different places there is a E-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantappointing; -users can download it. the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publication. in order to sign the resources, why there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When loading, you are asked for their Passphrase for its private GPG key (the Pasphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys, you can choose an exit. in the dialog's new resource (URL Preview can be empty) and click with clicking OK the Upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload the menu DTD DTD package (DTEP), which can upload tool toolbar, and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigating & quantaptation; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signature. in the event of any problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages and the resource correctly signed, appears a message with the indication of the author's permission.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, currently not by & quantappointing; supported to work by a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files can be needed in the day-XML format. there is the simplest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. after that, the following dialogue will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target listed by: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition box: the string that will be in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / WTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / se.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">The fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaptation; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantapSaul; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit & quantapSaul; therefore, one must first become familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter attempts to teach them precisely these concepts without their understanding & quantations; little utility.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapSaul; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantappointing;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantapSaul; available, available. from the toolbar on actions is all that marked as a globally, in the common folder structure of & quantappointing; it allows the group of administrators to ensure different workplaces, actions and patterns in the global tree, which can then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be done all by & CSS; patterns up to work toolbar specifically for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embedding a common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantapSaul; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editorwindow, the Baumanviews, the boxes with information and the toolbar. please fill in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the map of the map with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document passcodes, to load, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorarea lead to an additional context menu regarding the processed document contents, such as fundamental processing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing of under the mouse pointer of the mouse, help to the word under the mouse-cursor or open the file, when the string is marked under the mouse pointer of a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editor's toolbar you find the toolbar toolbar. at present & quantapSaul; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard to which a set of toolbar blasts is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantappointing; the toolbar can be adapted to the new functions and the related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert it into their document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert it one day that has several attributes (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanviews (QIT;) allow it to open and navigate to the information, navigate them and strip. in the presentation with cartels are available for files, project, sample templates, scripts, attributes, and documentation Baumanviews.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, the & quantaptation; provides. this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by means of right mouse-click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from storage media can be performed with the attached context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantapSaul; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web page & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are only usable for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more on templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script via the right mouse button, such as the script to start, edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one indicates the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on the cursor, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right clicking an element, a list of commands are opening in terms of navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other building views. with it, you can change certain attributes and namespaces. that allows to change all of the available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantar; from the quantaptation; 'document site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be customized and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quantappointing; two cartels at the bottom of the window will be reached on the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map showing information about each in Quanta current script. so, for example, the DTD used the current document and all changes to the DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map Leading all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantapSaul; scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaptation; toolbar toolbar can be extended and easy to understand. indicate a symbol and they get the appropriate command shown. the chocolate toolbar of the toolbar is the possibility of defining their own commands as symbols in & quantappointing;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantapSaul; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantapSaul; sends the toolbar as a compressor-archive through e-mail;. if they receive a toolbar at an Email, they can secure them in & quantapSaul; like any other, and invite you!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable as you want to customize the place of & quantappointing; -files on your system. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help one. the options are easy to understand and here are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantappointing; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantapSaul; is a web development tool optimized for the KDE surface. & quantapSaul; was optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; Editor to create, the developers of & quantapSaul; to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantapSaul; a peculiar, extensible Markup-Language Editor? well, this would make him the absolute greatest Web-development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, & quantappointing; well, is already standing on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. it can be defined in & XML; then you should define & quantapSaul; therefore the appropriate & IDE; for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be noted that & quantapSaul; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; Developer community is based. & quantapSaul; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & KDE; -smells is not only all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantappointing; to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantapSaul; allows web developers the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can extend the productivity dramatically. by means of self-coated actions, scripts and toolbar, automation is possible to remember almost any task. through the program commits you can remember & quantapSaul; (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; connected. the original developers completed the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More information is available with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Conqueror; enter, or helphelpdesk help: / quanta perform).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A fast access list of files you have opened. this list changes each time when you open a file that is not placed on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. have a look at the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project system's system, there is only one error reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting out the clipboard there special characters to the & HTML, delay, so that they are displayed correctly and are not understood by the browser as formatting guide.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; writing, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is primarily used for inserting & URL; s in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages can be ordered!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions in order to help you.</seg>

<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar icons on the left of the main window. this column allows you to put Bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When reading the bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next, depending on the position of the Cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantappointing; -projects are stored with file @ webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files are then copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory after new files that could be there. this enables to copy e.g. graphic files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; from and if you have any additional input / output module (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantapSaul; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantapSaul; projects can be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are kept in projector / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved through settings. your toolbar can be stored on the toolbar toolbar or you are asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not deletes it from hard disk. if you haven't yet saved the toolbar button, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar at someone (perhaps to the & quantappointing; -team to make the toolbar at the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbar on the main server, where everyone can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has done and convert into the & quantapSaul; its own description format.</seg>

<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people, the other OS-platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using selected & DTD; tidy by means of the external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switch between the different types of the user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries can cause the switching sometimes or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card box mode, which is also the default setting mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaptation; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains a entry for each open subwindow entry. with selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of & quantappointing; main window on or off.</seg>

<seg id="2154">& quantapSaul; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project, the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaptation; development in financial form, find them here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out best from top to bottom, as for example after filling the project to complete the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift, F7 project Project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaptation; project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with extension webprj (e.g. foo.hoprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>

<seg id="2174">In the subwindow configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event, one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantapSaul opens; the last project that was open. this behavior can not be influenced by default.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select the project... from the menu project or the icon project opening out of the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantapSaul; closed, the project file will automatically be saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving if & quantappointing; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management provides free access to the files in the project. you can manage the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder is also used, however, the entries are missing and open with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information about the place of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more of a profile is available, the button will be abed to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel memory and forget the program. this option is useful if common loading of files is necessary and that the rather insecure password on the disk is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantapSaul; many high-loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to several servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog displays:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfermentation protocol for the high-load. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your attachshaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but anyone with programming can easily see in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar toolbar. it can be done in a project of many views, that is, by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Opinions can be stored in the menu Project or the Project toolbar, accessible via settings on the toolbar toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantappointing; with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of & quantappointing; to the own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbar blasting in & quantappointing; best from the toolbar toolbar. usage and add is dealt with. adding the toolbar at the bottom of the toolbar toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar can be configured either via context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be executed, or the toolbar can be executed, which can be displayed in dialogue, where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar toolbar, the entries will be removed and displayed action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and set settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentette, code engraving and files to the linkages. & quantappointing; used templates basically like a nasty file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or each at the system existing in the deposit box. assists in & quantapSaul; in about the restrictions you set up for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantappointing; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template in front of the usage precisely.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Landfill is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using linkages (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on the Templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text file type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents are sulated in appropriate subfolders on basis. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text range always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the basic-tree under global templates. see in for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, folded in a zipped tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaptation.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure after exposing (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose file as a template to save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, you notice that (even if it has been stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project-tree. look at the default tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click Save File As a template to store selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily pulled by dragging and drafting to the construction management templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file is only to copy in a default folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and drafting or paste across the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in project files to create a folder template, select a name for the template and backup. by default it is stored in the project folder, but of course it can be as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow for a very target-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and footers, or dynamically with PHP; shapes, paste files or link with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The default structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / apps / apps / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of vessels as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the default overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu Properties. the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection panel with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled as soon as perterous attributes is attached.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all besides the master folders in the default overview. if a master subfolder would disabling it, it would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder would the blah would appear with something like text tree. if nothing appears, one is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you set up or set text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of summaries in a folder with special headlines / footer to equip a whole presentation with the matching headers lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (click on the right mouse button) on a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantapSaul; offers two modes: VPL; - Editor and VPL; & Editor's text editor that can be reached via the menu View. the first mode replaced the text text editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor is released. then you can edit and edit the source code editor, where the changes carried out in the VPL; editor in source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor to a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandadvertiser of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; however, the source code is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first one, except that the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor will be synchronized with the cursor in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor will be active, this mode is already active, the touch of the active cursor from one window to the other, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization spacing between the VPL; Editor and the source code Editor is configurable via settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -view one can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation can be set in addition to the time of time. basically the recommendation applies: a small detector for quick calculators and a large magnet for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, tools is possible to choose document properties. this is also called the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor. this is also called once a new document with the VPL; editor will also be created. this serves to change the result:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags, the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list enables the modification of the content, e.g. keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file-open button and selected the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the Cursors is as in a text processing, possible through because with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted via typing, typing swamp or extension.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The inserting of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar button, like in the source code editor. it is noted that the inserting of tags previously available already existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor day, is inserted with text, every other converted anchor needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some work boxes like the tables-assistant or the lists-assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for study of style templates. in contrast to other programs for style templates, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The conduction was very complicated because one of the contributory had made many changes and at the same time had corrected one thing in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. the interaction of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white signs. later, more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare fast text, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparisons window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way interaction will be fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot will display three Quell files in the compilation:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot will show & kdiff3; at the folder interaction:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Kdiff3; displays the exact differences and control the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check coding, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if lines are only different in a certain number of white signs, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble when someone changes the balance.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make yourself ease of animal work by simply writing the filename of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder-1 folder folder kdiff3 folder-1 folder-2 folder-3 folder-2 folder-2 folder-2 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog enables the manual intype file name, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the list. open dialog displays your selection and displays it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparing or conmerging of folders will be introduced. if for A file is selected, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When we merge together, the input field is active for the purpose and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately. you can also carry this step later in the store.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button will open a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the comparing / collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. the comparison will then immediately start. in open dialog you will need to select no files you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel 'button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop files: drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought lies behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would have to load only two relevant files, put them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present you cannot draw nothing from & kdiff3; only the case of text in a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors may interpret the draw and paste text into another program to cut and paste (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window there is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) E's Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over a while on the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source boxes are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the colour which file differs. if both files are different, the preset color is red. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summaries column. when differences were found, the color indicates the appropriate color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white signs are relevant only in strings and comments, for the Prevention and in a few, rare items.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which divides the abstracts column from the text, is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no line. if the default file is activated, the line is shown on the converted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparisons) has also a Info line with the wording output: the file name and [changed] if you have dealt the result. usually it contains the automatic assembling already text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, the storing is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the closest hardest / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference can also be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group will be indicated, where the group will otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic assembling or by manual editing no further line will be left in the group; then it's only a space-card for the event that you can change your opinion and maybe do another source. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; recalling code conflicting; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. keep careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers ignore or ignorant C / C + + comment, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the keyboard and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard on the right, right, high, down, side, side, bottom, bottom, Strg-beginning and Strg-end, Siw as well as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">At the exterior window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the paste button you can switch between plug-in and overmode mode. (preset is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries columns you will sync the view of all windows to the top of each group (as already in the section summarizing and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-Up), or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, it must be solved between solved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>

<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, for all entries the upper setting is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the commonds for encoding appears a short reference, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted as encoding. as encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have processed a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can set the coding of the output of pre-processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress the highlighting of changes in white signs in the text or overviewpoints. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignoring or ignorant C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a colored-coded transfer column. but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files. depending on selecting A & B; B, A & B & B; C; C is shown next to the normal still a second superstile column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. blending the less important window. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparisons by side or over-each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu).</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts to merge the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as the preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart it, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">While reading a file it is passed on to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible and not the file itself. you can write your own emprocessor that corresponds precisely to your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut disruptive parts or to correct the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="2350">While reading a file it is handed over to this external command (see above), then the command of the command will only be used with the compensation command. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds precisely to your requirements. each input line must have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to enable the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program themselves it. the good news is, however, that in most cases or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this precautionary subcommands to transform the input into big letters: sed's /\\ '\\\' s /\\ '\\\' s. *\\ 'is based on the found text in the first gear string.\\ U transforms the found text in big letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords in order to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion 3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command of suitable. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every following suitable matches will be replaced, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several rements at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the rements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -e -e's / REGEXP / replacement / Switch 'For the perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the default'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal user-processor will be kept for the display and to the operation. further operations only alter the data that sees the line-off-algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, when you use a normal Preprocessor, the line-off-processor sees the output of normal Preparates as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The embankment commands are very useful, but as with every function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can't notice certain differences but cannot destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers in a folder need to edit many files. for this reason you can compare with & Kdiff3; complete folders repressive and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for every object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the assembling and displays the simulated changes, without doing it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... executes selected actions with either all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge individual files. you just need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be merged, folder-1 will be used as the basis. if no target folder was specified, used & kdiff3; folder-3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start working together, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder will inform you a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed by then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown together. you can double-click on the + / - click on the object or using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all sub-directories and subfolders with which you can split up all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the cladding action will not be automatically selected. if the interaction result will be started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, are used in columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered as identical if its entire content is identical. then also folder the same color. at folders the age is imsignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf back, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. if A a folder and B file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the coexistence can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A a folder and B file is): error: contradictory file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the coexistence can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronisation is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and when the option directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical to the two folder. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as visible filenames for the output file only B; right after the merge copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of assembling (unsafe) activated, then examines & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the current date, then the date is identical.. If such errors are not eliminated, the merge the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merging, a file will be processed after the other. you state column shows heather when the coexistence was successful, and according to other reports, if something unexpectedly appeared. when the coding is finished, you should check out a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the furniture dialog the file is selected Full analysis, Kdiffusion 3 further columns will display. these include the number of parables, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldering conflicts will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the straight selected item (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all together-one actions (also in all subfolders), you can start together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a target folder, then in three-folder merging mode C will be used as target folder and Synchronization A and / or B as target target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory assembling / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to only perform the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through conflicting data types still exists, a message appears to be pointing to the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options passing, simulate and crash.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you want to see, if you first want to see what would happen, without the really make changes. you will then get a detailed list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then results in certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a merging window will pop up (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are ready with a file, select directory assembling, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, appears a corresponding dialog. then leads & kdiff3; his work with the next entry continues.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiffuser, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you choose to transfer it again (F7 button), let's choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you proceed with the result.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually merged, these entries (in the current session) and execute them at later execute all entries. even if the compilation has been translated or not saved, these entries will be considered settled. only when you change the merging action, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & Kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion 3...) now has a section called directory assembling with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary-tree. separate the samples with a semicolon;. valid bases: '*' and '?'. (e. g * .cpp; * .h). the default configuration is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders comply with this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. a great advantage is that this folder is specifically configured with .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files are a veraging attribute. in other file systems marks a leading point. this option makes you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is enabled in the preset.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When left to files: when the option is off, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When left to folder: when the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be examined and recursively searched. a link to a folder that would lead to a final loop and & kdiff3;) This option is off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executing a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unquestionable, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if they are applied to files containing no text. (enter a similar Anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare large folder to a slow network, it is potentially faster to compare only the changelist date and the file size. however, you will cost a certain degree of safety. please use caution. this option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to the changers date. there is no real comparison, if they are identical as identical. this can be useful for example when copying the change of change. please use caution. this option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the syncing mode if two folder is to be compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging will be identical. also, the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences instead of gathering the copying of the newer file as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file is not also changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets deleted. if an old backup file already exists with .orig extension, this option is deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal assembling of individual files, not just the assembling. this option is switched on in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder abstractions can be visible to the assembling of individual files; you can switch the window dividers with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the option directory and text window to switch the window on the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking it. nevertheless, in the directory menu, there is also a corresponding menu item. you can save a single file directly without having to merge the folder, and the file will not be done once again when you restart the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will however be lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiffusion 3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folder to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive of a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative undoder. or.. These are not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masking. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt; &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol it used. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be distinguished whether a link is shown to a file or a folder. then, a file will always be referred to as a link. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change the change from the original. (note the option to the size of the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently available as a difference in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences viewer. to launch Klamp3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in Klamp3Part from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiffusion 3Part II. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. in addition, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it supports only the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. all together or comparing folders will not be supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>

<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script will not be the correct prefix to KDE. in default, you will not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs are different, these lines are being treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is treated differently, the line will be treated as not identical. if the other lines are next to each other, this is is the case that this is is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor turns out for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. that's necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is however lost when the result is simply saved as a text file, and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort is so far too big. you can restore a particular version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, once the mouse pointer is a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people who pose sorns in an inaction (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse-clicking pain. besides, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arise at the clicking the mouse, and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, due to the simple terms of the mouse, you may apply to pain that is related to using your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps, which is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the account of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result may vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse-click, once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent verge is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause, after it will push the button of the mouse button. move the mouse over until the end of the movement, before the release of the mouse button will run. in this way, you can run the pulling button on pressing mouse button. the intelligent shoeing requires a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This haste must be duly after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smarter relocate switched on, the turning point is active (1 / 10 s) active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button waits before it starts the mouse button again, if there is no use of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow cycle saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt. it will be started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt for the first time, but it can be started later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears to be delayed, you can shorten their reaction times, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you can decrease to a lower value to shorten the score.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Is this setting marked, is started & kmousetool; available at every start from & KDE; this function is currently only available under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to launch a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings on the values back when opening the dialog box. have already pushed the button down, the settings will be applied to the state after the last pressing process.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best use you & kmousetool; first of all with preference. in particular, the intelligent Verpush you should start off first. if you then click ustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later use the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the antamount of & KDE; if you need to decrease sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window which does not display a link leads not to unpaid reactions. therefore you can park the mouse on these places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse buttons, you should cleanse your mouse. that is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse button but also the roles that come into touch with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse button. as this happens, from mouse to mouse will vary. however, it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. dirt and dirt can be easily scraped with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the version of & kmousetool; if just a failure is started. if you're in this case the intelligent Verpush, means that & kmousetool means, the operation is no longer able to quit the release of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; to use in another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform yourself a mouse-click. here, the status of & kmousetool is reset; reset and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, tries & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and moves the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor over there, where you want to have it. but if you don't want to make your mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you are unsettled reactions. secure zones for the mouse-cursor is incumulative; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I'm trying to work with the intelligent dipone, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent verpone is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very comfortable possible to copy and paste it into the clipboard or run any other action you want to move the mouse on pressing mouse button. but there will probably be some problems for you:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the intelligent touch if you just start to start & kmousetool; to use text instead, execute the Shift key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again instrumental the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. this becomes everytime when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when when the intelligent Verg starts the delay time. later you can use the smart tanning also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; installed. this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2593">Most TTS-Synthesizers offer different languages and voices so also different male or female, or those that are defined in volume or speed. you can also set out several variations for synthesizer. you should at least set up a spokesperson before you & desktop; use, as the program speed dispatcher otherwise uses the standard speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2594">Different speakers for the same synthesizer are comparable to multiple pressure booster for the same printer.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Filter for drawing system shutdown offer a good possibility in & tectts; wrong, stressed or faulty selected news. the file called kmail.xml sent to the delivery of & ktts; it is a good example. you removes the tags br and b from the messages, the e-mail sent, and also the expression / local / Inbox, as it can be accepted in most cases as assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts;. for normal work with & ctts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before he will be sent to the program Speech Dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace wrong words or abbreviations, to handle a suitable language and spokesman, or to avoid certain deficiencies of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program 'Speech Dispatcher is working with a text. & kta; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen transmitters has the highest priority. it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the issue of the screen reader is pre-read, the instructions will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor will be too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these jobs will resume after issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you want to read a long text on a website, you can enter with & kmouth; someone who just enter the room. & KDE; notifications are also news. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you encounter from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that have text orders. text orders are meant for the edition of prolonged texts, which do not have special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are worked in queue, except the output of screen reviewers. if an application sends the output of a screen controller, while & kta; just reading this issue, this issue will hold and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen retrieves. you will apply to normal warnings, messages and text orders, as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. these parts can indicate either as words or as a regular expressions, provided by text or as regular expressions, which allow the use of chat-motivating messages like: -) by text or for formatting of messages from & conversation; or & b-mail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Tformer uses a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to a different format. within the scope of delivery of & ctts; are some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; in SSML contain.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Interphone filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & desktop; if you have set a female voice at an example, you can read text from KDE messages about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has adjustable rules, which it is applied to a voice output. when the filter determines that its rules does not exist, there will be the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & KDE; notice is sent, it will be edited by all activated filters available on the page below. editing by the filters are in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This indicates the list of the furnished normal filters. the filter is not enabled, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed the series from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of the filter, and it will be shown below the following furniture dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If you have a list of words or regular expressions, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference pattern. these patterns shall be found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitutes.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. this name you can choose any number, it must be distinguished only by the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replace it in accordance with the string of the column. the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the stated word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to store or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries are attached to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">Here is a value registered, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-ID-run programs get started with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers, you must weave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only have to input.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The palette of the text filter is applied only to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box dictates filter when match. are all input fields blank, the filter is applied to all text.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words the colored filter controls regular expression in the form\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by separator (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; expressions, you can call it in the dialogs Adding or Edit and # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions are listed in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc can be reached via the ambient variable PATH, is also xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the intercom filter, you can send texts to a certain spokesperson who is set up on the map link, or to a speaker with specific properties. you can specify the example that texts from a female voice should be read in.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & writing; a text appears to the filter, it looks for a spokesperson for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker of the text, the program highlighted, and the characteristics of the speakers sent on the map Speech. with the speaker fasteners, you can overwrite the chosen speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value registered, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. it is installed on your system of the & KDE; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; expressions, you can access it with one click on the button to get help with the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, d. h., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Set here the characteristics of the device you requested. if the text filled the above filter conditions, the speaker is selected that matches the desired requirements. click the button on the right to indicate the dialog box.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a language version. this standard includes labels for control of voices, the microphone speed, the volume, the voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation by abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & C; SSML only supports partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You will need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) because this is the standard voice used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival file dialog not on 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional filters (SDS filters). SBDs also submit text into individual sentences, as only the first sentence should be synthesized; therefore, you can also cancel or stop the whole text order. this allows you to also cancel or cancel the map orders either directly or recede, even if the synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the typology filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a provisioning filtering filter. you can alter its settings or add further pertinent filter filters, but it will not be recessed with it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the speakers by typing. place the speaker selection once more. check the speakers again, change certain properties and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. for this, you must of course have more than one presenter, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>

<seg id="2731">You will then be able to stop or cancel text orders on the map card, even if the synthesizer this function is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal pertinent filter filter is automatically set up if you start working for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just removed. change nothing about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Characteristic filter filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a table character (decimal number 8) to the propositional part (decimal characters are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard typing filter filter will be included.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-Filter will never be applied to & KDE; News (kon), warnings, messages, or the output of screen redresses.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from Versee the normal extension bordering filters, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card side, you can overwrite the speakers for the application. the map card is displayed when</seg>

<seg id="2741">Mark this junction box when the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when stopping the issue, this property is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this property. the only case, in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language, if you know that a certain application text is placed in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area speaker, the closest to the following is to be deleted, click the button button, and then use Speaker, who is in the best to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2800">The & Cnetworkconf; -package has been developed to allow users manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kmonitor center; to enable users to create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by choosing a kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & menu bar.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & Cnetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must have already been functioning and configured, so that & Cnetworkconf; the device is at all attacking and setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed in the installation of & Linux; installed and installed. network devices are later added, the drivers have to be loaded according to the following files, according to the kernel version, will be loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded, if the option is selected to set network settings in the &-controlcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network, this system is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release population will be best. by marking the setup non-once-queries the definition can be made permanently. the next start of network settings will then automatically set this option.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means, the settings can only be viewed, the Changing is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will proceed by clicking the button of the button. it is required by entering the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of button to set up the button and set up the dialog device.</seg>

<seg id="2815">It should be assured that the IP address is not already used in the network. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. coupled with ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on, depending on the need or switch off an integrated network device. it can be activated via selection from the list and clicking the interface.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS backup is replaced by the appropriate IP address. that is necessary because computers can only understand IP adresses. if the machine calls http: / / www.onedomain.org, DNS detects this name to an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine to create part of the rider list allows an easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNA entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and up or gradation in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">An alternative tool can be used with graphic user like a package or an installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and KDE; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changed configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about incorporating the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 never found large distribution. by IPv6 it is expected to move through in the near future. thus, this description concentrates on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to point out which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the contact person who doesn't want a valid IP address, or if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When inserting an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from one specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address objects with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, the addresses are usually used in the domain of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the mmaske is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so that all other machine participants are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special items, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Zweite the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for IP redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The PS7.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP-traffic in the local own machine. usually the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files are shared by & Cnetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes modified at DSL connections, so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than fixed there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the securing files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select Shechem...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can examine even the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog displays backup. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in any of the files in the entry for the disk. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkup process was started, the dialog displays Settings for checking. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the desktop folder.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can import the restore, the files that are to be restored, this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives which belong to the belt work. it will only be restored the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from any of the archives with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or a folder in any of the archives, and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process was started, the dialog will appear for restoration. in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the desktop folder.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog will be reproducing. this dialog displays progress of the recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the index.x file using the band's contents. this will deletes all existing Indexfiles for this band. you can regenerate the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This concludes a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings. you can make for a backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be made. the list of securing files is updated automatically according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, is that only those stored in it are stored on the same filesystem, as the folder. folder that are stored on other file systems, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files are saved, which have since changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine changes since the last incremental backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all the files to be backed up and a new snap file for the next backup will be created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings may be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path for the device file (usually / dev / Tape). this path has to refer to the non-recurring variation of the belt.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & date; before the tape is included the command will load the load to the drive. with some drives, this is necessary before reading and writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, trying & b; the executing with the belt work to lock. possibly this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when loosening the integration of & ceps; automatically the tape is unmounted. do not use this option on floppy Streamlines.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, trying & b; the hardships support variable blockages to change. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you will need to inform you & a, in any case the block size for your band's work.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & D; a band is formatted it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should occupy only one block block on the tape. the content of the file is composed of as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is billing: seconds, while calculating the complete name of the system is, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which has passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdate /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar-versions should work as long as it is not concerned with incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup database. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& Ssystemlog; is a & KDE; -spectator for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files. in addition, & a system log; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& Ssystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystem log; is an easy representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system is deposited in the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & a system log; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions, which are filtered and evaluated with the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a system, a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, provides & soundsystem log; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, we tried to log-log; first, the most important protocol-file of the system - the system Protocol - it will not display, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you have a log file system. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or to filter strings. the list of the log files will now automatically be displayed, so that only logs box contains the selected filter. in the default setting, the log box contains the filter for the selected filter. then a protocol is only displayed when one of the columns contain the character string of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. for example, the filename column appears in the appropriate column. for example, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so you & kfillog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are shown with a showy color as protocol lines of stage hint. the colored presentation of protocol lines can be switched on dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can skip the option to new lines, in the context menu of the main window, to display all the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& Ssystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subjects. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on the display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& Psystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.org. Dort you will find more information on the sources of sources of & ksystem log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& Psystemlog; in addition, you will find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archives: - Systemlog; in and KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V init Editor, more known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; in this section a few concepts introduces and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init quickly develops to the standard for controlling the program of running when running the system in the & Linux, world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD init system.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go down here on historical aspects (among others because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binder is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps anyone could try to make a machine on System V init without a reinstall and reformatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.synerit and the following more folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want when entering the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such matters such as setserial that only once started. such Appeals belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be done on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for this. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d when you want to run smoothly, what to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel will search in different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the pre-established Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you want to change it, then you come to repair, by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter it in rc3.d, you will probably see something like:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you find no right files. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to any of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: any of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & win; a server Runlevel, which lets only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user Runlevel, the & #; & kdm;, Network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointer is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of Available systemservices on one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or adjust the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this happens when the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this does not happen if they draw an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area. to copy them only to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select from the edit menu or paste from the context menu and paste it into the target range -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can once again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Notice: currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different workspaces (disposable system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry in another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by pressing the entry button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise it will be saved by & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln standard, and now the machine starts continuously. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for performing under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Deliver (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without notice when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information on the Runlevel so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & cuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & cuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save this. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry to be saved in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& cuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and user list. for editing, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it will appear for the dialog user and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only when you have advanced system settings, a card map will be produced on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd will be installed in BSD settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password appears if shadow -passcodes or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD - Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least a built-in file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, although the space restrictions are specified in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system individually. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space-restricted</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which the user is heard, can be found in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by mark those in the great field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties tab contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the Add button 'button' button. edit or deleting the selected user or the selected group will be analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-BootManager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time until the control of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, modify, change, change, and more.</seg>
