although I had visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
as many of my generation I grew up with American films , I danced with American music , American writers and running his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily determined by an American film journalist .
when I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d , who covered the Supreme court with judges , who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free after meth@@ od Man , &quot; mir , &quot; as if this is the absolute truth , everything else is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only ever strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very strange love story written about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
a lot has been written about xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his engaging @-@ minded .
he never holds behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
however , people react to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that one was ever achieved by the party nom@@ inate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ est person I asked me ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his elec@@ torate when I met Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism program that took people from all over the world , a deeply glorious person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
moreover , Tru@@ mp@@ s World vivi@@ dly does not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I had hit us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy T@@ ahr who fought her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
she still fits her with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise coun@@ sel helped me a lot of my career .
these people and those with them em@@ bo@@ died my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp continued his way to the nom@@ inee Republi@@ can Presidential candidate , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people for Tru@@ mp have agreed because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were ready to over@@ looked these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as the r@@ amp@@ er .
the people decide , told one of my friends , is exactly what led to us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most know are , for Tru@@ mp , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who urge the cruel decision to raise a man who desc@@ ends with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look differently than he did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m altitude ) : so much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging out of White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as called the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people all over the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is always welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Kenya , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
yet with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise , and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm again .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bro@@ ods the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ est a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a one @-@ voting and vo@@ iced &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now tru@@ mp land , told the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and that is breaking down my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ as city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from nearby Indian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays out in the municipality : one out of children and adults with existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchest@@ ras , offering their musical instruments an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and banking force .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth always provided a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , means the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI .
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
you always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ub@@ bu@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ k , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled material :
music with re @-@ made instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ i@@ ded violin , viol@@ a , cello , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , sax@@ ophone , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were all manufactured from the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank S@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician &apos;s teacher , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same point where parents worked in the rub@@ b@@ ish . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed to be a f@@ avi@@ o something that he never had seen before : one of waste @-@ made violin .
today there is an orchestra which plays on instruments of recovered material and that The Recycling Orchestra is called .
a documentation named &quot; land @-@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) offers the musical performance at :
the world generates around one billion tons of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these ost@@ African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that dominates the wild illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is done within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time it was known that this ship had already been operated in Lebanese waters of illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries have thus expressed itself accordingly and little incl@@ ined to welcome a Legisl@@ ative of this kind on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised itself rapidly against the ship . they em@@ ailing him , one of their har@@ b@@ ors , and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries , which you simply ref@@ uted everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ isheries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch the fish there .
ultimately , it was also obliged to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pl@@ unders of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protect resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop illeg@@ ally stop F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ishing ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . you exchange information and stand each other on where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ating F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition un@@ regulated : what is caught , it is hidden , because it is extremely difficult to absorb it . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
due to the obvious dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the screw stamp , with the information between individual countries , thus the actions occur nowadays in real time , with track@@ able at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , individual countries can share with each other , for example , interact with existing licenses , news on suspected activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very attentive when they move around the open sea by means of satellite .
this allows the authorities to mark ships which can fish in ver@@ itable areas . also , this susp@@ icious driver to discover - about those that indicate that a ship attracted its fish fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies might show whether the participating ships have a fish license , where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports . what does the ships not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers from pen@@ alties , as in the fall of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , conduc@@ tive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultation company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already named platform was created to get estimated 20 million USD in wast@@ ed revenues that lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate to East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive Th@@ un@@ fish oils , present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . under these two illegal fishermen .
among other practices such as actions count as the sailing among false flag , counterf@@ eit@@ ed licensing papers , st@@ ating fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ completely organised control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ing my harbor not to walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is temp@@ ted F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now to close .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had participated in more than 30 investigations disgu@@ ised ships .
it has detected crimin@@ als which had lo@@ wered counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that have several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties used and it has fle@@ dged ships per@@ sec@@ uted and found .
because of its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the International Food Safety Authority , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized by organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to exac@@ erb@@ ate ships precisely .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , helps to split the illegal ships that &apos;s like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships also turn on their automatic identification systems , with which they cannot be more of satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information levels . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch , together with Google and the Marine Reserve Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown worldwide by means of each individual tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only a crime , but also terri@@ fy them .
ships used earlier without license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisheries sales , fishing boats and more licenses purchased .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped to split Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing networks whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa annually , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight against illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the aim of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia reported its first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road with false flag . and not only the ship was on the road with no licence and became the to@@ w network that is now banned .
the ship was also penet@@ rated into the bel@@ ated waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking place of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proving that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . he writes them on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their article will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is breaking up : demonstrations in several cities with the target to conquer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela appear to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government led the opposition from the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans denied the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into the empt@@ iness , gathered together on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the appropri@@ ation of Venezu@@ elas ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central part of Mé@@ ni@@ ob@@ o and Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated on what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the minister of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the cancellation of a re@@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ising in their latest article the context of the government statement as follows :
within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and th@@ ein@@ ation are among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and farther @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine is considered to be the only way to reg@@ aining its institutional structures and to conclude a new government alliance .
the electoral bloc of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or a brief MU@@ D ( e.g. : round table of the Democratic Party ) , called the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly ; for example , the trial against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos; was initiated into the Way as well as a march to Miraflores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government office , on November 3 , should continue to pers@@ ist the blocking of the referendum .
the call was commented on Twitter as well as comments :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ ally civil strike and on November 3 all went to Caracas on the Miraflores palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the Programme of Action &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezu@@ elas &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures from the Mär@@ klin , which are published in real time , testify among other things a large participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also struggles with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator , who calls through the protection signs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ am this Venezu@@ el@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter are imag@@ ery pictures that tell of conflicts as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the message over pol@@ ishing suppression in the central @-@ north @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators were trying to hold the police forces , including these women in the An@@ de@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear tube , because you could see something else what many nation @-@ gar@@ s do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already making the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a state @-@ of @-@ issue procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innum@@ erable people on the street .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ ze claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your salvation @-@ recovery !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and rather than pre@@ occupied , critical voices are dealt with : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adap@@ tion version of a interview by Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on August 23 , 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ in@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was obliged by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city Córdoba .
as the end of the adult man Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the office , the same name as his father contribute to the brutal military battles in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
34 years of long , he held the secret of family for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a walking @-@ magical .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated from his father .
at that time I could not realise that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ tur@@ ers and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ aments . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Secret Services Department , 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
Archive eup .
this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who was indi@@ cted for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who recognized the extent of atro@@ cities over the years , who he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for itself a path of salvation .
of the sports hall for the military base
as my father he began to take me to the military base , I went often with us to the sports hall . there I had a boy with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all called it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend .
he said ,
you are a hole , you have rejo@@ iced with one of the ERP friends .
pass only that they will not kidn@@ ap your day and I will save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ ative ERP stands for Ej@@ i@@ c@@ ito Tur@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - The People &apos;s army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Labour Party of Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me with work on the military base .
he told me , I would become en@@ vy .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had brought me up .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - were standing .
everything from it was stolen .
he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
this day I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were par@@ ked and supported me with an guards .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I approached and saw a song , tor@@ tured on the people .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal fe@@ ather .
later I found out that they had to attach it to the end of a cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body that was just there .
they rarely get a man with hand@@ shake to the bed , over@@ poured him with water and pursued him a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the genit@@ als .

the rock there in there was terri@@ bly ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , he came the same smell from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I wondered : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tivated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were attached .
he talked to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of mattresses , on which naked people with the face down - all were cap@@ tivated by hands and feet .
near the entrance ch@@ un@@ ted people silent on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What Are you so , ass@@ hole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I encountered , &quot; Why have you brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that , because my father told me about it .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero brought a man there and killed .
( according to the survivors of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indi@@ cted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ( death ) .
the following video leads Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former Fol@@ ding chambers .
the way in which you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped here came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the order from the top came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - of eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the out@@ lay of men and the dis@@ appearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things to home .
at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ rep@@ ute &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was later at the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - was clear to me that war spots were a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sign that one takes an enemy who fought one enemy .

but if one walks into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war @-@ be@@ ware but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is rob@@ ber@@ y .
I always asked myself how my father , who could join the head of security forces in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply do not understand it .
I was also officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do it .
once he called me a criminal , and I answered , And thou that thou sa@@ west cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded before anger , suggested me and crying :
if you walk so far , then I will find you and trans@@ duce you .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I had a jacket and a wheel pul@@ sing from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still took clothes to go home .
at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators have been with this crime . I refu@@ te no problem , they can put me a burden on what they wanted .
I was anyway there to greet you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the squ@@ ander@@ ing of the body is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you first have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ ek@@ u@@ ated during the dictatorship of human beings . but what the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply brought them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their corp@@ ses leave ?
did these people not also families whom you could pass their mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the tigh@@ tening of the corp@@ se is the last pic@@ able act which man can do with a person .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and somewhere ent@@ ails - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought to display my father was born during a conversation , as he was under house arrest .
I did for@@ sake him because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly called me and asked me , for the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which allegedly defended them , actually well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you did not comp@@ elled to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only resist@@ ed me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely what I did .
2010 I re@@ funds the first ad .
at last I realised that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me that I am taken up . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under arrest in May 2015 at the arrest of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : under severe , un@@ lawful freedom of liberty in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 @-@ year child .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the span@@ ish order of the order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended between March 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court made a long prison sentence and in nine cases per@@ pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was one release .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by am@@ bles . # Es@@ war@@ heads
all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military forces , former police and civil staff members .
Piero De Monti had been kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ humane heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. which represents the children of people who were mur@@ dered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research was 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argent@@ in@@ ean government hosted the country on which La Per@@ la was built , so that there was a memorial place there , which is now led by human rights organizations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; an interpreter mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frigh@@ tening car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend his leadership .
the photo was widespread in social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his leadership in the last month of witnesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ei@@ r sh@@ a ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; - perhaps also with bu@@ ke h@@ ind &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be found on electronic advertisements in the input field and in the building itself from September 1st to September 20th .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the error was like the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ otos . he was also aware of the local time @-@ stories about it .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n daily wrote :
&quot; how could there be an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to the elderly and in an international city like Kyoto simply &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hol@@ mes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation has been removed first . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Post@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the good , if gram@@ mati@@ cally is not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , they stated that the bug had already been included in the text that they have received from the translator and that the translation has not been tested for their correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the excuse :
&quot; we sincerely felt that older people felt off@@ ended due to insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents , but is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example were generated in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 from a total of 19 460 accidents from sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors picked up 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increases its share of 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of the accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the named re@@ por@@ ters brought in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently circul@@ ate against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo has received the following comments among others :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; so bad is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error . &quot;
there are not only such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in whole Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true ration@@ ale for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for crossing , one needs two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native language .
thus , a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their native language to complete translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the reason@@ ing , grounds or relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies who themselves do not have foreign employees , have translated translations nevertheless to operate independently . then the Japanese employee , whose english knowledge is considered to be the best one , for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
automated translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ alled and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases which arise by machine translation , show that this technique can still not replace a human translator . this is especially true for several languages .
some of the wei@@ rd English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often bl@@ amed t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood nothing at all .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the town of Kyoto uses a reliable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored measures on the internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Surf ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an internet users that they have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV could no longer be accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ed recordings of the protests in Caracas that were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who res@@ ists the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and had transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author with Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cr@@ app@@ ed , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it appears that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an provider is again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with internet access , especially in periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ating in reporting about protests . at that time the Commission was concerned with tele@@ com@@ ers and lock@@ ers when they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amaz@@ ingly that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ re Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online transm@@ itters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly has its meetings .
former post@@ ures of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNA . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains bad .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server is incorrect or denied the request at the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ i@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who took live the protests in Caracas .
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in a police force .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has to regulate the Internet connections : so the Venezu@@ el@@ ans the access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on current events in the country is always more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls will ens@@ lav@@ ed to get education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have just been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ dish that is made by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not together with the family who lived there , eat .
shortly before their university degree , she returned to the university again and heard how the owner of the house was filled with pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
the one has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , people are known in Paraguay that are more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money out@@ gives their minor son or her less year old daughter to another , rich family . in exchange receives the child food , training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that children have to accomplish countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract , which one cannot lift up .
as a Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice , it is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies , researched and increased .
she tried to call the things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ adi@@ tas , is guaranteed to be silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who is her daughter in the faith that they will improve their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of himself , to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes the girl with him and jus@@ ti@@ fies its exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the so far relatively unknown phenomenon occurred in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of intense stro@@ kes . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ s@@ Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials at the resident office .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ educ@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometres to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ an society rooted in the practice of cri@@ m@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest and called for there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the E@@ ne@@ ars and almost 60 civil society organizations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be landmark , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before judgment .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the bull being worked in which her father had to compete , compete and her father lost his work .
their brethren now had to go all work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , they had to divide the time so that you still have time to rest .
she stood up against 5 pm every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
Friday for example , they puri@@ fied the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and disinf@@ ect the floor .
when the school was ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they finished with learning , the more free time it had .
but even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had to never hunger , but got also not unlimited food . I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ tically of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some branches of the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand next to him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ists like &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held them for intelligent , but he did not talk with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened , while he talked about politics , &quot; says she .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would stay there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they argued that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which would belong to the Indi@@ genous Group of the Guaran@@ tee , to speak at home once again their native Guaran@@ tee .
their Lord feared that they had the formation they had made to lose again , explains it .
but it was completely clear , however , that for everything she got from them , had paid off with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , are bullying and the ra@@ ils that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me at home . I had no friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friends arise , I particularly noticeable that I was not one group assigned to one group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society pays the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group in which you can view advertisements for Rein@@ ig@@ o@@ ez@@ al and Kinder@@ n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the administrators of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city portrait in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please log in .
begin on Monday , if possible .
the display was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a first @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , I was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country of the country that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the fi@@ bres dropped into the ad once again :

the business was complete .

in the course of our history , we managed to create systems like slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) with which the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores had been kidn@@ apped and the system of the Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers had to be considered as semi @-@ slaves ) , and the system of the Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , in which they will still go to a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social inequality in Paraguay and that at the show of power are key to understanding the phenomenon as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bill post@@ ures up Egyptian users of social media to register in government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legislative acts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media have to register in Egypt with a government office to make use of social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that has been instru@@ cted to give citizens a permission to place social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , they would have to register users and users on the site of the site with their right names and recruitment numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it failed to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine @-@ bu@@ ster with it .
the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ids and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others using voice , video camera and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose the user and users the registration . it is unclear how the Egyptian government should not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and promot@@ ers of the Legisl@@ ative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received by the telecommunications state as a user name and a password &quot; to get through the firewall which blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to get a firewall at national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to access information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts from experts on site are scep@@ tical at the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; guiding research @-@ related research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly to the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion they imagine that just as they could be force@@ ful of physical public and private spaces can be done online as well .
when I take them seriously , this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of men and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not at all realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft needs to be discussed with the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and its constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft will be maxim@@ ised in accordance with one pro @-@ military reason@@ ing in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that there is no dis@@ sent@@ ing Nar@@ ration on the picture surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legislative act against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those envisaged to be guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ utz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the fierce leop@@ ard Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the bigger family of the Leop@@ ards , which goes through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only surviving beasts in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &apos; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is available .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards is actually to be seen in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore determines that they all have a shot of a great cat at the camera clothes , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
as a liter@@ ate Bi@@ olog@@ o , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their land , which is not only made of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and in educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advocates that protection zones for wild animals can be set up in the Kurdist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o highlighted the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the &quot; D@@ reif@@ ach catastrophe &quot; from March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , which is in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a real pre@@ fecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the consequ@@ ential ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring towns of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were pregnant , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report from the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows the progress made after six years to rebuild the local people .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese re@@ building and survey results of those affected .
the construction situation at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( type of pa@@ stry , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were finished in the Pre@@ fecture Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could see Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is with 70 percent final light .
however , one still stri@@ ves to settle for six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ ab@@ om@@ ers ( H@@ iz@@ e@@ su Y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the D@@ reif@@ ach catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated dating from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in this context . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated accommodations , who have been for@@ ested after disaster in homes , have been spot@@ ted in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ates the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by un@@ happiness until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been put into operation at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y har@@ b@@ ors were re @-@ recorded .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have held large @-@ scale farmers in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 per cent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land at Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic force , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares were destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear locking zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered again and recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still left behind .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can only be 75 per cent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated inhabitants . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung writes :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population in experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed said that still enough is done enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es .
how it is for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in her expenditure on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous devast@@ ating earthqu@@ akes and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , dis@@ astro@@ us , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ hima from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were somewhat more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , which have been laid out for long term buildings .
after the stand of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
in disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas , who still have to return in Beh@@ el@@ ab@@ ella Hau@@ sen , older than 50 years old . they have to compete with massive constructions for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a matter of construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo .
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people encounter people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , one often recognize that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global compounds are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strong with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa looks like the love of music worked for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa looks like the love for music the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences which he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in Arti@@ ficial Kom@@ a , after having been squee@@ zed by the police among nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack on Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 has returned this week in the intensive course : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide participated in millions of demonstr@@ ators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors offered him this Saturday and have now moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the images there is also the face of the police officers to recognize that with a stroke grip . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the police police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that Samp@@ ai@@ o had been sus@@ pen@@ ed to the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a polic@@ eman held by a demonstr@@ ator and land the Inten@@ sive Care , would his face be seen six months in television and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Luz in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary blocks briefly on it .
another video of the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective is also applied in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) in order to be part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .
by : H@@ eit@@ or Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado call for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist police was formed by his father , because he was campa@@ ign@@ ing the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who is attacked by a polic@@ eman , who has attacked him with a stroke .
police handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil that has been the brutal police against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen were engaged in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and po@@ tions .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Order ( P@@ SO@@ L ) asked the police via loud@@ speaker pass on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media is distor@@ ted by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo also reported about a cerem@@ onial glass window to shape with a photo their front pages illustr@@ ative .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a story @-@ story with a set @-@ down bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window @-@ off than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause , to report .
this must also recognize if one is strictly against any form of state damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here also the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holds an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are inter@@ viewed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters at the front @-@ fron@@ t@@ ational course with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba from the ab@@ duc@@ es forgotten villages in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso made almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western province of May@@ abe@@ que is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of it that there are no native sugar harv@@ ested locally .
it is two years ago when the activities were planted in sugar cane factories .
after the end , the sugar cane industry was silent in the region , and the factory was lost , and after its installations , until only the smells from steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes rarely the work .
other res@@ or@@ ted @-@ design@@ ate and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that gr@@ ind yet .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the su@@ gar@@ be@@ et factories , who are again in operation after a long time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad directors and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced amount .
the news could have been a mo@@ tive for the land a few decades ago , but the poor harv@@ ests were no more .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the cr@@ ushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic need : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they just left the factories that can produce sugar for the maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise in the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose before about a decade back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural tools &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production of 2001 would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tons ) , the pipe export would earn about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day is to take into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
during the following years the st@@ agnation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million persons were given their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
so that the place is maintained , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first big year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially registered documents that would be removed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , which came under the addresses and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ tra@@ Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to authori@@ ze any empt@@ ying .
the responsibility was taken from there and the letters have always been more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money for the remaining sugar cane fabri@@ cation in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the still@@ ness of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of employment .
the most developed industry @-@ area between Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that have been produced in the communities within which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h talk of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of those who looked like he had guaranteed that for the area , whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would work well .
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 the sugar cane has to be extrac@@ ted only high through Mah@@ len .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they started to dis@@ assemble them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the area , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working .
Ne@@ on@@ und@@ forty inv@@ ests the old soldier a r@@ ents of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month , in order to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is no subsequent person , yet he gives the lies he told him , not .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Youth Day use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they do this by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , the workshop manager mobile audio studios have to teach directly to schools and youth centers in order to accommodate young people song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were guided by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree @-@ Communities and then working with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p Hop Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop is thus raising that young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever is found in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ mon@@ um First nation in British Columbia told , for example , the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; tied up to almost two dozen of the most indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the moti@@ f of a video game to im@@ part , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people are not able to dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ magical stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation have recorded , the refrain in C@@ ree is sung .
the people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group who ran them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an is available the st@@ rop@@ he in writing , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like would not ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth for my days
that is the day when you take our cry !
because we lost our way to life as a youth
but I believe we will rise up a day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad living
this is how they can grow and go forward to our youth
so they can do what they chose the creator .
in the comm@@ ent@@ on , the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also gives an article and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ cript ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :

to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed in the entrance of the entrance , are issued near the entrance , &quot; Plastic Mod@@ els of the dishes &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at this plastic menu and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the making of these plastic meals .
in the part of the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes , who have documented the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic meals are usually so common that they don &apos;t even feel more striking at all . however , a new trend is turning into show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual twist with the sho@@ ots .
now on sale : new with plastic @-@ operated cell bands , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ ebo@@ arding , as in this case , refriger@@ ated magnets :
here are a couple of sho@@ ots and magi@@ cians for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom of ess@@ ays becomes increasingly recep@@ tive .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don was converted ( a popular travel case with seafood ) into a cell @-@ stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a cell phone .
we have also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo .
and here is an apple where your mobile phone will be holding :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
this is only the beginning of a growing rush into the com@@ ic .
some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon uses , a popular t@@ opping that will be served with white rice .
on Twitter a few users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; are there someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WOW , cool , now I can put my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic surgery can also take a less appe@@ tizing shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also motor@@ balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ belts made of dried sal@@ mon .
other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # or on any type of view .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you insight into the neighborhood K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who dedic@@ ates you to the sk@@ e@@ fer@@ ing of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ots san@@ to@@ va .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the Ver@@ mi@@ sts and Dri@@ vers regularly dive only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this battle poses itself .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
in the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks upon the sorrow or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone of bone in the hundreds of the heimer graves , the stories of innum@@ erable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r c@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug @-@ trafficking &quot; ) , which aims to give these victims one voice and tell stories of people who work in the fight between criminal enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal P@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drugs , and whole municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) telling exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who looks after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who in just one day her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have put to us and to graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are at the assurance of my father , but that does not pay her out , because that demand a mort@@ gage .
where should we get the ones ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co , &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who pose the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fragile and the state of state .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexican .
your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , regardless of what form they are occurring :
disease and sen@@ ation@@ journ@@ alism know I have been around for a few years now .
I &apos;m coming to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images , which can actually only be derived from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me from the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is hal@@ ted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider it normal as normal .
it continues on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he is s@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when it is great . and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the criminal , if they go through the streets .
for me it is that they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of that something happens .
I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c will be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ sensitivity of people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the forced leave of 43 students be justified in a neighboring village that they have &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to speak out that they will be spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months &quot; s@@ press@@ ors in the main city : &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als had been lo@@ oted by their business until after the end , not only the business was destroyed , but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
the pain about it never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear came back high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers as well .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap you or to kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot about how to crying . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one by force ma@@ yed generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions of how : who cares for the child of a mixed woman and a man who was mur@@ dered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other men of his age , whose parents worry about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ ans and he tells you had to teach himself how to make a egg cooking , potatoes t@@ ows , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water , sugar and milk pul@@ sing .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy which consists of violence and had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been over for two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father saw by armed men out of a squ@@ ander@@ ing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw the following :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , Ju@@ á@@ rez , the most vulnerable city in the world , according to the number of Mor@@ de according to indications of the Civil Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone the Pro@@ sec@@ utor was en@@ cl@@ oned 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who are leaving the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those that we may not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Wel@@ journ@@ alism 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug dealers , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades in an understandable way .
when one picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he linked , includes pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a ru@@ mor or fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the years after the first time sur@@ faced ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was dec@@ ep@@ tive to use trage@@ dies , which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny not the fact that there are abundant coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it poses questions to our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a gas @-@ carriage venture the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . at the same time , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest land had been neglected and devast@@ ated by Africa . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of stroke which were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gi@@ cally fell victim to the gas station to the victim .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses envel@@ oping , including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who fav@@ ored the football stadium .
houses conf@@ essed and disgu@@ ised corp@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the con@@ fession .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users my@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ multi@@ ere photos of the incident form the gray @-@ loving scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows bon@@ ded body that are aged on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years , the same photo has been re@@ ed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , com@@ bat@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am the remote towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye @-@ witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and bodies were burnt in streets and bushes .
there were reports from which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one fell back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be displayed .
the reason for the attack also un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ erian and trying to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo has shown again , as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days from Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo has only one number of mis@@ understand@@ ings ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass evaluations .
a further step further brings personal comments such as this example mis@@ understand@@ ably the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to furn@@ ish arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also joined in Myanmar with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee , rape and several deaths , some through combus@@ tion .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , such as the following , who brought this descriptions with photos from the Democratic Republic of Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab message page which , in 2012 , claimed the President of My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to show this information .
the original contribution that was accessed by the last on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations who sc@@ anned AF@@ P as their source , were also mist@@ aken Th@@ y Th@@ y His statement , but had not associated with it the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false put@@ ties suff@@ ice up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turned images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed Image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the said picture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
they come from a mis@@ ch@@ mas@@ ch private site , platforms social media and Community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , others have tried to expose the counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have identified examples for the impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , on which side they were published . by doing so , we want to be more clearly visible than through the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) several examples can be used for ab@@ usive use .
here are some cases which can now be felt completely out ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
samples of fake cou@@ plings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ ed countries indicate either side or server , the examples of ho@@ axes or false messages are still available .
the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that are available according to metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City did not only explain the false message , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo relating to Nigeria and further questions concerning the intentions of the persons and the tr@@ apped trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nig@@ est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the ch@@ r@@ istian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as his source the Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( which is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ posts according to the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this here , who used the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; , have clearly seen no pages such as ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faul@@ ty use of the picture since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , at that time passes through a post of US American , anti @-@ Islamic comm@@ ent@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

this article refers to the continued hard@@ ship of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but c@@ ites the work of an article of Indian Express with the image from the Democratic Republic of Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this picture during the time of publication of our post .

on the case of any type of recorded case , the functionality of the fact that any type of cap@@ s@@ ows upon recei@@ pts is able to find references . &quot; ( warning !

this alleg@@ ation was postponed by a Greek Fac@@ t@@ check @-@ page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim over the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and widely used the image of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from the Democratic Republic of Congo was shown as a test@@ ament to the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for the impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , expressing sympathy from Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre and on the other hand a blo@@ ggers which are per@@ sec@@ uted , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , as the photos were mis@@ used by it .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a resolution calling on what it was seen as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this formulation , which is exclusively published in English , includes also references to counterf@@ eit images of sc@@ aff@@ olds , used H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and take on the other ( which is often circul@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post that directed itself to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , presents clear that the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo does not show Muslims , Christians kill .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar is saying that the President of Myanmar was involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of publication the picture continues to contain .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about Stud@@ ents who had been converted by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted message page An@@ ál@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declares that the picture does not belong to the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ ashing attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dune &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , followed by a discussion among Muslims following the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ u@@ ousness in the name of Islam , have paid a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ed as proof for the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were picked up in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting , compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alleged to have been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre , translated this discussion , like this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the false statement .
from the message that was included in the image from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of an incomplete use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
at other accounts , aggreg@@ ates and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in Gra@@ u ) points out ink as well , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with ur@@ ls and time@@ - / data stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and inter@@ fere with images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya ; )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original return of 2010 , the picture ultimately carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that undergo these Po@@ sts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion wants to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth studying how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers are no longer able to believe these pictures any longer .
with social media there are sixty people , the un@@ inten@@ tional part of having the water around a tragedy .
suggested this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and nar@@ rowed it the real crest of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
an argument is that that with@@ hold images of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognise the tragedy . at times , these images are even required by the victims himself .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and audience have des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which studied how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there are some with regards to violent representations in the news media there is fact that they are indispensable for current news reports .
techn@@ ologists experiment because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture appears to be suggested that actually , but also resolved by the context or on totally ab@@ usive style .
however , every investigation of false subsidies should also take into account as internationally as they can .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of small languages
photo of Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to provide language @-@ inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese de@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Ar@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
however , all contradi@@ cted stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have already been collected in an online list for quite a long time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist chose from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ esque language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - No@@ tice to your parents in recognition of how we have tried for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ ze catastrophe of the decade .
the island of Sri Lanka is currently one of the worst flood disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , are characterized by strong rain , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shores .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka , May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and just hundreds of hundreds of people are inter@@ ming@@ led because of floo@@ ding and mud .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe areas of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were gradually left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters of some areas went slowly back .
health and sanitary rati@@ os of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood water in Ta@@ j@@ ama city with water conditions up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am ant and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kas k@@ nights floo@@ ding the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eb@@ rise rise , war@@ ns save the Children , after some rain falls already on the way .
today , the clo@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday &apos;s water@@ way of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the air @-@ monkey has made five planes of rescue operations and further five are made ready for transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their floo@@ ded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also various organizations and start@@ ups have declared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and life@@ guards you require for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to dry foods and life @-@ necessary goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the App so that the Cat@@ alogue Centre is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ p@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed the users to pick up a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free to the s@@ lan@@ c@@ ian Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat hired actions were included for by the floods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , people are in need of emergency and help tackle them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kas is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality lies .

the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend .
I trust her four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ce .
in one minute we are calling for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next process we are right for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain @-@ umbrellas and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ic image of a woman with a head to@@ wel , tied from an American flag , other sket@@ ches par@@ ole against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girlfriend looks to me and says : &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; I ask .
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in their conception .
it de@@ es me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we are practicing our religion .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim genre .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , the as I do not fit into it , mus@@ cular .
de@@ Muslim will become
thus , I stand not alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
to peace ?
as a blinds , Rum@@ i as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and jel@@ ly .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is has been deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the most reduced images of Muslims , Western books already known for centuries .
this entic@@ ing image is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman that you should save .
the landmark Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was breaking the story behind these pictures in the 197@@ 0s .
but these images also stand out further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood per@@ sec@@ ted them .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ os over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not once again choose their first female presidential group .
this Nar@@ rati@@ os fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dering their head office in public buildings and to take aci@@ dic women through their government to cover their entire body , which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group carries out his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ rati@@ os weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken of African soil from Afri@@ cans who were so far brought down with slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslim .
this Nar@@ rati@@ os has occupied our collective imagination , so deep and flaw@@ ed , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the destination an@@ tim@@ ony attacks and ra@@ ils .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we share it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia today is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to reach the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry fails to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest level &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant &apos;s parents arrived in New York to live her American dream .
my mother lay her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American Colum@@ ns from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan had re@@ figured out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were w@@ aged Muslims and Americans .
but now I am not against the Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I am not a pig sav@@ age , I say - instead of getting my mus@@ cular recipes or make my hand@@ ker@@ ah@@ or@@ an , whom all Muslims take in themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all pick@@ pocket with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to get almost always selected for additional security ch@@ equ@@ es at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists that seek to fight a prevalent lies of Islam .
these lies are produced to the ongoing tape of a well done Islam@@ opho@@ dies@@ in@@ ates with l@@ aces , Th@@ ink tanks and experts for false information , which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and due to the nature we tell , consists of Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger , who under@@ takes a woman by the head scar@@ f .

approved use .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when Social ists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor , my neigh@@ bor , see my rock in the bran@@ ce , that I could see the Muslim , when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ent ritual with my daughter , when I ho@@ des them in my arms and you can cl@@ amp the Arab verses for the protection of the Koran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask you that they are protected from the evil one , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim fai@@ ths is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal part with her sisters , as she began to win a competition of the art of floral decorations in Kar@@ achi by decades .
it is the image of her that I can see in that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can almost be maneu@@ ver@@ able .
Muslims means to speak the prayers they had said to me if I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims lie in it as she has attached to me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; has been colon@@ ized by a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ ini@@ dia &apos;s company , it has a profound meaning , God , to name my only master .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather is crying .
nu@@ ances while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ f@@ aded for his family in the India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who have affected their families , as in my grandfather , by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
Muslims signi@@ fied to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have de@@ colon@@ ised to four Muslim countries .
this means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected a Muslim country against a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ rors of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it implies remembering that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful army of the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , have gone into Iraq to pursue mass destruction , which did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the su@@ icide of veter@@ ans has risen in 2001 by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy has ha@@ sty the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story four times more will be reported than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that four@@ teen years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , created by a liber@@ ated black slaves connected with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ abad called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X to a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .

the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a sp@@ am@@ y , but is represented in the reduction of the du@@ sting . &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot;
a mother means to be a mother to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are building up to this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim registr@@ ars that began President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer , which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ Fly list , &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
it is the wars that we lead and the bom@@ bs which we throw in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically un@@ correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as of evolution .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to mis@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints , which we engage in our news actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims inside the media industry , which tries to grasp our frequently cont@@ ented identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global stage , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences , going out over the 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now that the White House now lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ entially because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is still another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not yet given them ; now they dominate the large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of as I was so old as it is now my daughter , but which today made me an irrever@@ sible Muslim .
things that I left here like a bread@@ cru@@ ising in my speech .
things that may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sections which our humanity does , likes a story , where someone will be made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , constell@@ ations take place in the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

these are however no terms with which we usually throw in our schools or that we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why would I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people mis@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades of himself .
we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions according to the role of what is aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because there is no president in which we have no president who bom@@ bed the chocolate countries , while he has already broken down &quot; humans &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , from Flickr @-@ users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the result of stories in their original language a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices has recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to children &apos;s children .
for the creators of the project :
the mass of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , take the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
while &quot; listen often often related , &quot; these events will instead &quot; hear &quot; these events instead &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to make . &quot;
in this format the stor@@ yt@@ eller tell their story first in their own language and translate them into English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and representation makes it possible that the audience &apos;s access to it .
they give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round takes the stor@@ yt@@ eller of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of Cre@@ t@@ art .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork from the bun@@ nies and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having explained the importance of his nav@@ el , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide crest , he shares his sense of incl@@ usi@@ veness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
you were quite at me !
up to now the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States D@@ ign@@ ment of the State debt
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , who took up to 72 million US dollars , took part on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations at a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ zz@@ ori@@ ex@@ ican Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ go@@ an .
it was called by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ amt for the neur@@ as@@ tical of debts ) and the ec@@ com@@ ic Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the ren@@ unci@@ ation of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os are calling for politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their corrupt .
we call for a financial examination and a mission committee , without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions of appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favour of the economy .
we are pressed and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be found with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated into the sovereign territory of integrated territory of the USA - suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; proposes a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party membership with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the outside , we rise from the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he did for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference held on digital culture , which is oriented in Berlin , is devoted to an event of # Free@@ Bas@@ le @-@ campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a Wissenschaft@@ lerin of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ner , Business leader in book spr@@ ints , a publishing house by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , las@@ en extracts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive Discovery ( The cost of freedom : a collective night research ) .
the book , which has been published last year and is available here licence @-@ free , contains a number of attempts to deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book will discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is connected .
activists , artist , designer , developer , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have side to look over the fog that surrounds our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create something sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and gu@@ essed Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the Ad@@ ra prison list , which he sat on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push to his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us can begin to think about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been operating since March 2012 in detention of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra @-@ prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sperson N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , told that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; drawn command of the military attack from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it to be contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who submitted himself as an insi@@ der of the Assad government , and inform them of a alleged death part against her husband .
his residence and state will remain unknown .
pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ le played a crucial role in extending access to internet and knowledge for the surrounding public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment over@@ wise the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ es cultural prototypes are predic@@ tive than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the intersection of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with hi@@ es@@ ky traditions and Persian influences .

I have spent my entire life with it , of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
ba@@ sel brought me English into even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read English well , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners , English to read and speak English .
bas@@ sel gave me the door to technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet upon me .
he has also attached other prisoners , such as they use computers , at least theoretically , without making them one in their hands .

that I lose the spi@@ der in the moment we embrace ,
that any of the haz@@ ards is no matter ,

if your eyes may say good
and I will let another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness .
to return all the moments ,
and to smile about your absence and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protest 2011 the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ ky Network for Human Rights ) more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared in non @-@ violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption dep@@ uty director after release there again on forec@@ ast@@ ed post
Mos@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted to a corrupt regime in which a government member returned after half of his sentence . he returned to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is a form of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years in prison .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 was established .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , which happened on 19 April then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Pro@@ sec@@ utor of the Republic , which claims the application , there would be no obstru@@ ction reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ refer to his old posts as the company had no discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t have the action good .
the Center for Public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again :
putting an envelope in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and even becomes a step toward the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that even the company should have en@@ forced on the in@@ discipline of discipl@@ in@@ arity .
however , the company apparently appears and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and where half of them did eat .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and rest his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company which he helped to cause damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be for its silence .
contradi@@ ct@@ ory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ ra , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says , the director bes@@ ses no morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he ins@@ ulted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already destroyed so massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead he serves only himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ ler to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was forced and eventually condemned to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
Di@@ ebe belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el in prison , not only for ever as the first independent president to be remembered , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - side by saying - proph@@ etic present@@ ers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he energ@@ ised to be &quot; a ambitious person for all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambitions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person will change , my experience shows that he is not so . he does not alter the tactics , but he turns not to its ambitions .
a ambitious person is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rej@@ ection@@ able :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and came free .
and today he sets up the company , in which he funds un@@ cont@@ ented , again under agreement . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - out of these funds ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017
Em@@ ild@@ o Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to dt . : @ Truth ) presents that crime in Moz@@ ambi@@ que pays off :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ alter@@ c@@ se .

according to information from Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their post@@ ings from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to link to people in East India , or generally speaking as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or on any part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma during the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely descending con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslim who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight with hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with racism , but the word itself does not pop up with a hate language .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the purpose of his use .
moreover there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with some different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also contains &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written what the same letters contains , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ier A@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual nature whether they could bet , just as he could soo@@ the his back pain by making a word play .
the sentence ku la - &quot; Healing &quot; ( ku ) + &quot; Healing &quot; ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that she must decrease hate language radi@@ cal@@ ary nation@@ alists but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it spread all posts to dissemin@@ ate racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
there fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the Automati@@ atism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words by side .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( alter@@ c@@ ages ) .
the good is that this three @-@ dimensional nation@@ alists dissemin@@ ate the fran@@ k @-@ language , a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everybody , the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will begin a kiss and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung My@@ ath described as Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; from the social network is ban@@ ished :
... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the Word is locked .
iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was sorry , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post office &quot; The Facebook community standards did not ignore . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to portra@@ y their opinions against the hate speech radi@@ cal@@ ary nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinions about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are poor .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before starting the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these words to cens@@ oring will only bring more hate within the various communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore it seems as if they started it without local context or technical support and have forbidden as words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the sus@@ pen@@ ned Po@@ sts .
if they had only some more respect for the 15 million health benefit , they would have a great turnover , would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now on Facebook funny and write about the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not within the context of a hate language to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the net .
here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Po@@ sts , which contained no hate language , but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese Text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ edi@@ tary y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out whether Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot is used with permission .
&quot; post &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot is used with permission .
in the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to bro@@ aden their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks , acts in the communities in Myanmar , in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have been forced to escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring the bal@@ lot of hate speech to his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides under control .
but rather than simply cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to concentrate rather on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the marriage .

the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law which aims to offer this practice , so that the mar@@ in@@ ous age is now at 18 .
prior to this amendment of the Law , some members were held out of Hind@@ i and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country assembled that the state does not mix up , as that , age , not the maturity determin@@ ate . &quot;
this happened irrespective of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN @-@ Kinder@@ Convention , who defines the min@@ ors , every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children had already been married , in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 per cent , and with 18 there were 8.@@ 1 percent .
2011 confirmed the statistical Office of the country , that of 1997 @-@ 2007 has been married more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys below 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to create laws to children before followed , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ guide for example had no concerns about the critics of the children before they should say , dam@@ n away for their own affairs . &quot;
this sort of religious opposition ass@@ or@@ ted for tensions in this really complicated matter , and some point out there came doubts as to whether the opposition would dis@@ agree with the law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the stro@@ us - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children of childhood was adopted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one was decided against it .
after having previously been in the Senate , the draft can now become the law .
the majority of the social media users was enthusiastic because the laws on the h@@ ehe was finally changed .
Facebook @-@ member of Lo@@ vell Francis , who held a Minister of Education in the Education Ministry , said :
it has all too much time and unnecessary talk , needed to wear the core of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now and that is almost any price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to put the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the law of law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which h@@ ears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted ,
the mar@@ in@@ ous age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious con@@ fes@@ sions 18 years .
the draft to the change of the German law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives , and 35 of which were present at the vote .
all members who oppose , have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s to@@ e is no longer allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ age@@ .
many thanks to all activ@@ ist who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
yet , a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of months Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to dis@@ solve his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the general state attorney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj could go against the law , the majority of social media users , you would have to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as generally speaking , in a way that we invite the state in our bedrooms , &quot; simply targeted about that , that the state , our daughters against them are being mis@@ used , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
yet whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where children &apos;s to@@ e are legal or still the norm though there are laws that they may say .

by mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can view on Wikipedia content

created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey un@@ locked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia .
day after day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information and to share .
both students as well as re@@ porter and fans of TV series are blowing against the block@@ age .
although a lot of technology @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use orbit tools for blocking web pages ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ biggest VPN pres@@ ences of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ ob@@ tainable from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; society at Harvard University has been held since 2007 , after the internet law has been adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked there are several mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , acting as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so calcul@@ ators computer connections ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is not able but can be retri@@ ev@@ able .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in terms of sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and it is just about screenshots and no Live@@ or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .

a ne@@ al @-@ wildlife @-@ photographic photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ cking rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with bad positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors .
the motivated him to carry out a camera itself and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring an international arena to the international stage .
and his homeland is right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , ste@@ er the attention on Nep@@ als .
he described on Facebook as he helps his first @-@ class situation in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photography ! !
I sat just at home , when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father to be a Leopard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the Leopard was , and I immediately began to cr@@ ush images ! !
Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to co @-@ operation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as a nature and wants to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as horrible as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already tiger already from face to face to face :
a tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the be@@ acon appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and He star@@ red me through the s@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
please take a look at the bottom of some of these photos .

a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men within the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ Cin@@ a by a s@@ lei@@ gh , and ch@@ ased by their family and the village community after having mentioned a marked relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives also do not call their wives , is also common among men . however , they have far less ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not come from this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ ser in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club with and were thus quickly became the main @-@ orient@@ ated topic of the city .
it is a place just for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ arch@@ al .
when one of 56 clubs , there are in 13 Indian states it is a part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and advocates the reduction of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working with the help of its video camera for seven years with the help of practices , like children &apos;s hei@@ r , to the ex@@ pedi@@ ment of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs .
they report how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambass@@ ador of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini was in their discussion , was of women , who do not name their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
if they do not speak out loud the name of their hus@@ bands , it is a bread@@ making , whom they have all imp@@ aired and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered a rear , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition has been so deeply rooted , that we never thought about this discussion group .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband , until now , at home , try at home as it works .
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband are not long until the video was ended .
Prac@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name it from now on his name .
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some felt it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the Round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection attempts to put the discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked us all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ eding of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she only went away during the whole exercise ; a different decided to allow the whole past frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adrenal@@ in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , having broken with an age @-@ old bread , the women decided that they were actually trying to call home their hus@@ bands with the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ mother she became star@@ red , she got fear and told that there was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which illustrates the E@@ igh@@ atus :
why do only women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red spot if he was too .
he laughs only and I listened to him to carry him .
the other women have not completely abandoned , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to carry him on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on any discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who could hear what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; she danced and spoke about things that they had never thought beforehand .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have seen some things , for example as our identi@@ ties have been linked to our hus@@ bands , and never talked as honest .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion group we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only supported Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ary c@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ants ; they have not dar@@ ed up .
after much dispute and discussion of the advantages of one &apos;s own choice , morality , connected with the sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ded Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them .
next they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will do it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed a little , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles :
we have done so far only little steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and are not members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women bear now at any time of Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ag@@ gle for more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ eness - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
one of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman is going home and reported to other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .
the correspon@@ dents of the video Volunte@@ ers community come from margin@@ alized groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News of those who experience it themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and provide a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development . &quot; &quot; &quot;

f@@ arious men are wor@@ ported and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that glorious men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que could be target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of sli@@ ps people for organ@@ ises , probably for aber@@ ration , is troubled by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government has now called a number of operations into life to stop the Prac@@ tics .
at the beginning of the month , three men in the district of Mil@@ let are killed , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ be@@ headed and some of the organs had been dra@@ ined .
two men were arrested and expressed in succession that the organs of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi will be used .
it may give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a glass of gold contained gold contained in gold , explained the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher from Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia on the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on gl@@ ass@@ ed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the purpose of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purpose is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country had conducted a mission to examine this Prac@@ tical .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighboring countries of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que trips from Mos@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritu@@ alistic ons@@ lau@@ ken , warned the Mos@@ ambi@@ que police following the latest assass@@ ination of three gl@@ acial males due to their height .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ le , where the mur@@ dered mar@@ es were arrested .
Hus@@ ky Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , Student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ans in the South of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that local police are already in the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ acial males .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of glorious individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably aber@@ ration rituals , has taken into account the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims would have power , the riches of wealth .
in the last days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Saman@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty with Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I would like to be ashamed of E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , where people would be ashamed to give them to the streets , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or lam@@ adas for super@@ se@@ ous purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim aimed to achieve passive wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ t hum@@ our have not been missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter utility , twe@@ et@@ ete , as well as the polic@@ y@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both sli@@ ppers are :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably was made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his attorney ended at the end of June , that he had been sent to hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years of prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after joining the charter of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that the democratic reforms in China was demanding .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has outlined the case as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ person telling it to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
uni@@ zed nations
po@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Li@@ u abroad a treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer any questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was granted to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government rus@@ hed to do that ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ umed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the sal@@ mon after China , since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously damaged , the Nobel Committee did his hope for a unconditional release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u , to pick its price in Oslo .
due to its adhesi@@ on , he was not able to counter@@ act its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
the peak diplom@@ ats of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us on the 30th of June :
we are at the same time , that China elev@@ ates all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us Wi@@ fe as well as family members .
they shall meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us @-@ Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; wish him the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot;
a speaker at the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy on the Chinese authorities release , not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of her house arrest .
the invitation of the U.S. message attracted an angry response from China , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and to make un@@ answered comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as free movement and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim loud Chinese and judicial system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff R@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the Chinese government to rel@@ ieve Li@@ u and his wife uncondi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o uncondi@@ tionally so that it has known itself into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German Chancellor St@@ effen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; took all of the medical support that he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex could ad@@ owed the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambass@@ ador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for providing adequate medical care to provide us with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ ani@@ ans told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia that could visit him every day but the police always over@@ looked the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Li@@ u , with someone outside , including his attor@@ neys to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada invites China to protect its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to protect and release the rights of these rights .
France
France &apos;s foreign minister called for China in a Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , irrespective of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and his family can have contact with him .
although the news @-@ sender France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that you will find no further information whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
the Council of the Hungarian affairs in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release a greater tolerance against those who call for peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ w@@ anese leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic progression Party called China also to allow to allow local li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave us that many asked him to pray for li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Dec@@ ist Association of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is it , whereby most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we may be different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , you hear that we are ultimately no country .
it sound@@ ed so volcan@@ ic , it had the semb@@ lance of an escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , is it then ?
the reasons were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given its , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democr@@ atically .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers to give democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it adap@@ ts better to its power .
in the end the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , there were answers to his American guests concerning our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he answered appropriate questions with no @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to make his opinion a clear , as it did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , thus to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take care of this point , provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he pointed out to the cri@@ tiques in order to read the whole co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the trans@@ cript
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the elections in Singapore will be so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is obviously not meant to be in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is the leader of a adol@@ escent generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am over what the Minister of Minister of Singapore said , very much ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that I expected - if I do agree , or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure whether he believes it is true and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sets the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; repar@@ ed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ udi@@ an account ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go the sovereign rights to the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and town .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is of serious importance .
why do the av@@ ows do their military service , do they defend their city but not their land ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment certificate ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many immigrants ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; said I then . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live back and back in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by providing personal questions .
on my vis@@ as then usually follows the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans bo@@ il perhaps in@@ war@@ dly before anger , when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other that .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that differs us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible at their ru@@ cks@@ ack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
this was how I started 20 years ago to travel through the world - prior to Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and before 11th September .
Canadi@@ ans have always supported small organ blades on their luggage to differentiate themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
Equ@@ al marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously have to say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forgiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposedly regarded as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I admired .
it would not account for me if one would change me from Dallas to Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is basically to be spar@@ se - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but portable figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has an own Canadian double @-@ tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter .
being harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn attention .
this can be something good when you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background away from the things that pass around one around .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a prime minister of Canadi@@ ans is .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans are not often talking about the fence , with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au then joined the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada pretty much sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band for Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band in Thailand has released a music video that took the jun@@ ta that took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of their promises , continue to print the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them his girlfriend makes him his girlfriend .
although not politically , the Musik@@ video refers directly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days this video was shared on Facebook uploaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 seats .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called for the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that have per@@ si@@ sted on some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ si@@ sted in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ ical section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the com@@ mander of the army against important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modification change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are seen as critics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ ambiguous provisions will often be used by the authorities to adhere to activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , the online content , monitors and persons who have been thrown , the monarchy is b@@ ander@@ ed to have been prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ins@@ ult ) .
on 20 May 2014 in Thailand the war was right .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that follow the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase their decision to buy @-@ boats , although san@@ itation they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video even it is shown how people are thrown into a black delivery carriage before going to an inter@@ ne@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they supposedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and they are threatened , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost @-@ cities in eastern Asia @-@ Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Reg@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and will appear here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ se@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ th@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ch@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ massage baths .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ sin@@ Asia as well as spirit @-@ cities .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived , today there are only a few hundred people in these host@@ ages .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
the bare fifth floor blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically set for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fall and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it hur@@ ts to him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory of buildings .
people who lived in this place once lived and made their contribution to the central planning sector of the Soviet Union , have left the district by now .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ se@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ev@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , one det@@ ects on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover myself with the camera in the hand , they immediately drag themselves back .
&quot; our mother banned us that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was simply forbidden , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for private use ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get to the rounds .
the District management provides free candles and bread to the villages in the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will make zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
some ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jun@@ c@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ le Asia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not like to accept financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports their young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas Monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives .
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit ourselves .
but we cannot do so constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neigh@@ bor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you said , we could get zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen but we will get zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation talks in Nat@@ asha was living together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminded of the co@@ il in front of the war .
despite the relatives , which live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ le Asia was simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillar ) in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still be something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it re@@ bu@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child allow@@ ance for every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ al pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ h@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells that at first a very frigh@@ tening situation was when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it is more to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation incl@@ in@@ eth to the end a little boy was over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy j@@ ailed him .
he plays with the ball , which rolls up the hill .
a group of children now scre@@ ams the ball .
while running , some of them throw stones at the dec@@ aying buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which care for in@@ integrity in their lives .
you do not know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses &quot; migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article from Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old , a small woman with a cor@@ als pink Bri@@ ll@@ ery and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form .
it is called the Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on a journey through .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with high @-@ grade , ab@@ usive walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ an immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , told woman Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons .
you would not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines which they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that gained from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) by Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very affection@@ ate .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , she hopes to arrive to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to stop normally a first stop in South America and then moving towards north .
the family had heard from other agents of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel together the circuit and that , the Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his guide , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a builder on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer team .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sold SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket for Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests often send their messages to text messages when they have gone to kiss them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explained that her Christian faith may be the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have contributed to her to prepare her chickens like in Ghana .
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it is not the only flaw for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is pol@@ ishing and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are too expensive too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment are 25 people there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after being lived for three years , he was moved out of the United States after a raid on his work place .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was bra@@ ked in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press out from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula it was asked for an accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ known , has offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the courses , the travelers consult calm their phones .
a minibus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about her house is full , but she also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ mother sn@@ ake them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair bl@@ ers that took her a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she gave her briefly to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats it each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang citizens are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Tian@@ shan district of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi on 10 July , in which it indicates the District government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Communication , it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but k@@ ò@@ n@@ ested the authorities use the App for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private @-@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine and trace the information and distribution paths of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ers and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend online , and to remot@@ ely control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it .
this introduction is in harmony with other measures aimed at controlling the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital air@@ ship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , printed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet mi@@ xes .
this based on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( anonym@@ ously ) , the aging messages published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police officers the residents dropped as a result , then checked whether they were installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected on a check@@ point using a device without this software , you could be det@@ ained by up to 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
you have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are meant for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by rest technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( both tra@@ v@@ agu@@ ars ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the identi@@ fier requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computer and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city party , to minimize the dissemination of illegal content .
all governmental , administr@@ ations , and with the party , including universities and research institutions , are required to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when running her computer and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation laying down to all residents and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable disks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards to register in local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action is viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ alties for a number of other possible delay , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single plot in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane reveals his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you are completely alone in a place where all the Import@@ ant has disappeared .
everything has dissolved itself and reveals a truth which is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has be@@ aten in a list of emotions and expressions , which do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you get the reality again and you are behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters in being turned out of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams to death .
all doubt can be solved in Rauch and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth continues on the axis of the we@@ dge . it becomes clear that you are caught here between the walls , which your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have captured me and my father three times , but this doesn &apos;t go , so I mean &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by demonstrating even the simpl@@ est concepts destroyed , which we knew .
five young people were buried during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough so that the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; sh@@ attered .
all the bor@@ ough cov@@ eted to , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I did not meet high demands on a city that is op@@ ted to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night the things had cal@@ med down a bit , after the power supply in the area stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of my house from crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradi@@ ct@@ ory through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we Con@@ feder@@ ate to a beautiful image that fully met my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in Ger@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go back - nothing can give you your voice , after you have left the whole way up to the office of the Security Council .
I arrived there .
the upper gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his males ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s hear me how you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are just brave enough to write enough if we are not close by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes were judged on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re sad to see me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with the courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my case , as I said , &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice for yesterday again .
and I think I never stopped to look to you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest time that such fatal consequences could have for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in single and His Father just with this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this sanctuary lies me up to the present day in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a past@@ oral torture , which I was exposed to a monthly .
I scre@@ am the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the yard and into the second office that leads through a course to the individual cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I sto@@ cked the room .
otherwise they have dealt with a larger cell at this time .
I have to share them with only one pair of prisoners and may immediately sit down without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the be@@ amer left the cell , and I attacked on an old @-@ established communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first det@@ ained &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me ultimately .
apparently it was none of the surrounding cells an important man middle aged man who sees myself like and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive face can be recognized by me , and doctors are not there here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers can be found in its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would not leave him if I abide .
li@@ ars .
I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ s to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear it &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
it must be approximately 10 am in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens up .
I was always convinced that black was the paint of the destro@@ yer , until I presented the yellow light that introduced us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( i.e. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
in this way the secret was paraly@@ zed : to protect the state of security before us and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions and conf@@ essing the close vision field of their world view .
this is not a house , which here is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I had cared for the audi@@ ble room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a sl@@ ender , and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the face @-@ im@@ prints which he ent@@ ailed him : &quot; my child , you are still young , you can start so much more important in your life than to join this diary and to protest to protests that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to me , not to answer .
I can no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and be@@ atings have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to pun@@ ished , even though I had nothing done to make this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to rip me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your cry .
give it the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your horror .
my fri@@ ght fell not enough to him , why they inter@@ ro@@ de the pipe through a cable .
in my first appointment , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or whether that was to be part of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ connected to present us the one , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them change , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling inside my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard hearing .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and I found no favor , which is why he made next to an electric loaded terminal .
flow throughout my entire body , enough to feed my entire neighborhood .
my half @-@ blow@@ n body , which was spread out on the ground was the perfect electricity leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been so at midnight .
I decided to lay down again sleeping ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours went away , that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning is meeting the space . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my Father must make her fear@@ ful concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and walk you , you will move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me back ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the most of his time inside ; sometimes he l@@ ates on his canvas , sometimes to his own computer , to his couch .
but on what one can rely , is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belongs to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine that they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ a ( e.g. Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old tried and proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like ori@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but he also asks the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that are rich from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind through limits , and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not have access to the US American foreign policy a particular a@@ version .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas , something to do with his identity as a Palestinian fle@@ eting of the second generation , &quot; even though he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he is poured out in water of the nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . in this time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli law also ass@@ ays that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a mu@@ g of coffee on a sensory hot jun@@ k is little with protest against Islam .
basically the battles of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the sh@@ ad@@ den of the k@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of liberty .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially if one thro@@ ws a look into the neighboring countries .
thus , it is simply ignor@@ ant of doing basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to land in order not to land in jail .
recently , the Department of Ministers of Jordan has announced a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Commit@@ tees of Action - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man , Ham@@ ed Mira@@ o , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert band . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the former press and former press @-@ press in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just had been canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents an ancient legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a said the j@@ ord@@ ani people as &quot; progressive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might not be simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but actually reflecting itself more clearly and cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work clearly .
in the year 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards to be ly@@ re by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have prec@@ ep@@ y sex .
the image shows the Skel@@ eton of a apparently lower un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of innum@@ erable women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them .
over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ des &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 , however , that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to seek the victims mur@@ dering mur@@ ders or domestic violence .
according to a law on breaking action from 1954 , women , who are suspended at risk in a familiar violence , &quot; at in@@ definitely time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from issues that long as tab@@ u in his country as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b for@@ ested that his work is political , however it adm@@ its that he is his music , which is full of explicit reference to sexuality , freedom and expression , but not by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann .
I became a policy @-@ like , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the assault . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b , &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one , in his words , &quot; that can get what one wants &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that barely anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans talks and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still highly cens@@ ored until in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme Ro@@ ya in order to later remember that his comments from the context was torn down , turning and his opinion was cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but has only been given a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b openly for the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still remained in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will ask : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century was able to write about homosexu@@ ality , why are Jord@@ anian war not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ ani news recorded several former government officials and members of the teacher , with the reason they had expressed themselves on comments in social media , expressed deep in the country rooted in deep in the country .
in view of this the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs is therefore only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the plain of Jordan .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a now for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks long , careful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ani society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he dre@@ amed not only of being his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region is characterized by music , art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , transi@@ tions and arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally @-@ run democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until the time is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to have passed and therefore also make resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
this great , extravag@@ ant war pu@@ ffs are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ect that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas To@@ ho@@ cus . a further theory implies that the harvest , the drums and the tan@@ go over more than a thousand years came across to the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to catch a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( pic@@ t@@ l .
I &apos;ve been looking for a Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two pr@@ ams are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and yet to spend a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high for@@ ci@@ ation was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this history , because they help the Peruvian youth to keep away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dressing .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us is the most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crimin@@ ality where street noise and illegal drug stores are every day .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to becoming more norm@@ alized in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles , which can form these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts will compete against each other , to show who you can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to learn their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice in hair @-@ style , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities that do@@ zens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special education workshops prior to March in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only professional school in the church and the district , where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this education community .
Columbia : love of the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the revised version of the news message to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love connection to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel spreading , affection@@ ate with affection ?
exactly this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , which young people under@@ signed letters , guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare .
only recently , their land was a venue of a historic event , and they wanted to help their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ descent F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which marks the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was the sign of the peace treaty as so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its for the Nobel Peace Prize .
but in front of the Kolum@@ b@@ ans , there is still a long way until you can talk of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , which had lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and round about the clock their weapons will have to integrate themselves back into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again , which in turn has acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of suffering from guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , it must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian people were convinced that the young colum@@ bian has to come together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did as well : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love @-@ messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare - which should then be handed over personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá . Leonardo and Cr@@ istian was able to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , write thousands of love to write , but those who need them need much unnecessary .
he plan , he told us to share his love with people this year , which was most urgent .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former com@@ bat@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , which now must find their place in society and to establish a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a common history of peace . &quot;
up to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogotá .
&apos;@@ I would never thought that anyone would be for@@ given to me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a traveled to camp to convey the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done it before to counter@@ ing the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive any prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of people from all over the country .
it was a very event@@ ful moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; told the policy @-@ knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , describing this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare ) saw , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ granite lights , a deadly weapon in the village of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him nevertheless and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hope@@ ful letter .
never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , that is why I answered my tears over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him fully and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ acy .
perhaps he was tired too , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger pan@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would be given to me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there that wa@@ its with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion group .
the students had all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in the bor@@ ated .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice through the state interven@@ ed upon the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in that country .
for a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard before and had no electoral law , and to recognize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage , who can teach us a smile and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the Commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Kolum@@ bi@@ ans was proph@@ esi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament would have peace .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and to protest for their rights , and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC , now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore we call all def@@ ender of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology - do they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience , that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of spon@@ ge men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that is like a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the dor@@ m@@ LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not created only by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who had shared some of her experiences and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won several months ago that international head@@ lines were conquered , after reports have been published , the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who took sal@@ ary que@@ er men and took them in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she actually was a woman in reality .
when they grow up , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen was experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the end in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as an honorary assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day it was said to me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a wife that put in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents were carried out by the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I just arrived there was to generate a few shopping cart from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt a bit in my body , but I don &apos;t hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ us the family , you fail ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost awareness and finally after the end in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had received everything and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had f@@ aded two f@@ aded in my right lung .
OC Media : in what sick@@ wing , they were laid - in the men or women of women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , as my male name stands still , but the doctor stood and laid down on the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ tious name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he met with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
in February I got threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ club .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they created absurd demands : some said to me , I need to prove it by passing up without the streets ; others wanted to step up on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photoshop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have gra@@ zing size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for her .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a Monster to the World which is not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you need to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she had a stri@@ pe about the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with a black@@ out window @-@ plate and a Num@@ ber@@ n@@ shield with a 95 bar .
after the third time it happened was clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights @-@ friends check the numbers of numbers - it turned out that I was per@@ sec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give her name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived .
I bought it without having to register without having to go .
I cr@@ ashed my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I tasted the SIM card to my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you are in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel du st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room@@ mates .
just to prove to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality . however , this is a sp@@ u@@ issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditional cold elements I still tra@@ ge in me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as much as I wish , this emotional barrier can I do not overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself to look at how the person will look out of her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ sal ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who did eat a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan , there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he won a new wave .
most likely they will focus now on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are also recorded even more gay men in these secrets of intelligence ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there was not much too many .
if , then above all those , who have no rich relatives , or were dropped by their relatives to stand Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that you can present them later than terrorists .
say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base .
understand you ?
as if these people were not just van@@ ished , they were targeted to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a tra@@ verse , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just asked somebody who was arrested one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there have been nothing new about them since then .
they have simply taken them together .
and this so called Lord , that person himself was , when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why else would one not have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know if this per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already exist in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wor@@ e my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , just before 2003 I was already well known all over Grand , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was true , I never had problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; Civi@@ lization &quot; but ultimately has thrown back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were ground@@ ed ; I had colored eyelashes , carried the tube je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria has never called me just a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , there met .
we have never been ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ote does not have the hurt of another . &quot;
it often tells them to children when the sick of over cranes make it funny .
OC Media : so do they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the Plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality .
he did not speak about us by e , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change .
who used to be sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed you at one time with susp@@ ici@@ on .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I &apos;m not busy much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of Psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , toge@@ ther@@ ings , I beg@@ ged them to hospital and help them to get f@@ oo@@ f@@ uses .
I do not spend a pen@@ ny for them .
I discovered these people themselves when I ins@@ cribed their flight .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : enter a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is al@@ oud .
so Nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya who wish to white you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no co@@ ils with them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ins have which , the Russians are also what ; on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go into the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ tions for men who love men , and they believe that you can change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling , in order to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;ll be here as personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad for that reason - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian r@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the past few months there is a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August re@@ confirmed the dou@@ bt@@ ful situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he sh@@ ame@@ ted for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that arise the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video held the moments , after having risen himself , firm .
some people get rid of it quickly , the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources , according to those doctors were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority and campa@@ ign@@ ers warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ de Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - heard .
their stories are one thing in common : they were all family gather@@ ings that felt because of the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and un@@ able to feed their families and follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , where a large part of the population living in Iran , was troubled by the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was troubled by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to pun@@ ish its living .
a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi Mon@@ archy took over power and took in 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran pre @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of un@@ treated disorders , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime has denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , built by the waters of the Arab regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are direct .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by drying caused in the region and destroying the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian @-@ General for co @-@ operative , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told the present situation , a mix of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high increase &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ als among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ himi said that especially the unemployment has become more recently worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of im@@ balances in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the imagination process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ ac@@ az@@ i will have access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to cr@@ ush the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood beyond their homeland .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to become so an@@ gled , since even Arabic names can not be tolerated in the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the given circumstances that have to endure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights defen@@ ders will have to beat , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world awak@@ ens and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not reconc@@ iled with the femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought of scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally need to be all Femin@@ ist * .
for example , women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men .
that women still stand under strict monitoring if it is about what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass covering sooner or later in different areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and well known .
I am convinced , and I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q church or black women from the Dias@@ pora ; if I mention , on which kind we have been physically , spiritual and verbal mis@@ ses , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are to be silent .
but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - come together to find &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk that in addition to sexual violence an institution@@ alized violence is a institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women twice .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and of origin areas earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres , and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership , than white women .
on the one hand , I want to see that all the women , all men and all individuals , nor any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , which refuse to take into account the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner held in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized human being .
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs in order to expe@@ dite their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to put white women the importance of the intersection of skin colour and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give to women of different cultures and dis@@ car@@ ded themselves from the white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to get rid of me full of femin@@ ism to redeem me of the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ y@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author &apos;s car in the book Afri@@ cana : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing back ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves as we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are instantly invo@@ king instantly separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , please ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a woman due to my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment where my life is neither covered , nor ignored , nor denied .
p@@ ad@@ ra@@ ke against the pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution of To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental issues .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will again be published again .
repeatedly traveled Nab@@ il Mus@@ a in the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution to its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of cas@@ ks , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ keeper Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was recorded for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq with a documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and published .
the focus of her work lies on per@@ sec@@ uted , little be@@ aten sub@@ cultures and is distinguished by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed municipalities , their stories can tell in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult struggle against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their ref@@ us@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the cr@@ ashed and modified version of article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ grab@@ bing ) that reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
the majority of names were changed to protect the people concerned .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner , who had become non @-@ violent against violence .
since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to Mis@@ ation , the ac@@ informed display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is also nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the devil @-@ circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women had to report at all once , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases the women also depend on the men that they are mi@@ xes . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be the victims of violence be reported at all at all pro@@ secution authorities .
content simil@@ arity and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ abuse and a Legal System , which is nothing subject @-@ to @-@ 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation of windows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women really are mis@@ ed , &quot; says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for Gen@@ der@@ us at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ EA , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , but not even approaches to the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 the District Court of 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here , 86 % of the indicators came from women .
in the ads said 40 % of women that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics are not showing the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s mini@@ ster@@ in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes will actually be displayed . &quot; on every woman who will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse , come 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who will be re@@ funded for physical abuse , come to two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the@@ o@@ cide in Paraguay is not own crimes , the pro@@ secution authorities cannot be properly documented , how many women were mur@@ dered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists written at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases when women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies on the basis of violence by men .

invisible distr@@ acts and a legal system that is not under@@ takes
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name all of her former friends .
at the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then there was still . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years they carried out the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable :
I never thought I would once have been a victim of abuse .
if I &apos;ve read earlier this , I thought that only women happens to be sub@@ servi@@ ently because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name call , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least have at least a certain inno@@ c@@ ence .
Victoria San@@ tos that was not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has g@@ aged them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; I believe &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
your wealthy partner eventually managed to convince them that they were worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays at the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an un@@ logical legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resi@@ stor@@ s and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ge@@ der@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees great problems with regard to the laws of the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ an parliament , who was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Princess ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ denial ) are a part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ee to explain fem@@ inists into an independent criminal continu@@ ance and to pun@@ ish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the leg@@ est@@ al text was altered in a number of points in order to also win members of the law that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , who are currently banned in Paraguay and be pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison .
the original law was envisaged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures that have to wear the victims of violence currently , if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation , to raise the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient funds for this purpose :
in Paraguay Mis@@ abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
whoever swe@@ eps the face of these facts is guilty and contributes to the perpetr@@ ators of the perpetr@@ ators of the cul@@ min@@ ers .
we have to refund a long display until mis@@ sal is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . before , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled , the partners in cases called domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor , its victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from part of the law is considered a great retreat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the cr@@ ashed and processed version of article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ grab@@ bing ) that reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
the majority of names were changed to protect the people concerned .
independent media in O@@ man launched a year after the prohibition of a newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked due to a decision by the information of information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is locked on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Forbidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he p@@ auses a one @-@ year term .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but came later again .
O@@ man is ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us I@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had his father , S@@ aid I@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state dispute .
since then , he held , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Ober@@ ster Command , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of the sult@@ an is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , public freedoms , including press freedom , limiting and defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and activists , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country like corruption in government and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , her closure , and detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces of I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , decided to have published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; s hands of justice . in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , governments were accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to lift up a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties tie the hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , of the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adopted the Vice @-@ president You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had been editor @-@ in @-@ editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time , after the information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on je@@ al@@ ous routes , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first negotiation took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison and ord@@ ained the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among others because of the dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; submission of the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty to violation of a publication of a publication and guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three @-@ year sti@@ ckers and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was charged against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a monetary policy in the amount of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , having the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit was established in the amount of € 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released before the verdi@@ ct on 22 August 2016 .
the Court of Appe@@ al said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was freed on 10 April 2017 , after the completion of his six months sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j was still in prison , where he was sentenced to his year &apos;s sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to conclude the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court to permit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Israeli government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister sent a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed another statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus bringing the Minister again against the decision of appeal , the publishing of the newspaper again .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man was viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
other violations include the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the press freedom .
the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release up immediately and uncondi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists will be able to carry out their work ;
3 . protect press freedom in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights and without fear of susp@@ ending measures , including court @-@ breaking processes .
the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and the neighbouring countries to gather peace@@ fully and provide protection to them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the demand on @-@ site medical research there are two reasons : a lack of medicines and vaccines have a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ ite Warri@@ ors is director of the centr@@ ist at the Centre for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS @-@ epide@@ mic showed initial impact on the national health .
he left Sam@@ bia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he headed for himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the leading healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
in addition , I have just a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what do you think is the most important science topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always be recipients , instead of being movers .
the solutions we get are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it enough ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very differently funded .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because finance and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you have not previously had ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs amount of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus and how can we support the development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it very much .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed , things to do , and the complicated access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles available only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed manufacturers change global food production
this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton recorded a salad for the 1980s already since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 types , such as Out@@ red@@ ce , the first plant cultivated by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed .
almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only due to his own random order and the question of how many sal@@ at@@ eries he can get , bo@@ unds .
but at the beginning of 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he was not able to use them for breeding .
the patents g@@ athers not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or under@@ cutting leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants like grain or cart@@ oons . because of this trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alist and expert for food security are the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still drinking , he now needs for longer because his work is becoming more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock , in order to p@@ addle the p@@ add@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to make this right now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents on sal@@ ads go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand court , no one can breed any more a new species of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . so it goes on as good as possible and trying to breed those features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also attached itself to a movement that is ever increasing in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ce in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copyrighted software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the framework of the initiative , shortly Os@@ si , the US @-@ breeders are able to commit to that others may use the seed files that were bred from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder only allow others who want to buy seeds , to breed , and it is not immediately dispos@@ es - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant producers .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark views
for the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed &apos;s seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both for food security and for environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; clo@@ ak@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not occupied with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , the recent examples would like to purchase the interaction of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which is offered in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way it is cultivated in farm markets , should also know that the way that vegetables are bred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sou@@ l@@ ence without seed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing other seed sound freely . in this way its action is to be patented in contrast to the seeds and plant characteristics .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si suppor@@ ter argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the available gen@@ et@@ pool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus always restricted , non @-@ shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has been engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ o@@ irs are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders either not at all or difficult to use .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ built plants like wheat is still in a larger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Question of View
plants are bred so that they target@@ ing targeted features - of such , by which their tastes or colour improves up to such because they prosp@@ ers and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders have increasingly dimin@@ ished more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed circumstances are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ akers in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic variety .
it contradi@@ cts that the intellectual property uses other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method .
thus , such protection in@@ hibit innovation not , but promotes them by being made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent occurs , is certainly not innovations .
and if you have to wait for so long to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the fight would have already been lost .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their job easier .
that is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mor@@ ton reveals itself to the concept itself , plant characteristics , &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
they form the plants themselves and as a bre@@ eder we finally have no idea how the plants do it .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is raising a variety , is raising his own values into them .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , for their cultivation mass@@ aging qu@@ bi@@ cides , is bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly se@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets but smaller than B. Mon@@ san@@ to are patents ) , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they refuse the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is seeking sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant patented innovative would : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger as a company who has patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; says it . &quot; with a patent for 20 years before competition , it is very easy to do so . &quot; worldwide resonance
while the US seems to be a leader in &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept itself now spreads throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , describes an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; plant breeding program . to preserve the plant &apos;s traditional plant varieties , the centre cooperates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , and sell their own home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is currently working on an &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which eventually is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , present for the Os@@ si obligation not easy to become one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive committee of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office which allowed patents on conventional crops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not a law ; it is now at the governments of the Member States to bring this new line into this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting of seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declares that the organisation is currently preparing a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding systems , for the scheduled next year of the official start .
a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database to seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish a seed map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a federation consisting of relief organisations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . in this it represents that farmers have the opportunity to get in seed , exchange and improve seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food .
in the report the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is stressed - a connection from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has primarily been given to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their foods is there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

all winners received urine as memory and other prices such as souvenirs with the competition logo or vou@@ chers for on @-@ line shops .
the authors of the 11 photos with the highest y@@ ur@@ rec@@ tions as well as competitions , which were photographed most objects and were able to collect most points in the total score , were honoured with the prices .
further prizes were awarded by other organisations that joined the competition .
for example , the employees of the Holo@@ si@@ i@@ v@@ sky@@ i , who is located in the metropolitan region Kiev , the three best photos selected in said Park and have been submitted for the competition .
in addition , in the national competition there were also some special categories : &quot; Un@@ v@@ Discovery &quot; that documents the destruction of natural habitat , initi@@ ates by NGOs from the environmental sector , an overview of issues , on Wikipedia , best game life photos and best Ky@@ i@@ v @-@ Photo

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government proved the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on above .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Group - in spite of this attack and ruin of the Egyptian laws and the constitution by the authorities to pursue the law , to pursue the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even if it never was so difficult to pursue these goals , to overcome the block@@ age and do not follow it . we insist that our task continues to fulfil .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the public authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , as e.g. the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that of the Qatar network of Al J@@ aze@@ era due to the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web@@ sit@@ ters have fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights explor@@ ers Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he does not write to the accessible websites and media for Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog was directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the purpose of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Blo@@ gger , the provider with the blog post , is native , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photographer , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security guards in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as police exercise physical violence against two students .
his articles is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the block@@ age by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the ones who lock blogs are very old , but has given priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fatal U@@ tah @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It was successful to give me the feeling of a har@@ ass@@ ment ; a arrest , a attempted murder , pre @-@ unloading at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website , for whom I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items in order to handle the cens@@ or@@ ship .
now however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ zzle go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 web@@ pages . this generated technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE documented also the block@@ age of vendors , through the outlines of boarding facilities and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter on the Egyptian users access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will additionally be worse that the cens@@ ored decision behind closed doors will be made , whereby the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis to prevent them from judgment against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers report in whole Brazil with dark lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; every second day a police be@@ held in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stra@@ in@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disp@@ ens@@ ed with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and Lu@@ ch to Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the violence wave has been in Rio the highest standards for 10 years .
the Brazilian government organization Global Justice even called to attack the United Nations .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will be published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex drive , etc . everything , however , had happened by the civili@@ zed standard , and what happens only in Rio , is in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes to the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision is not the reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video there is a journalist of the newspaper , that according to details of the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial article the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , when it is distor@@ ted , even to cur@@ ate atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than they used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journ@@ alistic Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against it , describe the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a jus@@ tification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and independent negle@@ ct of public service .
memory : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . this is the most current data .
none of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .

these general policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela police and to stationary one unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP but after several reports on sli@@ ps and repression against the poor communities who actually should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under compl@@ ying .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the force in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention criteria for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
along with legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people after themselves .
because this calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war . for this , the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy &apos; , where a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; mist@@ aken balls . &quot;
war on or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police made the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence he made head@@ lines : an orch@@ ard died as a result of shots , who fired police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Syri@@ ans , mushrooms to plant
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following Civil War , many Syrian cities suffer brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a region where an attack against chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are derived from , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ acre of Assad &apos;s regime is committed .
since 2013 these have turned out of rebels controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to local residents or to rely on tunnels and control points of food and control points .
due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; .
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ lied and run the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms belong not to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , your dietary supplement makes it an attractive dietary source for many residents of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , told the French message agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , has been fighting for this project for three years , and expressed his relief , that it now gains more and more &quot; to a friend . &quot;
to raise money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge for plant@@ ing pil@@ es , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the condition of this article , they reached more than 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue till Monday , den 04 . September 2017 , continue to raise donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity with 80 % .
because of the fuel @-@ shortage , locally produced fuel are used from plastic , in order to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; Production &quot; from the regions called Pil@@ ots , &quot; before they were able to check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months they have to be found in the East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mush@@ room breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking down the shift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dissemination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by means of eating ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
to create new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied at their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the 2017
several hundreds of people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district court cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires which r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were in@@ ju@@ red due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state @-@ term .
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia , Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 re@@ bur@@ sts of fire , spread out in the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached some 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths by the fires and more than 200 wounded .
according to European forest@@ ry system that monitors the forest area by satellite , alone in 2017 , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is only in 4 districts of no fire .

many videos spread on the web and show pictures that allow better insights into what they have done :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the aim of the protest on Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked themselves why civil protection has not been able to com@@ fy the extent of the tragedy as much as possible
João Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing more evacu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are thir@@ st reports of open streets enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have had a similar tragedy in June as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
further , it will be questioned in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ abilities with high Bran@@ in@@ isi@@ ko .
a widespread proposal on the grav@@ ey@@ or , which had brought the government in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a barrier to the law that allowed the construction activity by case if the applicant was fed by means of self @-@ protection - that was an open h@@ ub@@ r , so that everything could be built , &quot; João Sor@@ val in the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o continues .
the environmental organization qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , itself , as in a devil @-@ circle , according to fires of this species continues to spread .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these problems arise that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens were looking for information or tried to contact persons &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a private initiative that gave the population with information : she used the own civil protection data with the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was founded in 2015 by the developer of João Pina &apos;s life to simplify the work of fire fighting and was so decisive in October that the server trac@@ ts the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who did not hold the fires , the website cl@@ oned more than half a million access .

the road from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had conquered the short@@ cut @-@ above @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ ana for the last time with his family during the dinner .
even when his mother did not say so at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning gray should break the boy .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ bs .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the army of Haz@@ ara , He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ ili had just been mur@@ dered from the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt uns@@ ure .
the Taliban known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara was ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after the escape , A@@ shar@@ ks found themselves in Pakistan .
he worked in a cohesion for a few years . work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and to@@ w sa@@ ws with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
at that time as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded of A@@ shar@@ per in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , where we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we attached N@@ ylon in front of the open windows that we did not catch at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ ks left his life without official documents in Iran and made themselves ready for travel to Europe .
with the dangerous crossing along the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum , A@@ shar@@ pen came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in the park and went to a church who divided twice a day to eat to help people .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high quality quot@@ as there is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are occurring , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil liberties Union for Europe is writing , the system &quot; suffers under a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seekers is accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special mounting centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ treated staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to an entrance centre when they officially asked a request for asylum - which can be hin@@ dered after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it is also A@@ shar@@ per .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible lifestyle help A@@ shar@@ ps to rid themselves soon out of these conditions .
after spending a number of work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ ps had its total savings in the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while , he opened a second hostel yet a second hostel and a whis@@ ker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ per Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians , are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan @-@ operated businesses , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to the Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen were largely made refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals are far enough about the Italian hospitality industry and the retail industry and aim to return to the country which he had to leave in@@ compar@@ es as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ per with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af gre@@ ets his plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul that can learn the packaging and consistency of packaging techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvesting impacts on the market and improve their financial situation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the issue of President and government institutions are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such action would be compens@@ ated with prison and monetary policy , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; condemned &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrated against the military coup , who fought the President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as much as 700 of the prot@@ esters , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in detention to a trial .
recently , his trial was postponed on 20 May because the prison conduc@@ ts according to human rights groups was bi@@ ased by the accused of bringing the def@@ endants of the prison in court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree with the burden of amongst others arms estates , illegal gathering , murder and experim@@ ented murder .
in another case , a pro@@ secution in G@@ iza was talking about two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting about pro @-@ Mor@@ si Rec@@ eption on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
