<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American films, I danced with American music, American writers and running his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily determined by an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud, who covered the Supreme court with judges, who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after method Man, "mir," as if this is the absolute truth, everything else is what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only ever strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very strange love story written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about xenophobia and racism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his engaging-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, people react to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number that one was ever achieved by the party nominate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigest person I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his electorate when I met Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism program that took people from all over the world, a deeply glorious person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, Trumps World vividly does not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had hit us with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Tahr who fought her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits her with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot of my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those with them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump continued his way to the nominee Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people for Trump have agreed because they either shared their racism and fanaticism or because they were ready to overlooked these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as the ramper.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people decide, told one of my friends, is exactly what led to us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most know are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who urge the cruel decision to raise a man who descends with contempt to those who look differently than he did.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Anm altitude): so much as" "" "hanging out of White against all other ethnicities." "" "word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as called the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people all over the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenya, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">Yet with the election Donald Trumps there is a huge part of the white America's promise, and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm again.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" broods the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latest a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a one-voting and voiced "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now trump land, told the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that is breaking down my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguas city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from nearby Indian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La Banda de Música (Musikbande) plays out in the municipality: one out of children and adults with existing symphony orchestras, offering their musical instruments an opportunity for overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banking force.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth always provided a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI.</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come and play with shiny eyes and play in the hubbule you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauk, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recycled material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-made instruments, which consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imided violin, viola, cello, double basses, guitars, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion, which were all manufactured from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire covers classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Satra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician's teacher, the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same point where parents worked in the rubbish. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed to be a favio something that he never had seen before: one of waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra which plays on instruments of recovered material and that The Recycling Orchestra is called.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation named "land-fill harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) offers the musical performance at:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around one billion tons of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These ostAfrican countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that dominates the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done within an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time it was known that this ship had already been operated in Lebanese waters of illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries have thus expressed itself accordingly and little inclined to welcome a Legislative of this kind on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised itself rapidly against the ship. they emailing him, one of their harbors, and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries, which you simply refuted everything" "", "Benedict Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also obliged to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plunders of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross criminal practices and protect resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally stop Fishing (Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have eight countries that are like minded and work together. you exchange information and stand each other on where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegating Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition unregulated: what is caught, it is hidden, because it is extremely difficult to absorb it. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the obvious disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the screw stamp, with the information between individual countries, thus the actions occur nowadays in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, individual countries can share with each other, for example, interact with existing licenses, news on suspected activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships even very attentive when they move around the open sea by means of satellite.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships which can fish in veritable areas. also, this suspicious driver to discover - about those that indicate that a ship attracted its fish fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies might show whether the participating ships have a fish license, where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can deny the adoption of such vessels in their ports. what does the ships not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers from penalties, as in the fall of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, conductive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultation company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already named platform was created to get estimated 20 million USD in wasted revenues that lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate to East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive Thunfish oils, present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. under these two illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices such as actions count as the sailing among false flag, counterfeited licensing papers, stating fantasies, the fish-protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically take advantage of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-completely organised control system" "", "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say" You daring my harbor not to walk. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'Komm to me'. 'and just this legal loophole is tempted FISH-i now to close.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i had participated in more than 30 investigations disguised ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has detected criminals which had lowered counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have several fraudulent identities used and it has fledged ships persecuted and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its collaboration with Interpol, the International Food Safety Authority, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organized by organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is intended to help FISH-i to exacerbate ships precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, helps to split the illegal ships that's like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships also turn on their automatic identification systems, with which they cannot be more of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations indeed influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, together with Google and the Marine Reserve Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown worldwide by means of each individual tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing," "" "he simply makes sense," "" "says it." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only a crime, but also terrify them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used earlier without license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries sales, fishing boats and more licenses purchased.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to split Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now copy," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study subject." "" "in West Africa annually, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "" "" safety is the aim of leaving even more such initiatives and structures in other regions, "" "" says Copeland. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia reported its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road with false flag. and not only the ship was on the road with no licence and became the tow network that is now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also penetrated into the belated waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" taking place of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing, "" "" says Bergh. "" "</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proving that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world ocean.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For crossing, one needs two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the initial text and active language skills to transmit it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native speaker should translate from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as their native language to complete translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for the reasoning, grounds or relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who themselves do not have foreign employees, have translated translations nevertheless to operate independently. then the Japanese employee, whose english knowledge is considered to be the best one, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worralled and puzzling phrases which arise by machine translation, show that this technique can still not replace a human translator. this is especially true for several languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weird English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often blamed t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the town of Kyoto uses a reliable source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="394">Other online broadcasted recordings of the protests in Caracas that were organized by oppositionists who resists the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and had transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author with Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was crapped, and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="405">Former postures of the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNA. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains bad.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS, the server is incorrect or denied the request at the call of such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ icapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transfer was stopped on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV camera cameraman Elvis Flores, who took live the protests in Caracas.</seg>

<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back to broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has to regulate the Internet connections: so the Venezuelans the access to multimedial reporting on current events in the country is always more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money outgives their minor son or her less year old daughter to another, rich family. in exchange receives the child food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>

<seg id="425">As a Criadazgo practice, it is widely used in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and increased.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things by name, for the feeling of gratitude that vaccinated the Criaditas, is guaranteed to be silent in general.</seg>

<seg id="462">She stood up against 5 pm every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example, they purified the refrigerator, putzed the living room, polished the furniture and disinfect the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose the user and users the registration. it is unclear how the Egyptian government should not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the bigger family of the Leopards, which goes through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of their habitat and since they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "the Persian leopard is the only surviving beasts in the Kurdish ecosystem 'and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is available.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards is actually to be seen in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore determines that they all have a shot of a great cat at the camera clothes, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo highlighted the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the "Dreifach catastrophe" from March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a real prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the consequential tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were pregnant, because the tsunami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima still lived a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report from the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows the progress made after six years to rebuild the local people.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of Japanese rebuilding and survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">The construction situation at Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (type of pastry, saigai kouei juutaku) were finished in the Prefecture Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could see Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is with 70 percent final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still strives to settle for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelabomers (Hizesu Yutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the Dreifach catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated dating from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was successful in this context. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated accommodations, who have been forested after disaster in homes, have been spotted in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwates the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">How the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by unhappiness until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the harbors in Iwate and Miyagi have now been put into operation at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery harbors were re-recorded.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have held large-scale farmers in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">"" "Miyagi could recover 93 per cent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic force, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares were destroyed by Fukushima, are in the "nuclear locking zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered again and recovered, but also here Fukushima still left behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand, as before the unhappiness. Fukushima still can only be 75 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated inhabitants. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo Zeitung writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the local residents have taken action to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed said that still enough is done enough in terms of catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her expenditure on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused their attention on the situation of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the enormous devastating earthquakes and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 Evacuhima from Fukushima were moved to almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were somewhat more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, which have been laid out for long term buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the stand of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still in the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas, who still have to return in Behelabella Hausen, older than 50 years old. they have to compete with massive constructions for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a matter of construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="629">After the end, the sugar cane industry was silent in the region, and the factory was lost, and after its installations, until only the smells from steel and concrete remained.</seg>

<seg id="643">The crushing of the sugar cane industry was an economic need: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They just left the factories that can produce sugar for the maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the rise in the world market.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they started to disassemble them, they also listened to the road to asphalted, this disadvantaged also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the area, and with already advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory was created in the area, whose production serves not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of N'we Jinan tour, the workshop manager mobile audio studios have to teach directly to schools and youth centers in order to accommodate young people songwriting, recording, audio- and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were guided by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in northern Quebec with ten Cree-Communities and then working with the Cree Hip Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus raising that young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance," or whatever is found in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsummonum First nation in British Columbia told, for example, the history of the Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," tied up to almost two dozen of the most indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video game to impart, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the young people are not able to dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagical stui Cree First nation have recorded, the refrain in Cree is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop Group who ran them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookside of N'we Jinan is available the strophe in writing, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like would not ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you take our cry!</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise up a day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad living</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go forward to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they chose the creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commenton, the reader and supporters of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also gives an article and adds the strophe in Silencript (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are displayed in the entrance of the entrance, are issued near the entrance, "Plastic Models of the dishes") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at this plastic menu and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the making of these plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the part of the Kappabashi district, there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes, who have documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic meals are usually so common that they don't even feel more striking at all. however, a new trend is turning into showy cell accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome released the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this unusual twist with the shoots.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new with plastic-operated cell bands, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kiteboarding, as in this case, refrigerated magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of shoots and magicians for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essays becomes increasingly receptive.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don was converted (a popular travel case with seafood) into a cell-stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple where your mobile phone will be holding:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">This is only the beginning of a growing rush into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon uses, a popular topping that will be served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter a few users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "are there someone who would say," "" "WOW, cool, now I can put my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic surgery can also take a less appetizing shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone-stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also motorballs (onigiri), earrings and handybelts made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other scurrile plastic meals can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # or on any type of view.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug trading" in Mexico, the Vermists and Drivers regularly dive only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this battle poses itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">In the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks upon the sorrow or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind every bone of bone in the hundreds of the heimer graves, the stories of innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal Político, called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir con El Narco" (German: "with drug-trafficking"), which aims to give these victims one voice and tell stories of people who work in the fight between criminal enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Pítico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drugs, and whole municipalities need to drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") telling exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="772">Where should we get the ones? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco," explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who pose the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragile and the state of state.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in Central Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, regardless of what form they are occurring:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and senationjournalism know I have been around for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm coming to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images, which can actually only be derived from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is halted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider it normal as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It continues on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is sco (German: drug dealers) will be when it is great. and it is also not normal that people listen songs about the "heroism" of the criminal, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is that they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid of that something happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to mere numbers in a statistic will be.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the insensitivity of people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the forced leave of 43 students be justified in a neighboring village that they have" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak out that they will be spared by such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months" spressors in the main city: "it describes how armed criminals had been looted by their business until after the end, not only the business was destroyed, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never goes, the trauma remains, the fear came back high when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap you or to kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot about how to crying. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one by force mayed generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions of how: who cares for the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other men of his age, whose parents worry about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphans and he tells you had to teach himself how to make a egg cooking, potatoes tows, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies which live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the vial of water, sugar and milk pulsing.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy which consists of violence and had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been over for two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father saw by armed men out of a squandering car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez saw the following:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, Juárez, the most vulnerable city in the world, according to the number of Morde according to indications of the Civil Council for Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the Prosecutor was encloned 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who are leaving the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. this project reminds us of those that we may not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Weljournalism 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim consists of the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug dealers, which has tormented the country in the past four decades in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it was deceptive to use tragedies, which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>

<seg id="823">But it poses questions to our desire for pictures on messages.</seg>

<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was taken as a testament to mass evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="852">A further step further brings personal comments such as this example misunderstandably the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to furnish arguments.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page claimed that the President of Myanmar is saying that the President of Myanmar was involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killings of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about Students who had been converted by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted message page Análisis Digital, has expressly declares that the picture does not belong to the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar dashing attack."</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events, the mutuousness in the name of Islam, have paid a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weed as proof for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were picked up in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting, compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was alleged to have been written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" on the Nigerian massacre, translated this discussion, like this here in Vietnamese and explained it to the false statement.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that undergo these Posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion wants to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth studying how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers are no longer able to believe these pictures any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are sixty people, the unintentional part of having the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowed it the real crest of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images was already debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that that withhold images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. at times, these images are even required by the victims himself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and audience have desensitizing and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which studied how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some with regards to violent representations in the news media there is fact that they are indispensable for current news reports.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture appears to be suggested that actually, but also resolved by the context or on totally abusive style.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, every investigation of false subsidies should also take into account as internationally as they can.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) attempts to provide language-inspired a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in any language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslated words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese dedade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Arbremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">However, all contradicted stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have already been collected in an online list for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist chose from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwotesque language of Vanuatu, like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Notice to your parents in recognition of how we have tried for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi," The convenience or laziness that makes you feel after a cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They resolutely other cultures, revealing other thought-tions and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish more of these "untranslated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of what is aware and unaware of the "other"; as it did my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women's March, because there is no president in which we have no president who bombed the chocolate countries, while he has already broken down "humans" goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytellers, from Flickr-users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the result of stories in their original language a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices has recently reported a different initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to children's children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, take the diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen often often related," these events will instead "hear" these events instead "to appreciate, to feel, to make."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format the storyteller tell their story first in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation makes it possible that the audience's access to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They give laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round takes the storyteller of Rassidatou Conate also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of Cretart.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fork from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having explained the importance of his navel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide crest, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were quite at me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organizers hope to expand it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reexamination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, who took up to 72 million US dollars, took part on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations at a mass demonstration; the march started at the puzzoriexican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Jugoan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called by grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Bürgeramt for the neurastical of debts) and the eccomic Church of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercessors of the renunciation of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos are calling for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their corrupt.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial examination and a mission committee, without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions of appropriate remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he did for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference held on digital culture, which is oriented in Berlin, is devoted to an event of # FreeBasle-campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a Wissenschaftlerin of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühner, Business leader in book sprints, a publishing house by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lasen extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Discovery (The cost of freedom: a collective night research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which has been published last year and is available here licence-free, contains a number of attempts to deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book will discuss how movements can be built for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artist, designer, developer, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartabil, the beloved and guessed Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra prison list, which he sat on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push to his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us can begin to think about their own fates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been operating since March 2012 in detention of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 bassel was transferred from the Adra-prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi, told that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "drawn command of the military attack from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it to be contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who submitted himself as an insider of the Assad government, and inform them of a alleged death part against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and state will remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">Pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basle played a crucial role in extending access to internet and knowledge for the surrounding public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment overwise the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bases cultural prototypes are predictive than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the intersection of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with hiesky traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time bassel could not yet know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would have put all this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This poignant into the digital archaeology and the preservation has created a time-capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically this project has not yet been completed yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life with it, of freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Basel brought me English into even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners, English to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel gave me the door to technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet upon me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also attached other prisoners, such as they use computers, at least theoretically, without making them one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waste (Wait), a craven which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 till 2015, when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Basel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She discouraged the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book by Nora with the title "It happens."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It is happening in each visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I will be reconciled in the world of your enchanting eyes</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the spider in the moment we embrace,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That any of the hazards is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, fetters and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the throng of prison</seg>

<seg id="1236">If your eyes may say good</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will let another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness.</seg>
<seg id="1239">To return all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to smile about your absence and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuaded myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Basle, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year is passing, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protest 2011 the regime Bashar al-Assads have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrisky Network for Human Rights) more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared in non-violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: because of corruption deputy director after release there again on forecasted post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted to a corrupt regime in which a government member returned after half of his sentence. he returned to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a form of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008 was established.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good management and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on 19 April then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecutor of the Republic, which claims the application, there would be no obstruction reason for Cambaza to re-refer to his old posts as the company had no disciplinarproceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't have the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Center for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, sentenced in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Putting an envelope in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and even becomes a step toward the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have enforced on the indiscipline of disciplinarity.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently appears and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosque social media, rejects this behavior as well and considers the case as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and where half of them did eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could consult and rest his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to reintegrate into the company which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Vira, young Mosambians and Student der Political Science in Brazil says, the director besses no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded with someone in such a way that the state has already destroyed so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morality and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead he serves only himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a handler to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself is tired of this man who was forced and eventually condemned to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a thief belongs to prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to Samora Machel in prison, not only for ever as the first independent president to be remembered, but also as a sharp, intersecting and - side by saying - prophetic presenters.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was when he energised to be "a ambitious person for all, even the fatherland for its ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious person will change, my experience shows that he is not so. he does not alter the tactics, but he turns not to its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">A ambitious person is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also rejectionable:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat for 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today he sets up the company, in which he funds uncontented, again under agreement. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - out of these funds (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12 May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar Pae" means Kichererbse or Spaltercse.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their postings from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to link to people in East India, or generally speaking as adjective" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or on any part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma during the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely descending connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslim who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight with hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself does not pop up with a hate language.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about the purpose of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover there are several Burmese words with some different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese also contains' Kalar htaing 'written what the same letters contains, as well as other words like' Kalar Pae '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookier Aung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual nature whether they could bet, just as he could soothe his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + "Healing" (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that she must decrease hate language radicalary nationalists but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it spread all posts to disseminate racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">There filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatiatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and control it by checking the words by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (altercages).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that this three-dimensional nationalists disseminate the frank-language, a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everybody, the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often will begin a kiss and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Myath described as Facebook began to extinguish his posts as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banished:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the Word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was sorry, post and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post office "The Facebook community standards did not ignore."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to portray their opinions against the hate speech radicalary nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author told his opinions about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are poor.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before starting the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "these words to censoring will only bring more hate within the various communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Furthermore it seems as if they started it without local context or technical support and have forbidden as words like "" "" chair "" "" or "" "" inheritance curry "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the suspenned Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only some more respect for the 15 million health benefit, they would have a great turnover, would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now on Facebook funny and write about the word 'Kalar' not within the context of a hate language to see if their postings are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, which contained no hate language, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese Text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch hereditary y and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out whether Facebook is the post office, which contains the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"post" If you are a doctor, do you cure people? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to broaden their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks, acts in the communities in Myanmar, in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have been forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring the ballot of hate speech to his Burmese sides under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censored the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to concentrate rather on context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guide for example had no concerns about the critics of the children before they should say, damn away for their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition assorted for tensions in this really complicated matter, and some point out there came doubts as to whether the opposition would disagree with the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against the strous - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a Status update, which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children of childhood was adopted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one was decided against it.</seg>

<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users was enthusiastic because the laws on the hehe was finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member of Lovell Francis, who held a Minister of Education in the Education Ministry, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has all too much time and unnecessary talk, needed to wear the core of the matter, but know what? the children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now and that is almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of the opinion was, it was definitely long enough to put the practice was Lara Quentral-Thomas overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, Excellent news!</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia-page was displayed on January 18, 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Law in the USA, internationally represented.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey unlocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information and to share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporter and fans of TV series are blowing against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although a lot of technology-versed Internet users are used to use orbit tools for blocking web pages (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-biggest VPN presences of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unobtainable from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; society at Harvard University has been held since 2007, after the internet law has been adopted (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked there are several mirrorsites (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), acting as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia-pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so calculators computer connections), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not able but can be retrievable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything in terms of snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content on decentralised and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is just about screenshots and no Liveor dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknock.org, a mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as Wikimirrors, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsites when in the respective country is blocked out.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigskar - Global Voices member as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigici's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to a different URL that is not the original one. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server manages the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurry with bad positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry out a camera itself and try to understand the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring an international arena to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland is right next to Chitwan National Park, offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos, steer the attention on Nepals.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as he helps his first-class situation in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photography!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I sat just at home, when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father to be a Leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the Leopard was, and I immediately began to crush images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to co-operation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as a nature and wants to deepen the understanding of the fact that wild animals are not as horrible as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already tiger already from face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the beacon appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and He starred me through the sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to make at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days lasted until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it is possible to avoid women with the greatest care, the name of their husbands or even older men within the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state OCina by a sleigh, and chased by their family and the village community after having mentioned a marked relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also do not call their wives, is also common among men. however, they have far less admittances to fear, if at all, they should not come from this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walser in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club with and were thus quickly became the main-orientated topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, there are in 13 Indian states it is a part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working with the help of its video camera for seven years with the help of practices, like children's heir, to the expediment of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They report how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini was in their discussion, was of women, who do not name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">If they do not speak out loud the name of their husbands, it is a breadmaking, whom they have all impaired and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered a rear, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition has been so deeply rooted, that we never thought about this discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband, until now, at home, try at home as it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband are not long until the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Pracash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name it from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some felt it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the Round Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection attempts to put the discussion with a exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked us all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the Breeding of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never allowed the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only went away during the whole exercise; a different decided to allow the whole past frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalintoxication, having broken with an age-old bread, the women decided that they were actually trying to call home their husbands with the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-mother she became starred, she got fear and told that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which illustrates the Eighatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred spot if he was too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely abandoned, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip on any discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to worry who could hear what could hear" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; she danced and spoke about things that they had never thought beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have seen some things, for example as our identities have been linked to our husbands, and never talked as honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salary cta, a wide shirt over a pants; they have not dared up.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion of the advantages of one's own choice, morality, connected with the saris and much more, muggelded Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Obershirts) into a discussion, so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion club has already changed a little, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done so far only little steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and are not members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women bear now at any time of Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggle for more freedom of movement or their own closeness - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">One of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman is going home and reported to other people about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that probably was made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017, in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his attorney ended at the end of June, that he had been sent to hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years of prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after joining the charter of the Charter 08, a manifesto that the democratic reforms in China was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China has outlined the case as a" "" "internal matter" "" "and a spokesperson telling it to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet in Liu Xia, release or give him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unized nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Pod Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">"" "" "" "however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to make Liu abroad a treatment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's prime minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer any questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into shock after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was granted to Liu, although the Norwegian Government rushed to do that ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon after China, since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news had spread that Liu was seriously damaged, the Nobel Committee did his hope for a unconditional release to express and lud Liu, to pick its price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to its adhesion, he was not able to counteract its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The peak diplomats of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius for the release of Lius on the 30th of June:</seg>

<seg id="1653">A speaker at the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the Embassy on the Chinese authorities release, not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia of her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The invitation of the U.S. message attracted an angry response from China, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to interfere and to make unanswered comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as free movement and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim loud Chinese and judicial system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Rley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to relinquish the Chinese government to relieve Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns, whether the vortex could adowed the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China called for providing adequate medical care to provide us with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Ananians told AFP previously that Lius woman, Liu Xia that could visit him every day but the police always overlooked the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Liu, with someone outside, including his attorneys to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada invites China to protect its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, to protect and release the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he, irrespective of where, requires. furthermore, his wife and his family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news-sender France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that you will find no further information whether France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the Hungarian affairs in Taiwan asked China on 27 June to release a greater tolerance against those who call for peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature of Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic progression Party called China also to allow to allow local liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leaders in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself in a statement on June 28 at Liu and gave us that many asked him to pray for lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives that he took and for which he was strictly punished, to a harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and the rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International Decist Association of the State of New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is it, whereby most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we may be different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "rotate the logic," "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land, you hear that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so volcanic, it had the semblance of an escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given its, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers to give democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it adapts better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam, there were answers to his American guests concerning our press, our Judicatives, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He answered appropriate questions with no-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to make his opinion a clear, as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, thus to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take care of this point, provided that he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">When Anon published his commentary on the blog, he pointed out to the critiques in order to read the whole co-ordinance of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "said the elections in Singapore will be so unequal even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">Coming to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he is obviously not meant to be in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a adolescent generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Minister of Minister of Singapore said, very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that I expected - if I do agree, or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure whether he believes it is true and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sets the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "repared a mistake" or was it a Freudian account?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go the sovereign rights to the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and town.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the avows do their military service, do they defend their city but not their land?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom must our Prime Minister pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink recruitment certificate?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the magazine Journey of a Decade to the Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many immigrants...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "defence of the country above all" "" "etc." "" "but this is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers will be revealed here as part of a continuing series, with the rumors to be revealed about certain parts of the world and have shown a different facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question that is posed to me in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," said I then. "I am from Canada." since 1994 I live back and back in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutors by providing personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my visas then usually follows the default answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many Canadians boil perhaps inwardly before anger, when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that differs us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag well visible at their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans in contrast....</seg>
<seg id="1750">This was how I started 20 years ago to travel through the world - prior to Donald Trump, before the march in Iraq and before 11th September.</seg>

<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "first, called" "" "nice" "", "is basically to be sparse - just like the good-natured, gentle, but portable figure Ned Flanders from" "" "Simpson" "" "(which has an own Canadian double-tower)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing where you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you want to remain unnoticed in the background away from the things that pass around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, a prime minister of Canadians is.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not often talking about the fence, with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Thankfully for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau then joined the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada pretty much sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59- year old, a small woman with a corals pink Brillery and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called the Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on a journey through.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with high-grade, abusive walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, told woman Ramírez, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">You would not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines which they can not pay, they massaged them with a balm that gained from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghstache) by Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1921">It has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, she hopes to arrive to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to stop normally a first stop in South America and then moving towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other agents of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel together the circuit and that, the Africans are already talking to Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his guide, Michelet has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a builder on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer team.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sold SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket for Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again" "", "he smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs Ramírez tells that their guests often send their messages to text messages when they have gone to kiss them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explained that her Christian faith may be the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but her guests have contributed to her to prepare her chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs Ramírez is perhaps very well-known, but it is not the only flaw for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is polishing and has established that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are too expensive too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered to them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment are 25 people there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "", "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After being lived for three years, he was moved out of the United States after a raid on his work place.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he was braked in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press out from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula it was asked for an accommodation and a unknown, an all-known, has offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travelers consult calm their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus is arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs Ramírez seems happy about her house is full, but she also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother snake them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair blers that took her a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang citizens are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of the town of Urumqi on 10 July, in which it indicates the District government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the Communication, it is said that the app will" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But kònested the authorities use the App for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private-chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine and trace the information and distribution paths of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojers and Phishing pages to make users attentive to how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in harmony with other measures aimed at controlling the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital airship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gristerer for those who live in remote, printed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet mixes.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This based on Twitter-based media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (anonymously), the aging messages published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint, at the police officers the residents dropped as a result, then checked whether they were installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected on a checkpoint using a device without this software, you could be detained by up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have compelled the people to use devices that are meant for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back again in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (both travaguars), also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the identifier requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computer and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the city party, to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental, administrations, and with the party, including universities and research institutions, are required to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office when running her computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation laying down to all residents and entrepreneurs until the 1st of August their "personal ID cards, mobiles, external drives, portable disks, notebooks and media memory cards to register in local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy. however, this action is violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives it penalties for a number of other possible delay, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside; sometimes he lates on his canvas, sometimes to his own computer, to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But on what one can rely, is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belongs to them since 1967; the year in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine that they lived as felahyea (e.g. Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old tried and proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but he also asks the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only in his hometown Amman Relevance but also in cities that are rich from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind through limits, and he can feel according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not have access to the US American foreign policy a particular aversion.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war areas, something to do with his identity as a Palestinian fleeting of the second generation, "even though he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own life circumstances so" "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that, because I am a man," "" "while he is poured out in water of the nest-café in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Israeli law also assays that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a mug of coffee on a sensory hot junk is little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the battles of lukewarm coffee and the shadden of the kent-cigarette in the nose is first and foremost of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially if one throws a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Thus, it is simply ignorant of doing basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to land in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Department of Ministers of Jordan has announced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"" "" "" "some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Committees of Action - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman, Hamed Mirao, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and be the main reason for the concert band." ""</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members of the former press and former press-press in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just had been canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents an ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila said the jordani people as" progressive "" "" progressive supporters of human rights "" "," which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply silky rhetoric but actually reflecting itself more clearly and crystallized reality in Jordan, which appears in Hdaib's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In the year 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to be lyre by formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have precepy sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the Skeleton of a apparently lower unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of innumerable women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Honmordes' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016, however, that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to seek the victims murdering murders or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breaking action from 1954, women, who are suspended at risk in a familiar violence, "at indefinitely time in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from issues that long as tabu in his country as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib forested that his work is political, however it admits that he is his music, which is full of explicit reference to sexuality, freedom and expression, but not by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became a policy-like, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the assault." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib," and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one, in his words, "that can get what one wants" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians talks and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still highly censored until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan online programme Roya in order to later remember that his comments from the context was torn down, turning and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but has only been given a edited version," "" "says he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib openly for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib will ask: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century was able to write about homosexuality, why are Jordanian war not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Yet recently, in January 2017, the jordani news recorded several former government officials and members of the teacher, with the reason they had expressed themselves on comments in social media, expressed deep in the country rooted in deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this the concert Hdaibs is therefore only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring a structural change in the next generation of the plain of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks long, careful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordani society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreamed not only of being his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is characterized by music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, transitions and artificially-run democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time is, Hdaib will continue to have passed and therefore also make resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant war puffs are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspect that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas Tohocus. a further theory implies that the harvest, the drums and the tango over more than a thousand years came across to the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to catch a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this history, because they help the Peruvian youth to keep away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressing.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus is the most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high criminality where street noise and illegal drug stores are every day.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to becoming more normalized in the experienced hands of hairstyles, which can form these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts will compete against each other, to show who you can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos to current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to learn their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of poor advice in hair-style, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities that dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special education workshops prior to March in March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Columbia: love of the guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the news message to guerrilla warfare, which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love connection to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel spreading, affectionate with affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went to the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Foundation and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), which young people undersigned letters, guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was a venue of a historic event, and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerridescent FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which marks the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the sign of the peace treaty as so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Kolumbans, there is still a long way until you can talk of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, which had lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and round about the clock their weapons will have to integrate themselves back into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, which in turn has accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of suffering from guerrilla warfare, it must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian people were convinced that the young columbian has to come together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did as well: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love-messages to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla warfare - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá. Leonardo and Cristian was able to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, write thousands of love to write, but those who need them need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told us to share his love with people this year, which was most urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC, which now must find their place in society and to establish a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to date, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I would never thought that anyone would be forgiven to me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota traveled to camp to convey the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done it before to countering the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive any precepts, but letters of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very eventful moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," told the policy-knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, describing this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-granite lights, a deadly weapon in the village of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said to him nevertheless and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "I answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, that is why I answered my tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him fully and set me next to the pomegacy.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired too, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the hunger pantod. "I never thought someone would be given to me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there that waits with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had all grown up as a war and the FARC already acted in the borated.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice through the state intervened upon the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility to develop into a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in that country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard before and had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people that I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful emotions that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage, who can teach us a smile and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the Commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbians was prophesied that after the disarmament would have peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and to protest for their rights, and that is also completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC, now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore we call all defender of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology - do they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience, that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the road.</seg>

<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give her name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without having to register without having to go.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I crashed my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>

<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who did eat a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he won a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus now on family and relatives.</seg>

<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there was not much too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those, who have no rich relatives, or were dropped by their relatives to stand Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that you can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be converted, they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand you?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not just vanished, they were targeted to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a traverse, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just asked somebody who was arrested one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new about them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them together.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so called Lord, that person himself was, when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as a bandits, but there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would one not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already exist in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, just before 2003 I was already well known all over Grand, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was true, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to bring us to the "Civilization" but ultimately has thrown back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were grounded; I had colored eyelashes, carried the tube jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia has never called me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spote does not have the hurt of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often tells them to children when the sick of over cranes make it funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so do they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow joined the Plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us by e, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who used to be smiled and laughed you at one time with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic is constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I'm not busy much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of Psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, togetherings, I begged them to hospital and help them to get foofuses.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not spend a penny for them.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I inscribed their flight.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: enter a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is aloud.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So Nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnya who wish to white you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have which, the cabardins have which, the Russians are also what; on the whole planet there are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go into the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transitions for men who love men, and they believe that you can change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling, in order to be exact, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'll be here as personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad for that reason - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, react many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought of scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminist and why we generally need to be all Feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money in spite of the same formation as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict monitoring if it is about what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"" "" "" "or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass covering sooner or later in different areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs." ""</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced, and I am double and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I speak on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women in the LGBTQ church or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention, on which kind we have been physically, spiritual and verbal misses, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists are to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all agree that women - all women - come together to find "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk that in addition to sexual violence an institutionalized violence is a institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women twice.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and of origin areas earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background of the school are referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres, and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership, than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to see that all the women, all men and all individuals, nor any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join me as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, which refuse to take into account the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>

<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs in order to expedite their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to put white women the importance of the intersection of skin colour and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement no matter how many black women are trying to honor them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">"" "although the intersectional feminism was founded to give to women of different cultures and discarded themselves from the white feminism, still the word" "" "feminism" "" "is in his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of me full of feminism to redeem me of the movement of Womanism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so stubbornly that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clya Hudson-Weems, the author's car in the book Africana: reclaiming back (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves as we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are instantly invoking instantly separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, please ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution to its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country are concerned that the decades of war, the construction of casks, the pollution and the uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2481">The majority of names were changed to protect the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their partner, who had become non-violent against violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship was a little time passed and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena showed due to Misation, the acinformed display of Ada Báez is also nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the devil-circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women had to report at all once, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases the women also depend on the men that they are mixes. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be the victims of violence be reported at all at all prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content similarity and Statistical 2 Invisible Misabuse and a Legal System, which is nothing subject-to-3 Paraguay laws: good approach, defective implementation of windows and statistics</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but for two years they carried out the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name call, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two years relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the demand on-site medical research there are two reasons: a lack of medicines and vaccines have a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in building their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjite Warriors is director of the centrist at the Centre for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS-epidemic showed initial impact on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Sambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he headed for himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the leading healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrior discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrior speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the most important science topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always be recipients, instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it enough?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">Rw: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very differently funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because finance and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you have not previously had?</seg>
<seg id="2614">Rw: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs amount of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">Rw: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">Rw: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it very much.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often, it is the limited speed, things to do, and the complicated access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles available only against payment (the so called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton recorded a salad for the 1980s already since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 types, such as Outredce, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years, Morton's work was only due to his own random order and the question of how many salateries he can get, bounds.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of 2000s, he remarked that more salads were patented and that he was not able to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents gathers not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or undercutting leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants like grain or cartoons. because of this trends, plant breeders, environmentalist and expert for food security are the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton is still drinking, he now needs for longer because his work is becoming more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, as would lie in a river a rock, in order to paddle the paddles." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to make this right now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," "" "I think these patents on salads go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand court, no one can breed any more a new species of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. so it goes on as good as possible and trying to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also attached itself to a movement that is ever increasing in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the framework of the initiative, shortly Ossi, the US-breeders are able to commit to that others may use the seed files that were bred from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell. "open source" breeder only allow others who want to buy seeds, to breed, and it is not immediately disposes - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant producers.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed's seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "cloakenburg stressed that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not occupied with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, the recent examples would like to purchase the interaction of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which is offered in August or September 2016, should also know that the way it is cultivated in farm markets, should also know that the way that vegetables are bred.</seg>

<seg id="2657">Ossi supporter argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardised because the available genetpool due to the always numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus always restricted, non-shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has been engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartoirs are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders either not at all or difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-built plants like wheat is still in a larger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of View</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they targeting targeted features - of such, by which their tastes or colour improves up to such because they prospers and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders have increasingly diminished more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever since the changed circumstances are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speakers in Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos activities. with a total of four banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts that the intellectual property uses other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations." "" "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection inhibit innovation not, but promotes them by being made available to the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent occurs, is certainly not innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the fight would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to stay: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we can not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton reveals itself to the concept itself, plant characteristics, "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">They form the plants themselves and as a breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is raising a variety, is raising his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultures, for their cultivation massaging qubicides, is bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly seful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets but smaller than B. Monsanto are patents), they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they refuse the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in "open source" breeding, but the concept itself now spreads throughout the world.</seg>

<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed, and sell their own home.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government proved the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Group - in spite of this attack and ruin of the Egyptian laws and the constitution by the authorities to pursue the law, to pursue the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even if it never was so difficult to pursue these goals, to overcome the blockage and do not follow it. we insist that our task continues to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the public authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, as e.g. the independent news page MADA Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and that of the Qatar network of Al Jazeera due to the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of websitters have fallen victim. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI there is also no access to Egypt's blog on the blog of columnists and Human Rights explorers Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he does not write to the accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "now the blog was directed to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the purpose of an attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with the blog post, is native, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photographer, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security guards in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles is mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the blockage by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The ones who lock blogs are very old, but has given priority in the era of Abdelfatal Utah-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was successful to give me the feeling of a harassment; a arrest, a attempted murder, pre-unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website, for whom I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items in order to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muzzle go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 August 133 webpages. this generated technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE documented also the blockage of vendors, through the outlines of boarding facilities and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blockage of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and to filter on the Egyptian users access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will additionally be worse that the censored decision behind closed doors will be made, whereby the Egyptian population does not have any legal basis to prevent them from judgment against these actions." ""</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we do not close our eyes to the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision is not the reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video there is a journalist of the newspaper, that according to details of the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, when it is distorted, even to curate atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover.</seg>

<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" more than they used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalistic Cecília Oliveira, against it, describe the violence as "war." this is their opinion a justification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and independent neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we attached Nylon in front of the open windows that we did not catch at night. "</seg>
