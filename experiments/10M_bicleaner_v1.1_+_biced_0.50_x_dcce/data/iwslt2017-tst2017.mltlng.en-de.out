this is James R@@ isen .
you probably know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times .
long before one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen , wrote a book in which it was spectacular published that the NSA illeg@@ ally owned by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should make a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence surgery , in which the CIA was literally dra@@ ined by Iran for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 10 years the government was established against R@@ isen and asked him to call its alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to judge and journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they do so .
thus , when the government used the iron ore , he did something that many coura@@ geous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused to himself and told that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen thus lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , even though they were years of age , that it would be essential in its case , the demands of the government were dropped on rise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can become more and less hidden .
instead of fail@@ ing and att@@ aching to statements , this could also do their digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his telephone numbers were secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens ev@@ alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judiciary has more condem@@ ns than all the US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too far from their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of that whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we put the press work in the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty , because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ y all out .
but just as technology is allowed by the government to get the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and in this way , they can take the right from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the night , in the witness .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet illustri@@ ous , which was developed by us from Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I &apos;m working , further developed .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news @-@ site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information to any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the relevant message agency .
so the government is unable to provide any information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unfortunately , governments around the world develop constantly new sp@@ ying technologies that are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology reasons such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to express mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers ; or the next environmental workers , the alarm for contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t strikes . or a pilgri@@ m insi@@ der which war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that emp@@ ires and mo@@ tions &#93; &#91; we be@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ itness on a declaration . &#93; this week we were conducted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca in Panama . &#93; &#91; ... &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , there are reports that an Al@@ lies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s har@@ ves@@ ant firms in tax hav@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s president Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next un@@ covered documents .
this sounds like the ph@@ lot of a Lek@@ i @-@ agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems quietly away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we approach it ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness are phenomen@@ al .
all over the world debate media and leading politicians , how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some of them to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people all this world really confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I still imagine it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ ka man@@ ger .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers .
it can be very difficult for pro@@ secution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there were no prominent Americans available in this revelations , that sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ aic Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company as to get a libr@@ arian .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it does not allow sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip especially in@@ compar@@ ably investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global W@@ itness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring even money to the US to buy a home , a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that all until a lawyer made our inquiries made proposals , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ occupied . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anyone has been handed over money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer that spreads to our un@@ covered inquiries .
it is not about a single top trio , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to overcome this , we need to change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very much trouble as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could have changed , as if it &apos;s always the rich and powerful .
but as @-@ born optimization , I really see that a lot has started to change .
over the past few years we have witnessed more transparency in what the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU captured the central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a legislative act in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress , which we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Re@@ velations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global W@@ itness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind their home companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the business that get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and to stand up by laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end those kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally end .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ ow@@ es .
one day after I completed my design study , I made a rear @-@ back .
a type in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole land . after that he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you put it today ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
and I thought : Oh , Mann !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really plans . I don &apos;t want to end up in the luggage room of a Maz@@ ow@@ land .
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there for me ?
a wild ran@@ s@@ sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on ti@@ p@@ toes at the door , and my sleeping room door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me depends on in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood are sold as stran@@ gers , actually friends who are just waiting to be discovered ?
to host people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate is stepping out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ inhabitants Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I over@@ laid how we could earn anything about it . our apartment is designed for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WiFi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three Happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood flooring .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different because we made it for our guests .
we travelled with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door was in the castle , rigid Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things arrived in roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
thus we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one excl@@ u@@ des if you come by .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but indeed they do not .
nobody who is still very at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business , stran@@ gers allows , in homes of other people to sleep .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you anim@@ ate on the things that you can do well . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is overall experience .
we learned how to des@@ ig@@ ed objects , but now we wanted to get up with the immense confidence , among people who had never met before .
can design contribute something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we stri@@ pped .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs high when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to lock that you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ lock@@ able cell phone to your left seat .
this silent book of panic , which you can now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time the door .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the hidden cell of a stran@@ ger in my hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only time so , who has actually Al Gor@@ do &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you announce the Office of the President for the Office of the President ?
you can withdraw the phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had only once presented with his name : if he would have told how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 beats that all say : &quot; he can really keep very well @-@ sper@@ ed phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system rein@@ forces the confidence crucial .
in the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to release negative effects .
ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assess@@ ments before we placed it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and residence .
a bit surprisingly we trust the people the most , who are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre @-@ bi@@ ases .
it becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through assess@@ ments .
if one has less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , it changes everything .
a good reputation of similarities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
furthermore , we drove to trust that trust is dependent on how much you get reasonably priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , like for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get rather not a reply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell a lot , as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing a vacation with my family . &quot;
how can we create design with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards foreigners .
with what we had not reck@@ oned it was the great amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can realize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the in@@ def@@ ati@@ g@@ able work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were un@@ allowed parties celebrated or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all the phone calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stood at the front front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it does hurt , if I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , the 123 million closed overnight stays only a fraction of one problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , there may be miracle arise .
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host gave him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to stay for res@@ idency activities due to current activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true prot@@ ag@@ onists who save a life even though they are not at all right .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this is of course not running any stay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but these relationships behind the pure money trans@@ cription are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money trans@@ its ?
it is here about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing does not do justice to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships .
people lay up a part of themselves and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is with fast food to compare . it is efficient and reliable , but not less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be if at any place you visited a group there would wait to show a group there , to show a thoroughly and one in a pub pent@@ our neighborhoods , of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from ground to living ?
how would that look ?
what if cities would have taken the idea of the common part ?
I imagine the cities which enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parks that belonged to the government
were now offered by inhabitants . students who were looking for a place ,
were taught to people whose children were moved . there were cub@@ ator programs to be started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in Share Economy . through our platform alone , night , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted in numerous foreigners or hosts .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was attached to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was also previously .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep ro@@ ast@@ ed prejudi@@ ces .
I find the amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time about it if a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence I ask myself , for what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a believer ? an Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist attack ?
or just simply a delay on the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not give you the fault for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know any Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their log@@ gers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it is great , you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee house -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ te@@ te@@ an Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sing , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I chose to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adjust myself to a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty .
I have not only accepted the belief of my parents only pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , was in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and credible .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened itself with every reading of the grain .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I call myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone you perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands it , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later married , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then this terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had gotten to an end , looking into the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ill from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should one do something ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I joined the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only my country , but in the N@@ u turned me the acts of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same day we had to go through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new town and start studying .
I remember how I drove to -- as we scre@@ wed -- so deep it went into my seat and I feared the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new town , where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silk carefully &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; bo@@ dying in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sam@@ mm@@ ers not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or people that held for Muslims , while fighting it .
there were really Bran@@ ches on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have sm@@ elled the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain yourself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
those are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the human body .
it only poses the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under review .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the human body , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closure of mos@@ ques or be safer ?
there may be a few parking places , but not the terror stop .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith @-@ toler@@ ant , and show greater participation .
and as I was a leader of the police in the Washington area of Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
you will be radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radi@@ cal@@ isation process , one determined that it begins online . as First , the person is cut off from their church , even from her family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who desp@@ ises their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ likes by faith .
when we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group as the IS reveals its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into their imagination , when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claiming their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , she is not driving them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things in the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they perf@@ ected to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
being inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was an primary goal for instru@@ cting by extremi@@ sts who spoke their solution .
this Ima@@ m introduces the connection with God and its church .
instead of compl@@ ying with her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she did before joining the IS .
it was an insight , like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear each day affects our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , pass at least three things .
we tend to accept an authorized governmental system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : if you pres@@ et test people news in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood rises to Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manifest@@ ing the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early War@@ n@@ mark .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear swe@@ ar us all .
in the as@@ signing of collec@@ ti@@ c@@ ence it is not only about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental centre , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ est man who knew she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did this book have become such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook site .
he took eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be am@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or remain safe at home ?
we anim@@ ate it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about the America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided to get the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove to the mosque , with high pressure towards the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely re@@ filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack , but to join us .
in this moment I have been collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure of that ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have made a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who may possibly claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with deep walking are , in a class@@ y mind@@ factory , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not f@@ ool you . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family they want work and they want to live in peace .
so , in no way I am an exception .
if people seem to rule as an exception , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is short before , to become a billion man@@ ger .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug teeth . it is made possible in research institutes around the world .
before air @-@ net access into our social awareness penet@@ rated a autonomous fleet of aviation machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting cars to a high speed and acceleration in narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly load@@ able structures .
they have learned to wear bur@@ dens to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential within the autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a flavors of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance @-@ wards efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of H@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il like wind ar@@ cs .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance by practicing can be improved .
okay .
during our research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that prec@@ ede to the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the smaller number of mo@@ ve@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts , which work together to hurt you .
decades ago could fly away @-@ controlled air @-@ controlled air equipment , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a hal@@ ogen .
recently , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est control device . it has been invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hinges and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no other actu@@ ators or controversy , but a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much , so that it can fly stable and can move over to space .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I must throw it right properly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it right if all of you see , is low , so I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon is an exercise in gen@@ lon@@ eliness , this machine is here , the lum@@ ber with its eight prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is very symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in His alignment .
thus he receives the most exact ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even how it rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
quite a lot is capable of models , the rest is learned right at the fly .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines are to be part of our every day , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller air machines .
these moves in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them , they act like a high @-@ performance cop@@ cop@@ ter .
but goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited .
we will demonstrate the now by opening a half .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we attended commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread - and equi@@ pping them with localization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will mo@@ tivate you to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine over there would like to become a f@@ el@@ ong@@ ated lamp@@ shade .
of course it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wages is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowing them to form in so spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago , in a very distant galaxy , two black holes are spinning each other ever faster , they walked as mass tri@@ mmer in a ti@@ tu@@ ce ti@@ dings in pure energy around .
for this short moment they sh@@ ew@@ ed brigh@@ ter as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put their energy in the form of light --
we speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been handed down into the space time frame by itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events at first time .
1,3 billion years ago had just ar@@ isen life on the earth .
since then the earth has seen a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ri@@ ans , men and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , a group decided especially coura@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss of M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about by col@@ li@@ zing black holes .
most of them kept them crazy .
but enough people realized them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard @-@ hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ er- and gravity @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase what the recognition performance increased enormously .
therefore it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
in early September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a last trial to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ ill @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cists on M@@ IT . he has been studying the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through observ@@ atories as LIG@@ O measurable signals . what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the insert of space and time .
passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other .
for the illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses to rel@@ ativity have often a really alistic dance .
&quot; stretching and p@@ aces , stretching and bar@@ ks . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched out during the meeting of the waves and gest@@ ures . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 Therefore , you declared the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length should have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic force . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text over grav@@ itation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves in the way : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are aw@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are dark , and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claims , LIG@@ O be more of the ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial trains , the size of your mobile phone .
that is quite handy . because in this way you can customize a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you .
in the sounds is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much :
the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain characteristics as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it .
&quot; now just Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ bi@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
with them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the universe .
but by observing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least lie for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave patterns in Sch@@ all , we can literally hear the all literally .
the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been very busy .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ates simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , one sounds the same circle with an additional key change . it sounds like : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ined in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listened to LIG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to listen to what he must listen , knows this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which will turn about as soon as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : if we are thinking about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns which revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the steady importance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O has a completely new path to the discovery of the universe as it has never been possible .
on this path we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ king stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about space .
the exciting physical processes occur but at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon .
we will never be able to see , because they are op@@ a@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves perme@@ ate iron , as if it were transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , as the urine is hin@@ dered by his own offspring .
it should be possible through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen before , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , LIG@@ O found the same in the first attempt things we did not expect .
my colleague at M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes , such as LIG@@ O they are observing , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so @-@ called the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ ds for our arche@@ ological work .
LIG@@ O allows us to completely different perspectives on the events of the universe , to the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now consists of being as coura@@ geous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the ru@@ stling and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories in Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it was nervous to me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I begin to play with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared , weigh@@ ed me out my fear .
my fear , to hold words , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , that my life deeply changed , to an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my smallest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; treasures , &quot;
as if it were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies , I need milk for my beak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there , I swe@@ ar to play with them always , as soon as you ask me to do it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I comp@@ ass me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only recently , I really understood that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saved my career to play with my children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things out , we@@ aving you to life .
dreams job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dreams job .
I scre@@ ire television . I am producing television .
I am television , in a great style .
in this TV season I am responsible to spread over 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production simultaneously .
every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ sheet can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode all nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , four hours TV , three broad@@ casts , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series are running on Thursday morning .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ous . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world burn .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan .
dreams job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &apos; author &apos; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you are doing now a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , to understand that I am not just around the computer ro@@ cking and un@@ imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job of dreams .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- do not tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I get into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
when I put troops on , when I put troops on a canvas .
this way you can find a high tone , lying down a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work it .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and mat@@ ernal , cruel and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable , and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me if the work is well running .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows and the bu@@ zz sound like a bustling street , I could go for always on her .
many people take part if I declare to them the bu@@ zz that I &apos;m persu@@ aded that writing was pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , what does it do .
but the money , when I started working with television production , when I began to work and working and working together , I discovered this thing , this money , this energy . the sums !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sums is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you cannot look different to size .
the feeling , not otherwise can be compared to size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I am not working for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want it to question .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more w@@ ells , the more w@@ rest@@ less borders , the more work there are , the more things more watching me , the more I write history , all the more expectations there .
the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love job , not true ?
the land , I created the marathon , the marathon , I walk , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this money . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the money . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
revised , over@@ exposed , exagger@@ ated , hidden .
the sums of money stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a only work place .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard .
the amount of the engine was reduced .
I don &apos;t really loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the money came not back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ day , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing of the deleg@@ ate , does not give up , with whol@@ eh@@ e@@ art@@ edly , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre@@ view @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the money and the money I was .
so what makes you do if that , what you do , the work that you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ay you out , sil@@ ly the author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do what you do , one loves to be a teacher to be a master , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves just another and that gives one of the sums you know when the bu@@ zz knew how to stop the bu@@ zz , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in the silence ?
and then I put my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , you are playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than two things :
first , I must say Yes to everything and secondly , they don &apos;t called me . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; che@@ ek@@ y . &quot;
when is that happening ?
I cle@@ ver@@ ly it if I am Titan and my bu@@ zz be@@ ating , and here everything is changing my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , Can you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters encounter this , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of total , I can do nothing but to match .
I am focused .
I am sil@@ ently .
the land , which I create , the marathon , the I walk , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist anymore .
everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and wet k@@ isses , delicate voices , wax and the song , in which it &apos;s going to be slo@@ ping , or whatever the girl put in &quot; The Eis@@ k@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is releas@@ ing itself .
a mental door is going on and an energy cher@@ ub comes in .
and that was not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the money , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know an magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the Titan@@ ic sum@@ p , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I am compl@@ ying with broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money is not an effort and it is not working @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on pleasure .
the real money is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
the real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real money ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the respon@@ sive tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real money is simple and original .
the real money &apos;s voice is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ per@@ ed God the wrong words , because which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I &apos;m doing this as a rule , so I can rid myself as work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums over again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not based on me just like working .
the truth does hurt ,
but I do not like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace as at home .
this con@@ fession is painful , because what a person would rather than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes honest , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we are back in the garden , ahead and back , forth and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and playing ball .
we melt soap bub@@ bles .
here I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ly , absent and confused .
I always ri@@ pe up to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! do they always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you probably are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? they are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones will want to play at most 15 minutes with me , till they mon@@ g up that they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or K@@ eks get replaced .
and speak to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more requires not for it .
everyone can catch a 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood @-@ day !
15 minutes a bit !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids prayed .
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my prosperity , my world . it must not be the children . it is considered to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
I am not perfect in it . I van@@ ity and I sing . friends meet to read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in education as I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not get full 15 minutes ?
what can I be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the sums appear then to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to a unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas . I use it in full and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the money , the sums it is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the amount of work is part of me , but just one part . and for this I am so grateful .
I &apos;m snow@@ ing that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan Poker , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and nevertheless I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the more lucky me and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clearly my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country , which I create , the marathon , the tro@@ op , the tro@@ op , the sums , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the sums of life .
the more I feel this money , the more this unusual , enthusiastic , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I awake you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream@@ job should be a little fo@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability of self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous system through various surgical measures .
sure , they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; low @-@ stag stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to affect the control circuits of neur@@ ons , that the neurological function has improved .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered under severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to it .
with a little help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading th@@ ologist and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with sk@@ ull @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain is stra@@ igh@@ ted and the sk@@ ull head grows .
in order to save life , it is necessary to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull .
to do this , one sometimes needs to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to leave cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to be able to grow cells from a tissue , comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many experiments there were Jean @-@ François .
that looked at his micro@@ scope under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know still from the bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ zers that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share themselves very quickly .
you never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells stopped different .
they were shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ child @-@ eye cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why are they going to receive us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of an potential cellular source , which enables brain power .
this was what we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the non@@ language area and then the cells can be as cul@@ tiv@@ ating as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they are subsequently vali@@ date to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we r@@ alled it at the reception of the same individual .
we call the psych@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ge@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we present these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are r@@ hy@@ per the same cells in bra@@ id brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario , we present the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , they were taken back home . the room is already filled , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we found an injury to and r@@ hy@@ mes precisely the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed and mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were r@@ hy@@ bri@@ des .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro in the culture .
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so @-@ sty@@ led monkeys with a manual de@@ priv@@ ation task .
you had to take feed p@@ ellets by a tray .
they did this very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we went to the motor mix@@ er in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they recovered spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , which reco@@ vering spontane@@ ously .
it can provide approximately 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from infringement .
it is not as accurate and not so fast .
let &apos;s see now when we re@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after maturity .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we found much more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and later use them later .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ate them to humans .
I really hope , that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the public , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need it . &quot;
I definitely come .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human subjects .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission for launching clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes , until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it permit us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
one simply has to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thanks for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider her as an un@@ changing spirit .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big neigh@@ im@@ mer in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , the democracy over@@ comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambiguous with me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not have to influence the divisions that have been realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you to believe in common with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group an error , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ ous democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are behind one , our future dark and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the forgiveness of debt who casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the forgiveness of debt ,
only a few recognize its Gem@@ ini @-@ Gem@@ ini @-@ Gem@@ ini @-@ Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is one of the poor spar@@ es and corporations , which could be too frigh@@ tened there , where it would be productive and income , with which you could carry the debt crisis and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months in the US , in England and in the eurozone , 3.4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars invested to invest in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , gas , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars worth a lot of money until one compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ lli@@ on US dollars , which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which does not express itself through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe work , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that will boost the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest . just like o@@ edi@@ pus father , who would not invest this self . just like o@@ edi@@ pus father , who would not invest this self . just like o@@ edi@@ pus father , who would not be afraid of fear that his son would kill him if he grows ,
un@@ inten@@ tional the circumstances bring about that o@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ th@@ under with capitalism --
his extremely harsh art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further improve our lives , develop human talents and to finance especially all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive in the salvation of the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I think . but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed to many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , there would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these ex@@ ams .
the decisi@@ vely of the ath@@ ic democracy was and is , that it was the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more decisive , giving them the right to political co@@ determination with the same voting rights in matters of the state .
the ath@@ ic democracy has not been kept for a long time --
as a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly spread out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our current liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Magna C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy was focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of ancient Magna C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our current democr@@ acies , since the time when the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ or@@ able struggle between the two , as the economy gradually hi@@ ked the policy and exposed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power , because the power of politics is cut down into the economy and separated the areas .
I mentioned my ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in such a way a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which sustain@@ ing the animals of which it nour@@ ishes itself , that they are star@@ ving at the end therefore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy which politics is so far @-@ ni@@ zed by the self @-@ causing economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods is being de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more successful capitalism transformed the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin above , and all the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; remains in control , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go well .
the doctrine of the de@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a stand like in the antique Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ ying through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation will be higher and lower , the waste of the twin , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ forming the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in this respect we consider the re@@ unified field of democracy , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring bureaucracy that can appear in the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced , survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a D@@ yst@@ top@@ ia , similar to that in the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machinery serve the people and the people to invest their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ ones ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the field of companies , please make sure that you earn a capital market , in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will assist you from a work@@ station to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one just works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and income and the concept of wage work is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not a pi@@ vot@@ al distinction between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no more temporal tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please state that our national currencies could have a free vac@@ ant exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest neighboring countries &#93; , in the interest of the whole of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call them &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum that matches the deficit of trade or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies especially in parts of the world where investments are ra@@ ids .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have it , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world that I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which they privileged people pre@@ fers , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , globally key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide to work together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ union of politics and business is ... do not doing this , technological development is causing such a massive decline in the economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer is called &quot; long term st@@ agnation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies but also the countries whose interests in liber@@ alism is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely s@@ wir@@ t .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you do not rest , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers , you said very clearly what you keep from the sight of the West in China .
want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a fully democratic @-@ free zone .
in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles today the England of the 19th century .
for -- you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about what democratic development concerns .
what can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many people are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I framed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency and the continuous denial that the eurozone is going through the eurozone and continues to thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to go on the basis of Greek proposal - who , by the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial --
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European Group , continues to have chosen denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get a economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism into life , it might be hes@@ it@@ ant for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change do you look ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a Finance Minister or any Minister , who is in office for 6 months , especially in such an tense situation , he made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
obviously I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake had to sign the request for the extension of the debt recovery at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the don@@ or , a common solution to find .
but that was not that .
they only wanted to bring our government to the case , only because they don &apos;t want to deal with the conv@@ ul@@ sions created by the eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nom@@ inate GDP .
there &apos;s worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika credi@@ tors that have imposed us this policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ke@@ ons of the talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone facing someone who lives and loves the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the redund@@ an@@ ists will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy .
it will not be dis@@ astro@@ us alone for Europe but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we let ourselves strike the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after that it appears , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans like even the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of us have never heard , though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production facility of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a ir@@ oning and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for getting the shows and the content at Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ struggling industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any one .
he must find shows who are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this corner .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this assessment .
your show will be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after having a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle class , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price is going to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest off .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch any photo for free .
and if Amazon is out for nothing things to do , it &apos;s right ?
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed during the watch of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who take it all .
you capture , when you start the show when you break , which parts you are ski@@ ps or viewing it .
they collect millions of data to decide on this data which show they should produce .
in fact , they accum@@ ulate the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four re@@ publi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average @-@ show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House has an average of 7.5 -- something over the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time at another company , another manager is placed a top show by Data Analysis . its name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program designs of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always in search of finding this a super show , and he also uses data for it but he does something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to figure out these small details about the viewers : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
you have two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because the logic somehow meant that this should work in everything .
if you accum@@ ulate millions of data , for a decision that you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years on statisti@@ c as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by a very powerful computer .
what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analytics is not working so this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
are someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room can ever be in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the United States and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . it is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google is doing some errors .
2009 , Google announced that they can predi@@ ct the dis@@ bur@@ sts of flu , the sm@@ lim@@ men way , predi@@ ctions -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great message sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ less , year round year until it suddenly doesn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed up firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understanding something .
in spite of all these errors the data streams falling into decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the judicial system , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based Genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized a few patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
you have to solve ever a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as First , you create this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a wide you put the parts again to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things to take apart and sit down again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help make a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to reset the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again comp@@ ose , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of a expert .
so , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong to the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they otherwise would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show , which meant they went a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices first than they had about TV @-@ ideas , then selected as &quot; Alpha House &quot; as Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they say to us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and to not forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &apos; Magic 8 Ball &apos; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ar or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &apos; most likely &apos; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will be performing it later with a technology .
so far I have taken some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in the after@@ math .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it by something much lower , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic building .
so perhaps the ball will give wis@@ er and clever and clever . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I emp@@ t this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays , decisions to make an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land on the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
