<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You probably know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen, wrote a book in which it was spectacular published that the NSA illegally owned by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should make a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence surgery, in which the CIA was literally drained by Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "almost 10 years the government was established against Risen and asked him to call its alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers to judge and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they do so.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government used the iron ore, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused to himself and told that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, even though they were years of age, that it would be essential in its case, the demands of the government were dropped on rise." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can become more and less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and attaching to statements, this could also do their digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his telephone numbers were secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and risens evalleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary has more condemns than all the US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too far from their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of that whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work in the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Treaty, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology is allowed by the government to get the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in this way, they can take the right from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the night, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is Securedrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet illustrious, which was developed by us from Aaron Swartz, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I'm working, further developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news-site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information to any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the relevant message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government is unable to provide any information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "but" "" "SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop constantly new spying technologies that are jeopardizing us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology reasons such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to express misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abnormalities in the care of soldiers; or the next environmental workers, the alarm for contaminated water of Flint strikes. or a pilgrim insider which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data leck of the story published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that empires and motions] [we beaten Robert Palmer of Global Witness on a declaration.] this week we were conducted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosseca in Panama.] [...]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "also, there are reports that an Allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's harvesant firms in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's president Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">This sounds like the phlot of a Leki-agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems quietly away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we approach it?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful is able to hide their assets in tax havens, and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world debate media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by some of them to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people all this world really confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I still imagine it as a Matrjoschka manger.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans available in this revelations, that scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, according to which these tax havens work, Mosaic Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company as to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not allow scammers to rip especially incomparably investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigator in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as an African minister who wanted to bring even money to the US to buy a home, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all until a lawyer made our inquiries made proposals, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preoccupied. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anyone has been handed over money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer that spreads to our uncovered inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top trio, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very much trouble as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could have changed, as if it's always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as-born optimization, I really see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have witnessed more transparency in what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured the central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a legislative act in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress, which we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind their home companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the business that get up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and to stand up by laws this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end those kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazowes.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design study, I made a rear-back.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through whole land. after that he would go to the peace-corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you put it today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: Oh, Mann!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he is really plans. I don't want to end up in the luggage room of a Mazowland.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "How to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get there for me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild ranssleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on tiptoes at the door, and my sleeping room door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me depends on in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood are sold as strangers, actually friends who are just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To host people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is stepping out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow-inhabitants Brian Chesky: "Brian, I overlaid how we could earn anything about it. our apartment is designed for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three Happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood flooring.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes are completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We travelled with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door was in the castle, rigid Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things arrived in roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented ourselves to the investors: "we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one excludes if you come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still very at Trost, would invest in a business, strangers allows, in homes of other people to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you animate on the things that you can do well. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to desiged objects, but now we wanted to get up with the immense confidence, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design contribute something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we stripped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs high when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to lock that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlockable cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent book of panic, which you can now sense -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the hidden cell of a stranger in my hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who has actually Al Gordo's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce the Office of the President for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can withdraw the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had only once presented with his name: if he would have told how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 beats that all say: "he can really keep very well-spered phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system reinforces the confidence crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to release negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their assessments before we placed it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are related to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">A bit surprisingly we trust the people the most, who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social pre-biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, it changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we drove to trust that trust is dependent on how much you get reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, like for example "Hi!," you get rather not a reply.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell a lot, as:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I'm doing a vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create design with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds up hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned it was the great amount of people who were more than willing to settle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can realize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the indefatigable work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unallowed parties celebrated or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">"" "in the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all the phone calls came directly to my mobile phone." ""</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it does hurt, if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million closed overnight stays only a fraction of one problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, there may be miracle arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host gave him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to stay for residency activities due to current activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true protagonists who save a life even though they are not at all right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is of course not running any stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">"" "but these relationships behind the pure money transcription are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transits?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing does not do justice to it." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay up a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is with fast food to compare. it is efficient and reliable, but not less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if at any place you visited a group there would wait to show a group there, to show a thoroughly and one in a pub pentour neighborhoods, of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from ground to living?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have taken the idea of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine the cities which enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parks that belonged to the government</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered by inhabitants. students who were looking for a place,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved. there were cubator programs to be started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in Share Economy. through our platform alone, night, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted in numerous foreigners or hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep roasted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find the amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time about it if a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence I ask myself, for what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just simply a delay on the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their loggers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it is great, you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee house -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A cartetean Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sing, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I chose to wear the Hijab, my headgear.</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really Branches on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have smelled the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain yourself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">Those are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the human body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under review.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumour in the human body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-aid and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques or be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking places, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to view people of other faith-tolerant, and show greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I was a leader of the police in the Washington area of Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalisation process, one determined that it begins online. as First, the person is cut off from their church, even from her family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who despises their behavior and its ideology is a traitor or dislikes by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group as the IS reveals its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into their imagination, when one recognizes it as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, such as the Ku-club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claiming their ideology on their "Holy Book".</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one throws a look at it, she is not driving them what they read in their" Holy Scripture. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they perfected to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Being inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was an primary goal for instructing by extremists who spoke their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduces the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of complying with her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she did before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear each day affects our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We tend to accept an authorized governmental system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you preset test people news in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they were more military attack on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood rises to Muslims upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manifesting the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early Warnmark.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear swear us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assigning of collecticence it is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental centre, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generest man who knew she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his life. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did this book have become such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook site.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be amoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or remain safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We animate it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about the America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to get the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove to the mosque, with high pressure towards the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely refilled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and called our guests, for half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to attack, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment I have been collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure of that?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join them that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for crafting, is short before, to become a billion manger.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug teeth. it is made possible in research institutes around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-net access into our social awareness penetrated a autonomous fleet of aviation machines at the Frac Centre in France live a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting cars to a high speed and acceleration in narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear burdens to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential within the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it must know collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a flavors of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest image." "" "start" "" "and" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance-wards efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and thus has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of Heckstarters is that they react sensitively to turmoil like wind arcs.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is recovered and the performance by practicing can be improved.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that precede to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand movable parts, which work together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago could fly away-controlled air-controlled air equipment, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a halogen.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest control device. it has been invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-ruder, no other actuators or controversy, but a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much, so that it can fly stable and can move over to space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I must throw it right properly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right if all of you see, is low, so I show you a video which was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon is an exercise in genloneliness, this machine is here, the lumber with its eight propeller, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is very symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in His alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the most exact ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even how it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Quite a lot is capable of models, the rest is learned right at the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our every day, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller air machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These moves in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they act like a high-performance copcopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate the now by opening a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We attended commercial micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread - and equipping them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine over there would like to become a felongated lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wages is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowing them to form in so spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes are spinning each other ever faster, they walked as mass trimmer in a tituce tidings in pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they shewed brighter as all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they do not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been handed down into the space time frame by itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago had just arisen life on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has seen a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurians, men and -- God stand for us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group decided especially courageous -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise about by collizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard-hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer- and gravity-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO could considerably increase what the recognition performance increased enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was started for a last trial to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collizing black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todill-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists on MIT. he has been studying the gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories as LIGO measurable signals. what are the gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the insert of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">Passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For the illustration, lecturers in courses to relativity have often a really alistic dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and paces, stretching and barks."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched out during the meeting of the waves and gestures. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1 Therefore, you declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic force. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text over gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves in the way: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are awful.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are dark, and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims, LIGO be more of the ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial trains, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite handy. because in this way you can customize a picture or a map of things by watching the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the sounds is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics as sound and pitch, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dubimmer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by observing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lie for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns in Schall, we can literally hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been very busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulates simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, one sounds the same circle with an additional key change. it sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, engrained in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listened to LIGO: [Surrender noise] Somebody who knows what to listen to what he must listen, knows this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which will turn about as soon as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: if we are thinking about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns which revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the steady importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has a completely new path to the discovery of the universe as it has never been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masking stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur but at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never be able to see, because they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves permeate iron, as if it were transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, as the urine is hindered by his own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible through gravitational waves to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen before, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found the same in the first attempt things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes, such as LIGO they are observing, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so-called the sauerknods for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events of the universe, to the creation of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rustling and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories in Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it was nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">I wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I begin to play with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared, weighed me out my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to hold words, my social fear -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, that my life deeply changed, to an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all "treasures,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if it were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "cookies, I need milk for my beak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there, I swear to play with them always, as soon as you ask me to do it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I compass me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side-effect: only recently, I really understood that "" "" Yes "" "" I saved my career to play with my children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, weaving you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreams job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreams job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I screire television. I am producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible to spread over 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadsheet can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days times four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, four hours TV, three broadcasts, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television series are running on Thursday morning.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I have created and not only produced, so still obendous. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreams job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word 'author' falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you are doing now a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, to understand that I am not just around the computer rocking and unimaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job of dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- do not tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I get into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">When I put troops on, when I put troops on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This way you can find a high tone, lying down a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work it.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruel and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows and the buzz sound like a bustling street, I could go for always on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take part if I declare to them the buzz that I'm persuaded that writing was pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, what does it do.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the money, when I started working with television production, when I began to work and working and working together, I discovered this thing, this money, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you cannot look different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not otherwise can be compared to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not working for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want it to question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more wells, the more wrestless borders, the more work there are, the more things more watching me, the more I write history, all the more expectations there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love job, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, I created the marathon, the marathon, I walk, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this money. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overexposed, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums of money stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a only work place.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The amount of the engine was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't really loved my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans-work, 15 hours-day, performed weekends, no remorse, nothing of the delegate, does not give up, with wholeheartedly, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Preview-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the money and the money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you do if that, what you do, the work that you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hay you out, silly the author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do what you do, one loves to be a teacher to be a master, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves just another and that gives one of the sums you know when the buzz knew how to stop the buzz, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in the silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern states-waitress."</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mama, you are playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to everything and secondly, they don't called me. "</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "cheeky."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I cleverly it if I am Titan and my buzz beating, and here everything is changing my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, Can you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters encounter this, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of total, I can do nothing but to match.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silently.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, the I walk, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists is sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax and the song, in which it's going to be sloping, or whatever the girl put in "The Eiskgin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is releasing itself.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy cherub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that was not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the money, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know an magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the Titanic sump, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I am complying with broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "the money is not an effort and it is not working-specific." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the electricity that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real money ignores the pressure of the story, the responsive tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money's voice is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps I whispered God the wrong words, because which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this as a rule, so I can rid myself as workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums over again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not based on me just like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I do not like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a person would rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "sometimes honest, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are back in the garden, ahead and back, forth and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and playing ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We melt soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Here I feel overwhelmly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ripe up to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me for naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones will want to play at most 15 minutes with me, till they mong up that they want to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens up, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to a unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas. I use it in full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I do not love it.</seg>

<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little foaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability of self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous system through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure, they have heard of one of the most known, the "low-stag stimulation." in doing so, one electrode deep in the brain, in order to affect the control circuits of neurons, that the neurological function has improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading thologist and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-traumata the brain is straighted and the skull head grows.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to diminish the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, one sometimes needs to remove a part of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to leave cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To be able to grow cells from a tissue, comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many experiments there were Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That looked at his microscope under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know still from the biologiezers that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform itself into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share themselves very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">You never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandchild-eye cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they going to receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of an potential cellular source, which enables brain power.</seg>
<seg id="850">This was what we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain mass from the nonlanguage area and then the cells can be as cultivating as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are subsequently validate to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we ralled it at the reception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the psychologist Transplantation -- Autotrangeant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we present these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are rhyper the same cells in braid brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we present the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, they were taken back home. the room is already filled, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we found an injury to and rhymes precisely the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed and mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were rhybrides.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So-styled monkeys with a manual deprivation task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets by a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did this very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we went to the motor mixer in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, which recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide approximately 40% to 50% of its original performance from infringement.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Let's see now when we replanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implate them to humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope, that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the public, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who may need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely come.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission for launching clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes, until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it permit us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform and evaluate the treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One simply has to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider her as an unchanging spirit.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big neighimmer in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, the democracy overcomes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous with me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup - that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not have to influence the divisions that have been realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in common with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup an error, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenous democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are behind one, our future dark and our great new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin" "" "paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the forgiveness of debt who casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the forgiveness of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">Only a few recognize its Gemini-Gemini-Gemini-Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is one of the poor spares and corporations, which could be too frightened there, where it would be productive and income, with which you could carry the debt crisis and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion US dollars invested to invest in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, gas, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars worth a lot of money until one compares with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time spent in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which does not express itself through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe work, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that will boost the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest. just like oedipus father, who would not invest this self. just like oedipus father, who would not invest this self. just like oedipus father, who would not be afraid of fear that his son would kill him if he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentional the circumstances bring about that odipus kills him kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hathunder with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely harsh art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further improve our lives, develop human talents and to finance especially all of the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive in the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed to many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, there would be an error, the significance of the athic democracy due to these exams.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisively of the athic democracy was and is, that it was the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more decisive, giving them the right to political codetermination with the same voting rights in matters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not been kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">As a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly spread out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our current liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens." ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy was focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of ancient Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy - thus the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone became.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our current democracies, since the time when the separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two, as the economy gradually hiked the policy and exposed it." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it is possible to be in the government today and still not in power, because the power of politics is cut down into the economy and separated the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in such a way a flock of carnivores, which sustaining the animals of which it nourishes itself, that they are starving at the end therefore.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy which politics is so far-nized by the self-causing economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods is being devaluated, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism transformed the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin above, and all the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy together, and it would be better if the "demos" remains in control, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the deakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a stand like in the antique Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing Niedriglohnying through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation will be higher and lower, the waste of the twin, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reforming the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in this respect we consider the reunified field of democracy, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring bureaucracy that can appear in the film "matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced, survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a Dysttopia, similar to that in the "matrix," in which machinery serve the people and the people to invest their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like, how could it look like this "star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystones?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please make sure that you earn a capital market, in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will assist you from a workstation to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one just works -- is property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and income and the concept of wage work is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not a pivotal distinction between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no more temporal twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please state that our national currencies could have a free vacant exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest neighboring countries], in the interest of the whole of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call them "the Cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government is paying the sum that matches the deficit of trade or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is invested in "green" technologies especially in parts of the world where investments are raids.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have it, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe to you is at the same time liberated, in which they privileged people prefers, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar Dystones" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunion of politics and business is... do not doing this, technological development is causing such a massive decline in the economic demand that Larry Summer is called "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interests in liberalism is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and as Keynes, and that is why I am also completely swirt.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not rest, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers, you said very clearly what you keep from the sight of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a fully democratic-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say that provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- you remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about what democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>

<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European Group, continues to have chosen denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism into life, it might be hesitant for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you look ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes made in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Finance Minister or any Minister, who is in office for 6 months, especially in such an tense situation, he made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Obviously I made mistakes.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of us have never heard, though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a ironing and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for getting the shows and the content at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-struggling industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows who are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the assessment goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show will be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "" "" -- all the shows, the addictive, where, after having a season, your brain asks: "" "" where is there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle class, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price is going to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest off.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch any photo for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is out for nothing things to do, it's right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed during the watch of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who take it all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show when you break, which parts you are skips or viewing it.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide on this data which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they accumulate the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom via four republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average-show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House has an average of 7.5 -- something over the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time at another company, another manager is placed a top show by Data Analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program designs of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always in search of finding this a super show, and he also uses data for it but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to figure out these small details about the viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has thus hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow meant that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you accumulate millions of data, for a decision that you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years on statistic as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">What you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analytics is not working so this is something frightening because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Are someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope none in this room can ever be in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a discharge is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. it is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google is doing some errors.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that they can predict the disbursts of flu, the smlimmen way, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great message sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawless, year round year until it suddenly doesn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed up firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstanding something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors the data streams falling into decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the judicial system, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based Genetics -- an area where some very clever people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized a few patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve ever a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As First, you create this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a wide you put the parts again to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things to take apart and sit down again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help make a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reset the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again compose, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of a expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">So, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they otherwise would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" which did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show, which meant they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices first than they had about TV-ideas, then selected as "Alpha House" as Show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they say to us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and to not forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called 'Magic 8 Ball'. it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaar or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. 'most likely' -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will be performing it later with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have taken some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it by something much lower, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic building.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will give wiser and clever and clever. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I empt this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays, decisions to make an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land on the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
