Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the lon@@ es@@ ful reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is nervous when land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had already hit exciting because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a green meadow showed a green meadow .
the historic maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of Munich &apos;s history area since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft that can be seen as such .
in the large map of over @-@ card , towns and municipalities have been identified more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter op .
these emerged according to the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ measurable administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originates from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War of Directors with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ o@@ graphical capture of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes .
even if the French troops le@@ ashed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours were the idea of an area @-@ covered Bavaria card created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , set up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ o@@ graphical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Certificate of Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found all the other on the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison early / Today is the most impressive one in the example of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown rapidly .
an example of this is sub@@ end@@ end@@ ling , which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was included 21 years after the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Mün@@ chner district .
today , it is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Spring focus around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance : while gaz@@ ing appears a small dis@@ advant@@ aged card with do@@ zens lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots from the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pri@@ des &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; derived from the basic tax . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not occupy farmers today more - but a gar@@ den@@ er of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of sub@@ end@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 Schau@@ square of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the jungle leaf@@ let you read in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ sta@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the au@@ er@@ field roads you were able to once kill people with mad@@ ness .
there were 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt founded in the Au@@ er Lü@@ der . &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard ( G@@ ud@@ der ) headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought to the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he is forbidden to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ de , who is interested in an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients first place was first place , later was expanded to 500 places .
sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 there is the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Clinic in Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
the former interior of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt are now meeting young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the medal awarded the buildings in 1920 and walked in a youth home with educational establishments .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , one set up the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural pl@@ agues to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ pen@@ um that had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bom@@ ben@@ an@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Head square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , the department of the department was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a bag@@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once celebrated at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the pr@@ enti@@ ation and take place on 5 April 2017 of sp@@ ading for the second S @-@ Bahn platform .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
bourgeois group published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the National Foundation for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for colour @-@ colored people , which are travelling to Mis@@ souri due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks by the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory board for the Federal State Mis@@ souri , which will come into force up to 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ ri@@ ans to be guided through the state , as a series of do@@ d@@ worthy , rac@@ ist @-@ based pre@@ inci@@ dents appear at the last time throughout the country and be noted , &quot; said it is in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri which makes it people harder to win discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are squee@@ zed or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints with such a frequency which we have not heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organisation for a State in the United States .
the group cited as rac@@ ist approach against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ mentary circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri without a crime .
the Council also points to a recent publication of the office of the general state @-@ old from Mis@@ souri , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wheat .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Mis@@ souri &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready if they are chew@@ ing , or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri came to 100 @-@ hate in 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the Hass@@ le @-@ breaking report of the F@@ BI , which acc@@ esses the state with respect to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Society ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration laws had to commit to conce@@ al the local pro@@ secution authorities , which will contribute to further li@@ festyles , according to the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warning are usually issued by the State Department for other countries but in recent times , stakeholders have the action to act as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Sor@@ ted project is elementary
the fishing bacher wheat @-@ project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter white and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided an image on site .
in the rectangle of the Swi@@ dem@@ ann family , representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U troops met by Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of MEPs .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann gave first insights into his company , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and as well as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative path of alternative for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of holiday guests only regi@@ on@@ ales happens .
since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of fishing bach , he said the Wei@@ dec@@ aying project as &quot; elementary project . &quot;
I can not manage on such steep land .
the green area for a lot of work , much must be edited by the motorbike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental business and rest@@ ruc@@ tured these without chemical @-@ plant protection and fertilizers , even though it is not a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the turn@@ down project and is happy with the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers must be supported .
I hope that the affor@@ est@@ ation of the areas could still be pulled out quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and making thoughts about how they put their operation , &quot; said the Mayor .
farmers are often living in criticism due to the promotion
a total of 25 participants from eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the Pres@@ er@@ ation surface is around 40 hectares , which must not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
the overall cost of € 71 500 was funded by the overall cost of 71 500 euro , a quarter carried the municipality of fishing .
so they hi@@ des the farmer 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of turn@@ around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even for Peter Weiss stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ s@@ cour@@ ses@@ ame ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ ur@@ ns .
the Go@@ al is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the presence is the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the ext@@ ant area may not be broken down ( hang@@ ings over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with the affor@@ est@@ ation .
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dec@@ aying project 2018 , currently the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots that would like to build just 16 kilometers of Zau@@ n .
the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the statue of Liberty before
the safest character of a regime change is when they begin to push the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam H@@ uss@@ one at the Fir@@ dos Place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic t@@ xt against Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N over the proposals of the President for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Mill@@ er did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat land@@ owners and liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have compens@@ ated him if he had done it .
but he laid their significance on , and in particular the importance that you were added as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta c@@ aded : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a full thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem which you refer to , later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is fac@@ tu@@ ally right , but as he formulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the sc@@ atter@@ ing words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only have any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your effort@@ less , your arms , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who are longing for , free to breathe , / the falling waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there has never been a time in which the &quot; el@@ ding waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Mill@@ er was not committed to literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is in fact a conflict on the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves into place their words after their death on the basis - did very well that they have been performing a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can by demonstrating the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an un@@ used classical image of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ actions - she has received a voice .
and she also gives himself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change from the right wing this long time .
the great cry as rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , which the American flame goes into the re@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something razor .
the importance of the statue is altogether and certainly a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus existed to see them as they had seen from the sublime , miserable , but hop@@ eless people after long and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it &apos;s about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp are ever to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds on a while when only two banknotes had belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power direc@@ torate of the L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can contribute a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
black believes in Scotland something special , and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals cont@@ enders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flow@@ - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen from the crew to the team member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ span@@ ie is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their surrender was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and genuine feel , the E@@ ili@@ ie , of course , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth Silver medal prize , which is represented at its fifth World Championship in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 sc@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ track Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has put up five British and two European records in the past year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m is another Scot@@ sman , which one should be watching the victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mann@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captain Chap@@ ters said that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great pride &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team but in some cases the medals and the fin@@ alists are also involved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honor to know , but to know that my team @-@ mate have voted for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to ascend to Po@@ dies .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of cri@@ tically about Facebook : b@@ wir@@ t you not to wear a public office if you cannot wear the he@@ ap of voters
the father of our country knew something of poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers smote him because of all , from the internal policy to its political principles .
he embr@@ aces in the cri@@ tique , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and wor@@ dless we will be guided as the sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who must work towards more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil War Cri@@ ed him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the cry from the governor , left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in managing its state and strict observance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and to debate its ha@@ ar@@ less head after chemotherapy on his page .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the site of the Gover@@ nor - the public domain is designated as officially and by collabor@@ ators paying by public taxes - need@@ lessly and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ person on the acts of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of the comments were nothing more than a mediation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ water filled people who vibr@@ ate on the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a pastor , no comfort .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ icient .
the parish priest drew the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same issue , then they are used by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the governor , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would others call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment will be deleted .
it &apos;s a lot of cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical points , and to burn or to bear prot@@ esters and to silence .
but that is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official that he critici@@ zed to Facebook and other social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp is initiated by Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County negoti@@ ates the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a elec@@ torate from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous po@@ ach@@ ers proposed to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseud@@ onyms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain , will be overwhel@@ med by his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , opinion and dis@@ courses are part of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home in the next three days since Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organized the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year by side in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the En@@ dr@@ on , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new court site and acts as a tournament ambass@@ ador in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how it reaches its glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is an ins@@ ult fe@@ eder this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career , both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly close , &quot; said the one in South@@ port native Player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura open since it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special to me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European senior tour following his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion on the ground floor .
this event will be the first Scottish concert since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid Golf .

less lung cancer by hand @-@ smoking
more and less people died in the last two decades due to passive exposure to lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , a year of 167 of lung cancer is attribut@@ able to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Studien@@ ter Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when compared , he took up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there have been still 400 lung cancer due to pas@@ sports crimes per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;

in the area of domestic connections , the location is more complicated than suspected , because in the underground there is much ver@@ ic@@ eb@@ erg@@ s , which may not be noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is continually ham@@ per@@ ed by the construction , presents a major problem for the rup@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists in front of red traffic lights and shut @-@ off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they do not use a stove .
they even use rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rac@@ tor in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is normally called a sweet potato - locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the bon@@ ded l@@ ol@@ le with ze@@ al@@ ous , s@@ inu@@ ated hands are drawn and eng@@ ul@@ fed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work , e.g. clothes with dec@@ ep@@ y water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a l@@ atex .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were assigned no fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary .
of course , late may be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are heavy and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one w@@ aks to move around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 El@@ der should vote before the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that stems from the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which administr@@ ates control of the region and excl@@ u@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitoring .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea in the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo and cor@@ ru@@ gated roofs , which were converted by r@@ ust into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans got a god called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirts and their bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indonesian in the province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ mor@@ tal and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine from the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a plateau of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has built Free@@ port in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollar gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a lot of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s empowerment has a sublime presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 have paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and become mer@@ ciful .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 of the Indonesian military and were tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass evaluations in Pap@@ ua &apos;s high@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1980s have been genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on Gen@@ o@@ cide .
in the region alone the Indonesian police had more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region .
&quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value the Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in a report from the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities have been included in the prior year , such as un@@ lawful Hin@@ ts and torture - rape and electro@@ ass@@ ings are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as any week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , since pap@@ uas resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes themselves as Muslim economic forces from the pop@@ ulous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell ro@@ cked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep in mind .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local which attracted to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has tasted the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , in the Volk@@ mar and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign to address the inequalities and the infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann received 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua a little changes , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in her tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , hunting and smote the group with their ri@@ f@@ ade , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard done that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was set in fire by the nearby government Commission and the things escal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together at a football field before the local police station and the military com@@ mander in order to request justice .
they carried out cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle constantly and a bird @-@ s@@ ang im@@ i@@ ti@@ ze - from Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to s@@ mu@@ te stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers had sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses had more than three times , shoot it dead , &quot; it is in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for tranquility and called for the multitude to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but tells that the ball came from the ranks of the troops gathered here .
&quot; it was packed , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w has been hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and studied his body to be sure he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears the name of Indonesia only a name , the TI@@ ME in dis@@ courage mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kiss@@ ed him . &quot;
the chief @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters said that his officers &quot; wanted their station &quot; only &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner of Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others in@@ ju@@ red .
the messages about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; by Jakarta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in which he sympath@@ ies on sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved promptly , so that in the future it will no longer happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for subsi@@ dy of historic human rights ab@@ uses .
but the failures began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the violations occur a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ ing made a withdrawal when he spoke in Jakarta on 5 June in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said , he did not establish any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ ing that accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which said more than 1,000 deaths in East tim@@ ors bloody independence from 1999 said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
family of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims of gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , are afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was be@@ aten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceas@@ ed .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , which refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were in@@ ju@@ red , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ f , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
established vill@@ agers were prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers saw stones on officers , who re@@ acted upon it by war@@ ring nuts .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and sle@@ w a sle@@ w .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who has been near the hospital and witness , as the last one here has been sent quickly , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hi@@ des two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to attract the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the Police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ple@@ a for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensual development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the stem of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many join the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by att@@ acking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ PM guide are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pretext of the &quot; backing of national sovereignty . &quot;
some do not dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; portable , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is for native to expensive .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaves vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic inequalities between native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which since opening new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers have arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs there are in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the president of the Chief of the Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , limitations of the reporting international media are tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ lle Long@@ sle@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Vice @-@ President Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , the limitations of reporting up to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from the most ignor@@ ant provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ uas .
in March we called for six paci@@ f@@ fishes - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically considered the O@@ PM .
the speaker from the Indonesian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the pr@@ sp@@ ans of the Group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia still holds a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want to take note of more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to a source having participated in the session but remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua will say that they will probably not be vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pl@@ ush , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief of the Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that there is under the constant threat of a military military , located in arms educ@@ ators and health services .
g@@ ai tells that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; which he has to rep@@ ay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Qu@@ us@@ sia resulted in a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they will never come as justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with ges@@ tic@@ ated head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire grasp the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai &apos;s book and forced hundreds of inhabitants , coming from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt in just two years by the flood , which one is called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming up people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran@@ ged the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to down , &quot; told a residents who called his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 pm local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) the fire sol@@ ves and the building was inter@@ cooler .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage was caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation .
in the UK said the police , she believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ sting at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June will have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ce in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Court of tennis ( IT@@ F ) is with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winner , W@@ afer @-@ thin does not support from the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact that is often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ sentence @-@ classics remain the traditional competi@@ tor .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the purpose of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not only in the vote was before the proposal came before the proposal to carry out the finale in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will be in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future last year in the first round the host law will have .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements will be facilitated at training places , etc. and players will have to complete up the Davis Cup less official media dates .
more than 1 out of 5 US travellers re@@ produces items in the plane , takes a survey
a survey among passengers sur@@ rendered that more than 20 percent are conscious or un@@ consciously har@@ dened objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , whereas the aircraft were transported , while they bore it acci@@ dentally missed kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they would have discovered late that they have been mist@@ aken with arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - those of a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - also stated that younger travellers are more ab@@ using the rules .
of the respon@@ dents that they asked that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were prohibited .
the most common objects that were inten@@ sely affected by T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to , enqu@@ iring to have borne articles with Klin@@ gen through the safety control , while 2.4 per cent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they have inten@@ tional drugs taken into the plane .
the company said it was inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware brought about by the airport security , and how many of it would be pur@@ pos@@ ely done .
it &apos;s no surprise that the people who s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ y@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - because of safety wear , those were most often flying .
however , the company points out that T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain which liquids may take them , or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the biggest quantity of the conf@@ is@@ cated items by the T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated items .
a time long thought the people , the T@@ SA could book books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers to cancel order
elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k gives a huge number of pre@@ orders for its new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has hitherto under@@ estimated that a part of the customers had already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the continually tri@@ umph@@ ant figures , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has the first time betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellation of the new mass @-@ model model 3 .
Mus@@ k was often applied in the past few months with more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , the delivery starts just beginning .
now Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have already been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
for a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently available 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations prior to , sp@@ te mus@@ k in a phone conference with an@@ alysts are registered .
that the cancellation of up to now roughly twelve percent of all orders become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
its argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth target lies not in demand , but on the output .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered .
by 2018 , there will be - all models assembled - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently per day 1800 reservations .
who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be delivered in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new , yet never in the practice of tested production roads without major interrup@@ tions with maximum utilisation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then , the company can not prevent the satisfied customers from acquiring away in dro@@ ves .
EPA @-@ Chief P@@ ru@@ sted withdraw from the rules of Obama Administr@@ ative rules to reduce emissions
one day after being lam@@ ents from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ sted , the boss of the Environmental Protection Authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions smo@@ g causing air in@@ ad@@ ins .
P@@ ru@@ ism presented the change when his agency proved to be faster than previous vulner@@ ability to the needs of the state environmental authorities .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was lifted up against his previous site in a Federal Ministry Tribunal .
it is a deadline which ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the 2015 standards of bott@@ om@@ it o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ sted announced in June that he will delay adher@@ ing to a year to give its authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ sted , who in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma it was a long time to take over environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ sted has repeatedly rev@@ itali@@ zed to block regul@@ ators , or delay in which chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels should res@@ ist .
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the Reg@@ ulations regulatory @-@ back agenda .
last month , a Military Tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce met@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ sted P@@ ru@@ sted that his turn@@ around in o@@ zone are simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not kept its deadlines for conducting and then waiting to be indi@@ cted by activists and others , and in an agreement to establish the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ sted that EPA has denied more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that there is us , seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA opinion that P@@ ru@@ sted some point out his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available means to ensure that regulations &quot; based on solid policies and the best available information are based . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ settlement of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month of approved legislation , the implementation of rules shall be passed by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
the New Yorker &apos;s general state attorney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who established the coalition of the states that glu@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA is a major asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who p@@ ours in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil @-@ Oz@@ on occurs when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil plants , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere in sunlight respond .
the dispos@@ able smo@@ g can cause serious breathing difficulties in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ding surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worrying how much pressure it needs to get this rational step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp @-@ government , focusing on environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Anni@@ versary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the ancient cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 4 : 30 at a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made our friends and sponsors for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ f@@ ful Klein@@ od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg &apos;s premi@@ er certificate : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the driving church to tum@@ ults together with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the word according to the judgments on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the un@@ veil church also a magnificent court , one belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was beside the under@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village .
ancient cards from the time around the year 1600 conver@@ ged these historical circumstances .
the patron saint was built out of the early Middle Ages in the Middle Ages .
a Lord who built a church , worked with a pastor , continued to qualify for this church and could even swal@@ low this church too .
related to this was the right to use a pastor or bishop a new priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ys of the two are bar@@ ked at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were introduced and the bells are stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 17@@ 96 French troops par@@ ted near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs , and they used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church received in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from horns .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche broke off .
only the cherry and left you left .
in the New Year of the new year 18@@ 34 a storm the cherry tower and the half were rus@@ hed .
in order to prevent disaster , the tower was abandoned .
only the present Tur@@ m@@ c@@ row today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em was supported by the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as an organis@@ er , the friends and conveyor belts were invited to visit the ancient cemetery on Sunday , 16th July , the sixth Seren@@ ade on the ancient cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ G@@ ymnasi@@ um Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with wording of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
plac@@ er Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 pm .

the Seren@@ ade takes place only on dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for receiving the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ults and horns .
the friends and supporters of tum@@ our feel particularly committed to the homeland care , such as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to be insp@@ ected for approval of motorcycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim will not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned towards the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim joins itself &quot; has requested Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette were not allowed to have any wind turbines , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only existed at the border to swal@@ low a Wind@@ force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentr@@ ations of wind use for the rest of the land .
the zones should avoid a &quot; reduction &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which was approved by a change of the area of wind in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , which was not approved by the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirement , the authorised per@@ mitting authorization is still un@@ lawful and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of the things : the City Council decided prior to the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government is still up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; understanding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , at this point , the division of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been submitted in the circle of Vier@@ sen for last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it on the occasion to consider the matter once again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative course , the circle on Thursday did not want to express their content to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , construction of four per 200 meters high wind wheels .
already last year the company had participated in which the town of Vier@@ sen is in cash equi@@ val@@ ry with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great money closed .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand of all quad@@ rup@@ ed households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer four of the City Council gave a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , and a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ ashes together : woman dies with a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 am on L 333 , between Nieder@@ s@@ ard@@ s@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circuit ) .
a woman was in@@ ju@@ red in this affliction .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the provincial road remained locked for hours .
according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came with their passenger car as part of the accompanied driver with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion the L 333 in the direction Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ ar and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city center in September .
the commercial association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce the inhabitants of the shopping stroll into the city center .
like the president of the profession , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ mall &quot; is supposed to raise awareness of the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket merchandise .
according to this , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at night shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not just the inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als in radio , an internet video and printed bag that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , as Christian König .
the municipal department and business association cooperates with the Chamber of Industry and Chamber of Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this makes the commercial organization and the city into another stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Brun@@ nen@@ fest including mer@@ ging Sunday , discussions with all the tra@@ des@@ men and vor@@ tices to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the departure on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly opened or opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping out of the sight .
at the end , all would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the inner city - to landlords , the establishments of the whole city and associations .
it happened to overcome the or@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that made some of them , had king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Centre in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , compl@@ ained that at the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campa@@ ign@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the esteem of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners will also make clear that each citizen would be able to influence his direct intervention itself .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction , it came to a gas blast in the school building .
new further people were wounded .
in an on@@ blast in the U.S. city of Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine further have been in@@ ju@@ red , some of them heavily .

a man died as part of a school building during the explosion .
a first missed , later also was released dead .
among the dead it was a question of the school .
as a disaster , the authorities suspected work on a gas line .
during the holiday season a few people were held in front of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tru@@ mp set after per@@ ched trans@@ cription by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the fron@@ tal wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp asked for a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the U.S. president asser@@ ted him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall and said he said to him , &quot; These are not the press to say . &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall to the southern border of the United States , and sw@@ amped to pay Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ sters were also published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ ff , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence on trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the government Obama to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after having said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford mass@@ acre : activists carry rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and ru@@ mp@@ ed to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came with tissue to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ able strip transfer - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside out the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ittle the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams dis@@ cr@@ acked the silence as a young black man got cr@@ ush@@ ed by the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene which was played on July 22 , only a post @-@ position .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience are very real &quot; si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 side@@ walks has returned to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to em@@ ulate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged because of the mor@@ de .
&quot; it really is in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former member of Congress of Congress of Georgia and for a lifetime of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual remembran@@ ce of the Monroe community , that wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want pro@@ secution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot go into healing and reconciliation while we are receiving justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court medi@@ ator places a beg@@ ro@@ ud on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding forests were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch Process .
but none was ever charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on free foot for decades , we say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April 1946 , she made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the first time , in the summer , in the summer , in the summer of voting their voice .
about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ächter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle down - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that ru@@ mor in the city was that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins , Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from prison and get closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b embr@@ aced the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the Mor@@ de , this includes a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more striking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and if you vote , then this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra has led the annual post @-@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vivi@@ dly , att@@ acking and is rooted in a sort of profound racism , many believe in America that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to look at , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we then talk to all its ug@@ liness into all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen course and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ member since years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester are playing their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ tes@@ ters , and oppressed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , bl@@ ot@@ ted from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
r@@ ins@@ ing the fire .
there is a rest .
and then everybody breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still cr@@ ushing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black performers .
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there shifts the energy in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp@@ ly and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends by violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed in a mour@@ ning , stands over the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads on tri@@ lo@@ ed mi@@ tigation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice is breaking with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
one pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the street .
you have experienced nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing humidity , when Broo@@ ks carries them on a pilgrimage to the excavations of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until that point the Mor@@ es have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels compens@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes sound out of the song , Gre@@ ene invites people to come closer and insp@@ ected the corp@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
children ho@@ cken to their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wants to remember it .
after a few minutes we would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the mo@@ p away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ med Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ dic .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally struck by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience turns together with the actors for dinner .
at a table chat a white pair from Atlanta , stimulated over the sur@@ name with a black pair , that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski com@@ batt@@ led to find words , which sense the performance has left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who like to look and do what they like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is called the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks is holding court on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds us of the citizens &apos; rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ position is inspiring in a certain way , for it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , whoever does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

and then I wondered what are you doing .
take a social year , as there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?

Pear@@ son k@@ icks more 3,000 jobs and cr@@ ashes the dividend to rev@@ ital@@ ise the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate cut by 72 percent since another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the job super@@ structure , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already been lost in numerous 4,000 sites .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reductions in May in a third cost reduction program ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to rev@@ ital@@ ise a business that was hit by the fast step towards the digital learning .
the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year is unchanged , after spending an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier in case of su@@ icide
a mur@@ mur@@ derer has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several other in@@ ju@@ red , say proj@@ ections .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been in@@ ju@@ red , shared a statement of Nato .
in@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district also three civilians were killed .
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has made this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a mur@@ dered su@@ icide , two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the blast on Thursday evening was to happen as a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the last in a stable state can be treated and treated in the U.S. military hospital in the field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO forces in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which approximately 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ fre@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have done this attack .
on 31 May , an enormous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ guided troops imposed the Taliban by power in 2001 .
the violence underlines the pre@@ dominant security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp are weak@@ ened , increasing the number of US troops , the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in government , politics and especially in the calling of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani in particular .
EPA comes into decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g usually to complain about
the US @-@ American environmental authorities have a decision to delay a regulation of the Government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to include smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions which , after 15 states def@@ endants the agency due to the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA approved late on Wednesday to drive forward the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ au@@ ctions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is showing the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA @-@ chief Scott P@@ ru@@ es said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ wa had announced the EPA &apos;s intention to specify the O@@ zone conditions - in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , to specify where inc@@ isions have to be made to delay stri@@ c@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , voted on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to re@@ tire a wide range of environmental impact , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the impact of Democrats and nature groups which are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA tells that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce the reaction symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
community wants to be communal space
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts the council acts by Flu@@ orn @-@ winds , the establishment of a community in the future elderly .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining land @-@ piece was signed , said Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it still will take , until the so far the parish community belongs to the church property , but there is now no planning of planning for that of a private investor to a emerging project anymore .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat are offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would be a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with approximately 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the community were ho@@ vers that such a common room can not appear as a meeting place just for residents of the sen@@ ti@@ ent living , but open to the church .
as an example the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round .
if the decision is made , the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the establishment of a common area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent shar@@ per .
the proposed resolution looks to signal the investor that in this respect it is no bil@@ let between the legs and wants to determine that both Satt@@ el@@ - and ambient temperature - as well as pl@@ ult@@ ding - which makes the tear of economic power - was possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this promise .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously pass the body on board .
not so easy it is with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which one cannot move so much for that Leh@@ i can now be with the common room from the window , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Stadium are absolutely essential for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ vention to any high @-@ like or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the purchase of the area , there is no allow@@ ance but is worth a real , in doubt of marketing , is the counter @-@ speech .
state request , proposed according to the proposed resolution , takes place three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two counter@@ tuning at the original program that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stefan H@@ aller , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; If we put the decision so , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it was last not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes on an increase in performance in the first official mandatory field of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .

walk in the resin of Stern to Stern
in the resin the nationwide first &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is to be created .
this is planning the association &apos;s observ@@ atory for Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many hard@@ est visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he establishes nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good achiev@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ comes from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be comple@@ mented by the internet .
that is why thousands of thousands of mobile @-@ networks play a role in the site of thousands of mobile choice .
also accessibility is a criterion .
later , the Star@@ Office &apos;s train should be enlarged by train .
&quot; on the star@@ pf@@ ad discover the viewers a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star much stronger than another , even though he could be far more distant .
I also im@@ par@@ ted to which constellation can be an selected star and when it is best to be seen .
the association has already been operating in the Mining District St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located observ@@ atory north of Germany .
the location in the heart of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany according to the Federal Reserve .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andromed@@ a galaxy are clearly visible .
in the university city , there has been something similar to the Planet@@ arium planet@@ arium since 2003 on the initiative of the planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen - the planetary path .
starting in front of the har@@ ness Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the still@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ defined plug @-@ in Plu@@ to at the final point - are precisely positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away from the sun at least 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the overall distance of the planetary closure is about four kilometers .
while the light takes up from sun to Plu@@ to , for about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour through to St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
ped@@ estri@@ ans therefore are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would still last a year .

when the pair held for photos noted Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect scale . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight , &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko vo@@ iced .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
climate questions asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pounds @-@ debut in this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after its lightweight title in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves later openly to fight with the network which offers the best financial package .

whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he gu@@ arding Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle .

four closures last after tire flo@@ zer
during an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were badly in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday after@@ no@@ ons .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the connection point market , probably after a tyre board , control over his car .
the passenger wel@@ ded to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he turned over and then lie on the roof of the green stri@@ pe .
the four races - two adults and two children - were seriously in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at service the A@@ 7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be run on the left lanes .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ g@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 for the closing time against Braunschweig , that expresses the optimization of def@@ ences in Au@@ e points .
with the first start of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites to much , and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses at Fortuna Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle is also to be optimized further .
and one gate after an exit , the For@@ tun@@ er will no longer want to catch anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts itself on line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better placed after the experience in preparation with the Tri@@ ang@@ ette , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ man Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is to be sure of his cause , &quot; because we just have in the thirty @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can still harmon@@ ise better and we don &apos;t afford as many play@@ grounds . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you decide to speak about a mis@@ guiding start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if we can focus on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak from a proper start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; starting in the season , I judge about six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ man Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be blin@@ ded pre@@ matur@@ ely because of an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e might be even something fres@@ her , since they would have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension into the bones .
&quot; but they do not know as 100 @-@ owned where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Defense of the Fortuna .
while the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy Favor@@ ite on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are taking them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is ble@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is very positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to hit from the outset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet such a statement would be arro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el wants to experience its players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age tests released
recent results of test for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 per cent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everybody believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( ECSC ) has started conducting the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more exact during the asylum process , following the Swedish migration authority ( migrant workers ) because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ation@@ shor@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has ma@@ iled to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed , that the person is &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently stable in recent months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a huge difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has lied over his age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 testing and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the inferior person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she asser@@ ted that in 243 of these cases the person had told the person that it was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , for the x @-@ rays of the Wis@@ dom and MR@@ V recordings are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty due to pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it sure we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the Form@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is in@@ correctly .
the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday there was a seven tonnes of emphasis on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach installed .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builders at the Department of stre@@ et@@ si and Transport in the Govern@@ ors Freiburg .
in April the works began at the same time at all three sandy g@@ dges made between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
bau@@ l@@ ending is planned for October and is sure that the timetable will be respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , runs through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges , too , it has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from rot@@ em Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
at the entrance of the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been preserved on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called cr@@ aps .
this is a random variation , which is also used as a farm .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian road is supposed to go away .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented Brü@@ ck@@ enk@@ amm .
particular finger@@ tips has that requires that leads of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fiber , connected to which many companies are connected .
residents were informed about the projects in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs need to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building building and the meeting point towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated via a traffic light .
for construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher Local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is locked .
the costs for the three fr@@ actions are 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest at German potato salad
it isn &apos;t so frequent that parties move on a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what otherwise it is difficult to bring to a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows in this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ del invites to &quot; big electoral pr@@ el@@ ude . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top of the presidential election on 24th September , and dep@@ uty leader of the Deputy Chairman of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already in place before the start of the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ gan@@ try , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ell - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful image that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come here together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ red potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ak easily , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
the police brought many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ; it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D actually arrived at Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes told by the Af@@ ak volcanoes , he tried to undertake such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a desc@@ endant , because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch was not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; overlooking the event on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pe@@ ar Af@@ ak @-@ Chair Uwe Junge .
in the room there are about 200 li@@ sten@@ ers that are waiting for the Presidential did@@ acy to the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty leader of the Beat@@ les of Stor@@ ch , will hold its speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ ak event , the guests on the ground have a longer breath , but also there is said just after 21 clock .
the police can de@@ generate - no special inci@@ dents .

both united the desire to cross not only the limits on their instrument but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new guise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; brings together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece of &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ a@@ str@@ ator N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix @-@ mix , jazz and the free playing at a fascinating overall artwork .
this core element of the program was first performed in Freiburg with ri@@ ves@@ ical success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I have once in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next to next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the B@@ ří@@ za was that of her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who was ultimately bitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this assured the br@@ ün@@ ff Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in any serious way in love that I have been kept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation there was Kri@@ sten to say that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
it has never been be@@ wil@@ dered or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially including suffered , they did according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school time when she &apos;d prefer to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has in@@ ju@@ red me .
when I was eleven the children , I would look like a book .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
well I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to love their love life : &quot; people expect you to get you in a certain manner and that upset me .
and perhaps some describe me as und@@ et@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify me before the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that it changes the party
. the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ think ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp was previously a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp gained West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic nom@@ inee Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mining in five countries and made a carbon store by his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party , which would rather than be working towards us in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies of history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice , only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without a guide and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide leader of the athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an independent withdrawal from Russia to a brain @-@ sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be back into the sport .
Russia L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik @-@ Chief D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he is determined to fight the intelligence .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were carved by gold and silver medals . &quot;
in spite of its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the world @-@ Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) on stat@@ ely sponsored by Russia had found .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e den Re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that she experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ e said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia won the criteria for re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics world championship , which will start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria than neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re@@ setting .
threats are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London following a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it drew the two uph@@ e@@ ed drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her discipline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ e to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

doubts about the UN Mission in Mali was not shown in the Le@@ yen : the bet was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral celebration the wr@@ aps were brought out of the cathedral .

the Queen was agreed with the decision of her man , it says furthermore in the message .

but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a secret made of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked the king .
in 2016 he went to retirement , and he also rel@@ ies the title of &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted to do , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker at the Danish kingdom house .
where the last resting @-@ thir@@ st of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .

he likes the country , for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ son , had met Mar@@ gre@@ ed@@ 1965 in London .
at the Thames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew to the people , Prinz Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 year old reign with the Dan@@ es had a heavy state .
in a auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &apos; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critici@@ zed .
my D@@ än@@ isch was vibr@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ den@@ ul@@ ls instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the her@@ edi@@ st had the reputation to be the brand @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for fores@@ ight .

Premier W@@ eil wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of the potential majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen
false @-@ speaking Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governance for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he does not want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising ex@@ iting of a Green @-@ MEPs from their country @-@ day group in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the election campaign , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce One @-@ vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ ini@@ ster established its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Desert ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U frac@@ tion@@ ef B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler would recommend to his faction to take it up .
so both CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new landmark on the 14th of January will be elected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state must now decide if it could continue in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil has however , however , is essential that the day @-@ day decides as quickly as its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday about her further action .
the provincial version also provides the possibility that the Land@@ tag of the Prime Minister expresses the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these possibilities must be legally cleaned , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all your questions in peace when they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy @-@ maker himself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it referred to as a trailer in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the cancellation dep@@ uty on the return of their country &apos;s day visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that she has received her country &apos;s visit , which she has received on the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; divided the country as meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group Leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ign@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there was no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Regi@@ stra@@ in@@ did@@ at Martin Schulz condemned the passage of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on @-@ Members of El@@ ke T@@ s on the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of the former Green @-@ MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal on the voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the president of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , to re @-@ elect the country &apos;s day .
the Austr@@ o @-@ West costs red @-@ green in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen costs the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy manager &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her ver@@ last van@@ ity and in her fr@@ acts their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that makes the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony and attempts to strike political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precip@@ itation CD@@ U @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ef B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to absorb El@@ ke T@@ s into the CD@@ U .

the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD &apos;s powerful force , SPD and Green had a high @-@ thin majority of one voice in the country .
agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Lord Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to closely follow the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer portal www.@@ se@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the Bundes@@ länder will present the latest information on the affected egg @-@ char@@ ters .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs are out of the offer - because the central role of the Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived by the Minister of Agriculture ?
food supervision is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately lifted up and finds itself since the announcement of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment can be retri@@ ev@@ able for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade has just as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold @-@ selling products are transpor@@ table and health un@@ think@@ able .
if you are over@@ loaded with eggs of the decl@@ ining content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not transpor@@ table .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time it is not the operations to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after a great knowledge , the manufacturing sector does not meet any immediate debt .
rather , they must count on the basis of poor illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a little check@@ ers at the harvest .
is it only missing on the personnel or also on the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the procedure .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be banned from 100 percent .
precisely this is why a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences may exist , of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already heard many times , that I expect a complete education about the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
the consumer and consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ capable food .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
the weigh@@ ted means are manufacturers , distributors and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
fundamentally must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of living animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it has to be consistent on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities , that the facts are quickly reconc@@ iled .
how to impact the financial rules of Football to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent unauthorized issues of the European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A yet , because the leading organization , which monitors the European game , has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which was launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G some point has to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 2@@ 62 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that is amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to France .
PS@@ G can be done with certainty the money , so N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ signed and bring it to a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich Herr@@ ing family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money to purchase players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate immigration sources , which enable them to the break @-@ up point in their way to the football business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election for the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had huge debt in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ed to ruin , when banks or owner with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential and then power@@ invested to build the team and build a global brand - to a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P pres@@ ump@@ tion period , which will run until 2018 , clubs may take losses at the amount of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 dropped by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , the UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cr@@ inge from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , towards The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year deal , so the deri@@ ves for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine tot@@ alling 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ see their financial visibility by connecting their income by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could be transp@@ onder the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship would exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate earnings .
exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of P@@ SA was made by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar through payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar could come .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have progres@@ sed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship becomes Ambassador and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators will be able to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to respect each attempt to handle the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s is a blessing for sponsorship of sponsorship and merchan@@ dis@@ ing .
the association assumes that sales after signing up at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly mist@@ aken to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent the N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s absorption by claimed that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial &quot; intelligence , &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to cat@@ ars of the latter own@@ ers@@ an to PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose organisation is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares reservations by La League against a state that is financed by a society .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the whole landscape of Football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play because you have different paths or have different interests when a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new shock supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord cho@@ col@@ ates has been produced for Swiss .
now , the s@@ alute is standing in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the job anew .
Swiss speaker at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ert confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A to an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; North @-@ speaking Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will shut up a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
about 17 million small white se@@ wed Sho@@ bs to 14 grams per year distribute the flight manager in front of the landing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to make Swiss any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate the volume of order in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a pressing job .
how many applicants are there with the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y them .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer has not been accessible for an opinion .
chocolate charts are distributed on board the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss col@@ ates producers .
for long @-@ hau@@ l trips , customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the business class sal@@ ary passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short route , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ year period ( as the den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ akers the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &apos; The State &quot; for M@@ TV twi@@ sted ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d to bigger things .
as a cultural ar@@ te@@ ar@@ act it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise it feels like the time was short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an initial history for a promising D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by moving on the core of the G@@ ags - actor middle ages , children , who will grow up - they still managed the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the Wit@@ ch .
&quot; ten years later , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotional @-@ rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the trav@@ eller , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ he years as &quot; The Hand of the Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sw@@ inging the cradle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point ruins a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some In@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ car@@ et@@ aker ) , now Roman@@ tics , has still not forgotten k@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is still another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ akers ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ tight impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual are the courses of the best part of the franchise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ lions under@@ side beard from &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old saus@@ age .
it is the moments of random del@@ ity that could attack this Franchise would like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist ... &quot; whose last scene will show the Ban@@ de how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now recalls another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ po@@ stage I@@ con@@ graph .
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main envel@@ op - a hard ges@@ ot@@ ted Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a more exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice gig to watch ( the police spends the time trying to watch chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ hal@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ fty Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who bears a re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often like a single .
with six long episodes , it moves away and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; that was reduced to a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p s@@ ati@@ re could better supply because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ oured a bunch of Hamburg .
the message for the imag@@ inary general audience is that Western culture can make everything for the fo@@ d@@ der for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on the Wednesday morning at the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ a@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart were group@@ ed numerous objects like the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 school@@ ing were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and was en@@ acted by the arrest warran@@ t in arrest warran@@ t .
in addition , the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ icious Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two are therefore probably shipped to Germany .
at the action were Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators involved .
over 300 police officers were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will be organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence perpet@@ rated by murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and s@@ press@@ ors .
already since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secution of Con@@ stance against the organised drug @-@ trade in the southern German area .
between the pro@@ secution of Con@@ stance in Con@@ stance and Palermo were a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ a@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the grand@@ use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the investigations , and above all the Italian citizenship , with respect to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen as early in the morning several shots were shot in a guest house , likely to go to the bank account of the bank .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not arise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report that the foreig@@ ner will be significant short@@ comings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum processes .
the Federal Commissioner for the Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Foundation , has provided a media report on large gaps in the Aus@@ länder@@ behörde register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ici@@ encies with the recorded data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to some serious failures decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people with foreign citizenship , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 export authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately kept , the data quality in parts has not been good .
in certain cases the data of 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually should not arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data entries can slow down reverse processes , &quot; it says the report to further .
in statistics on emig@@ rate people are over EU citizens who have not had to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false sub@@ orders have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have traveled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is from an internal paper issued by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is therefore , the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; for families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the New Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the entrance capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made the record for admission and accommodation for families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) consider these commitments for adequate .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten the lack of happiness in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a haz@@ ard of the child labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ously as our bodies are laid out for it and we respect the don@@ ors for stran@@ gers to make their blood for stran@@ gers , nor even sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ score Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold its interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation must have sub@@ du@@ ed over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they hold down the interest rates on family income in the midst of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for keeping interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , whereas in this month less members have an increase , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in her quarterly review report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.9 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and warned that the pressure on the budget will continue , whereby the inflation in the autumn is expected to rise in just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ aled that over the next few years Z@@ advertise would be necessary to grow the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may cost more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Con@@ tr@@ ons , which was issued a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds , more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds .
minutes after deciding on interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tendency of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predi@@ ct the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however the Bank stressed that enhancements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts made by the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % increased in May and 1.9 % .
it has retained its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the Po@@ unds fell to these messages compared to the dollar and the Euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ continued growth figures have sub@@ du@@ ed the rising expectations on a demonstration of tax and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth in the third quarter is expected to lie at 0.@@ 3 % , although it will recover easily after the bank at the end of the year .
the most recent In@@ fl@@ ation@@ report gave little enthusiasm for households , who are affected by an increasing inflation and a s@@ inner enclosure , since the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first ever worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages come to the end of their three @-@ year progn@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the f@@ aint of lower consumption , which will compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumption .
the decision comes after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the P@@ ines of the P@@ act .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
in front of the final verdi@@ ct of the bank on interest rates , the call was increased to a post @-@ sign cav@@ ity , since the inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ rated households , with three political decision @-@ makers demanded a rise on 0.5 % in July .
inflation was dropped in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them over the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the surplus value in relation to their goal of 2 % should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very weak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ acti@@ bro@@ kers said : &quot; given the shorter retreat of the s@@ wap rates the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders are looking strongly to shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ als run and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to compens@@ ate controversial HIV @-@ drug for 10,000 people
in September after a battle in front of the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access will get access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre @-@ prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual un@@ bi@@ ased proph@@ yla@@ xis of proph@@ yla@@ xis use by around 86 percent may now be delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed a verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , after which N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the chess club announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this was the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first ones who will allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 throughout England .
predic@@ tive proph@@ yla@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparation that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transmission for infectious diseases .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
to those who come to ask for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants will identify , which study the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a doctor , can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will signed up £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by being collected by clinical evidence as it is targeted on a large scale , which is implemented and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ hau@@ l the extensive and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV and over@@ hau@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of lasting progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted on needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September on , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must be that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP ministers have been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation through the government and over@@ due .
evidence showing how transforming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
it is important now that this study is being implemented as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to getting closer to the spreading of HIV in society . &quot;
life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not packs and sold their bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made a quote on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square kilometers the large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ ed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my requirement , &quot; says it .
for this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel station is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown together without having to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible by Er@@ fan , two rooms to place in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine a classic cup@@ board window by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
gest@@ ures gold van@@ ity , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make him last longer .
the mirror feels like a window into another room .
in the entrance , mir@@ r@@ ored units place for all the angles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable tables are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a guar@@ ant@@ or .
&quot; a little engineering art went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so that when you push the door , very easily slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne additional 16 m ² win , an extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the bottom surface and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not lose yourself into the electrical so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square meters of slightly default in something very astonishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar lying .
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an examination of one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Association Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their business should be divided .
Paul has ever wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of separation finds in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers met 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co Je@@ ans family founded je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in city centers , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Matthew Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban .
according to an agreement with its dec@@ eas@@ ed father , Col@@ in - Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis described - about two thirds of the company oil and Paul about one third .
the record suggests that Col@@ in property possesses the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the distri@@ butions proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it .
on last Friday we took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers also fight for control of the existing business - which Col@@ in , such as Paul claimed him to be excluded .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but casts too Paul from managing some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hoped to res@@ sing the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage wrote that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held by law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from late 1950 &apos;s years and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood song , opened in the Col@@ in the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in the year 2012 , hoped their property and their children to pass on to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; wrote them .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis Group companies , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark was paid to $ 10 million dollar and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and according to a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and her lawyers .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and to pull our sur@@ name by the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the judgment that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father did not know that Paul and I would finish in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new staff president is planning to limit the media @-@ abor@@ tion of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the head on a steady course .
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , at his first working day conven@@ ed at President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , he asked a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , which he wants to repair : poor information that got into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ its diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to en@@ umer@@ ating Tru@@ mp by monitoring its media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television ranges back decades - and now where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the cont@@ at Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February with Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media is a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ridic@@ ulous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps this camp@@ agn@@ ant know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions would have even more igni@@ tion .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets which has not sent Tru@@ mp .
if his employees have managed to keep away from it a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no one has to consistently avoid that Tru@@ mp Co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a part of the problem is that people in a White House that comp@@ ose themselves from competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp material that might promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of the consultants , the president for strategic reasons to bring about du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp is able to react on negative press cuts , especially those with the def@@ ective le@@ aks , and to find out from where these originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February , when someone j@@ umped a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty staff in K@@ atie &apos;s Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished because of lam@@ bs from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ voke it in the past .
Tru@@ mp was reading the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of Rein@@ a Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his consultants are still seeking influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Win@@ dy &apos;s mission very difficult .
masters selected crimin@@ als get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and have hoped .
the police in the whole of Europe sends this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the requested s@@ bre@@ aches are not known , according to nature , information from the population will have hoped and will pray .
Euro@@ pol will be reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; Advent Calendar from winter .
the experience had shown that many vol@@ ts to hide holiday destinations , called it from Euro@@ pol .
there are 21 post@@ cards listed for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online searched directories could not be arrested , at least eleven of them due to indications of publication on the website .
trav@@ eller negotiating a mo@@ at and return to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some decisive travellers on the war @-@ type , who negotiated one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to back a field in front of their men &apos;s residences .
the travelers have their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull sailing , which is called the &quot; million@@ th @-@ row . &quot;
they have brought with horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kic@@ ked off only in May , but had been stretched out from one of the Council to prevent caused by the Council in order to prevent its inc@@ isions .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense plants and expressed their cars by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
An@@ gry inhabitants have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they were cast stones on the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced through shame on implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my over@@ rides when the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a n@@ atives who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted only by another round .
the numbers have increased each time and even you have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one speaker at Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our evidence , it is very important that as many residents can report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling on 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court needs to examine when we will make our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ters is currently being renovated and will be open again on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience of the company mbH to 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also recei@@ pts from local tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the rising numbers of refugees that came into the county , the hotel building was offered to the manor together as a collection of accommodation , which was provided for controversy of controversy .
the city forest@@ ry the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of an development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted back then in the council .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ters Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious people interested in the house .
he should rightly maintain .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hof with manager in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary boo@@ sting in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Birken@@ hof has been building for a long time period in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clearly , with@@ ered extensive renovation work .
the so@@ ils have been turned out , blankets to the part of being built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
the rooms are fitted with large wal@@ k@@ able showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new window will be installed .
everything should be &apos; beautiful &apos; beautiful &apos; close &apos; , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are one of the facilities .
if one wants to position itself not at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner level , empha@@ sizes cas@@ hier .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would spread wide , explaining it .
both single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
discussions with whether Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to specify precisely .
just under a million euros , it counts .
also , the outside facilities are placed on front , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : us @-@ Special Edi@@ tors places Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp , he is appointed to have a special Grand Jury with a report by Robert Mu@@ eller following a report .
the Panel included the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the cause of familiar persons .
the paper character@@ izes the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified its investigation .
the channel CN@@ N reported , there are already first occur@@ ren@@ ces of the Gre@@ mi@@ um related to a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s el@@ eventh son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin in prolonged period of time in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s and Moscow @-@ fighting team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men should be standing in the election campaign as advisor of the Republi@@ can . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to it , Mu@@ eller also increased more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and commercial environment under the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special Tru@@ mp Tru@@ mp has moved to the center and seek the post@@ ures , whether the president in the course of the affair might be ham@@ per@@ ed by the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Y@@ y@@ ys is to consider this evidence of possible claims and to decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called Ank@@ hing chambers .
mostly they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversy cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s pro@@ secution , to charge people for the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the channel CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued to turn around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s Consultant and in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al election , Paul Man@@ rique during the conversation .
right @-@ wing talks on Thursday night on Thursday night , that the deadline show that Mu@@ eller did not shy himself in his work and that he should , if it should be necessary to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily be called that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the elevation of an indictment .
however , the sub@@ stitution of the atro@@ phy of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp .
in the middle of the new revelations , the President on Thursday morning a speech in West Virginia to illustrate the Russia Aff@@ aires as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion which he knows nothing of the unanim@@ ity of a Grand Jury .
but this also works usually in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is concerned with any action that accelerated the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; method . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI head James Com@@ ey has been told three times that would not be established against the President .
there is no reason to suppose that something changed because it was in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used when Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this re@@ vocation , pr@@ is@@ y had become loud against Tru@@ mp , he wanted to hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp have asked him for an attitude of the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the examination .
according to the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special wash@@ ers and his staff .
the sol@@ dering spec@@ ulation is made of whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike an independent special soci@@ alisation of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later returned President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be folded to the president of the President of the judiciary .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow to such a step but prevention .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators presented on Thursday legisl@@ ations , after which the special funds could not be dis@@ missed so easily .
Ant@@ arctic : gigantic ic@@ eberg driving in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tica has released a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the scar@@ cely size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Oce@@ anic Research on Wednesday .
the over a tri@@ lli@@ on tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss re@@ float now to the north and will probably take two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
it has a length of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the biggest ic@@ gi@@ ants who have registered researchers over the past three decades .
a danger to people does not come from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry of the ic@@ eberg , is unclear in research .
in total , however , there has been a series of uncommon break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact@@ sheet .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the f@@ ew@@ ed Kol@@ oss was so far part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it always grows further into the sea and breaks down regular .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
north of this swe@@ ep@@ y was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ om@@ iting a few years ago .
an entire Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is is there sm@@ ashed , &quot; AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some thing that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fi@@ is is in danger , because the front edges have never withdrawn as far as it currently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under voltage and could be dis@@ cer@@ ated if in a key position a piece is slow@@ down .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , because they float on the water and drives ice as much water as it deri@@ ves after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the swe@@ pt is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in low dimensions , the British research project writes about the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is for AW@@ I information with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest ch@@ el@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the open ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks down regular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural procedure and has no direct connection to climate change , the Eis@@ shield is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the second withdrawal from the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists may be disp@@ uted whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ Sch@@ is will now grow again or in the long term , and possibly merge together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if this researcher does not return to the quar@@ ry of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the past decades there are still very many ice @-@ mur@@ ders of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
this long finish of the Ant@@ arctic extends towards South America .
according to data of the British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the ice @-@ area of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has gone back around 28 000 square kilometres since the 195@@ 0s .
the decline in temperature have contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula have passed over 50 years by about three degrees warmer and en@@ umer@@ ated with it to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants bon@@ ding in the personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls you to step out of the Emplo@@ yers association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer brake , the K@@ rei@@ ch has acquired 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the circuits in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now some 17 appren@@ tices have their first working day after themselves .
the cur@@ riculum at the circle are obviously very popular .
some 6@@ 20 applications were to be found in vain places for those during this year .
nevertheless the circle is still lacking personnel in order to cope with the raised requirements and tasks .
at present , there are currently 50 not occupied areas at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U would now take up with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and the qualified Sh@@ ort@@ ages in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is planned to develop a concept for the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personnel recovery and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants , means it .
the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and out , concrete measures for cross @-@ beginners and involve an educational campaign , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities provide good officials and employees and offer attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is given by a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a high number of employees come from the service due to illness or age @-@ age .
therefore the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , Leader of the CD@@ U , is still going beyond a joint application .

peoples would like to be able to see all possibilities that enable an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the district management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - strive for a hard @-@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better the employees and officials than the collective bar@@ b@@ ation for the public service actually fores@@ een .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , enhancements or more money there are only if you switch to a higher stage that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .

Italy rein@@ forces the sound to become an NGO @-@ b@@ ail@@ li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs to use rescue operations for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they don &apos;t comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct it is difficult to see how they can continue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said interior ministers Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ niti@@ o &apos; warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organization &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; seized because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that ligh@@ tened illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has only been commissioned since one year ago , refused to express themselves to the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Pro@@ sec@@ ts Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of the human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , only after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , been surv@@ eyed since October .
it is assumed that his occupation takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board that can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler can be dri@@ fted away , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the ac@@ compli@@ ment of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew will susp@@ ect itself over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the life@@ jacket in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have above all have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have now been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules were considered unnecessary but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel @-@ bear@@ er organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said now that the number of migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came back in Italy in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and co @-@ operation with local citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali over action to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

console instead of tur@@ f - Bundesliga ge@@ aring for e @-@ sports
are the sports stars in the future before computer consoles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the state @-@ free ?
the fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gri@@ ps .
this also recognised the first German lig@@ ations , which increasingly engage in this area .
the beginning of the year 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and two pros provided for the computer game of FIFA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Executive Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain that there are still several associations on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next weekend the Football Association FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg are qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
also Robin Dut@@ y looks great potential in e @-@ sports .
the Ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen as well advis@@ es an agency for virtual foot@@ ball@@ ers .
&quot; the real football has to argue with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs are trying to conquer any possible markets , especially the Asian , .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under agreement one could be much more often present on these markets than once a year to send to the Federal Minister for Asia .
why is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on the competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport , have established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the Asi@@ ans up to 2022 , e @-@ sports is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a right sport ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is safe to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ seals has faced a long time with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport , because it is com@@ peti@@ tiveness and show many biological and physical reactions , which you can find in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , St@@ res@@ s@@ lab@@ s , hormonal changes .
also , it need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction skills .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult through online play and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sports .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ aktive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a fast @-@ rapid growth .
in 2016 , it has been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly about advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
in three years , sales should be at 130 million .
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
however , the e @-@ sports &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors .
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ Bas@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team of NGOs .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ stein Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports was introduced as a Sub@@ ject , &quot; F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ first @-@ tel@@ ev@@ ised associations are now under obligation to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison to Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia too fall , and the ancient times can be clari@@ fied , it is no longer sufficient .
it is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but the company will be ori@@ ent at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one cannot hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains the same as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy to push for su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind guitar and five years were suspended at local currency .
Car@@ ter was sentenced to death in June because of a neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free to appeal .
it had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy racing at a mental illness .
in red tro@@ users and a cream colored bl@@ ouse dressed , Car@@ ter da with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down stra@@ ined eyes than it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought about Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it ended his life to make her own better .
it has not taken any responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said , there be a &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whom they are un@@ fortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity or even their cl@@ es@@ men have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t beg@@ ged the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity , for his sisters , there is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she is &quot; sec@@ uted &quot; that she will never participate in the marriage of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to others to commit su@@ icide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy in 2014 was dead by a carbon dioxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention to itself , after Car@@ ter Text releases , revealing that she encouraged him to quit his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging around , springs from a building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know , there are many ways &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad , and &quot; All that you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was looking for by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that they should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Car@@ ter defended , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was condemned to her to her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ olos : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation is not ground@@ ed .
anything else was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ ono right away , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ ore and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see him , he made himself ver@@ ted to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after his first use as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one would have been able to run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could be so pointed to me as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth playful , debut and straight from the holiday dedicated to professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player leader , but he .
sugar can be found in the dear@@ est to those you want to keep much true that you want to keep in mood .
who was thus ex@@ cre@@ ed up , the heritage of Lah@@ m can be inv@@ aded , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be well used .
Kim@@ oto : &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday three @-@ year @-@ old , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
to the right behind , that is now his position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ ed me in this start@@ up as the one who can take the helm best in their hands .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ disp@@ uted tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fold @-@ out scar@@ cely ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus , at devil come out to the services of Asia @-@ travel ( fol@@ dable also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le therewith , not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ kot .
and all this all quite well .
Sü@@ le worked next to Kim@@ ber@@ y , Rud@@ y before the Ar@@ med Forces , both responded to the sovereign .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm is often hard , in addition , addi@@ cts sought to be successful in the game building a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y announced that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not that way as we have hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shift , tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to this Bayern @-@ World , even for the new@@ com@@ ers , one sees the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ me , after a few short @-@ legged statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of an interesting proposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with rh@@ einf@@ land @-@ pe@@ eling minister : economy l@@ bs Wis@@ sings pace
it also proved to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor Business Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Agriculture is joined to Volker Bar@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old prime minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association of Tri@@ ker companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes over the desires of the economy , all the Lem@@ mer has blocked all the rest . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the intersection of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top priority list of the country .
still in this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until the end of the building is supposed to stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West Bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trier , which is in the urgent need of the German market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to take the route from December 2020 in operation , says Prince speaker at Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this a guide@@ posts to rely on regional but internationally competitive enterprise .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) continues to be prompted by Wis@@ sing , while the wine is an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German Wine exports during ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ dom have an open ear for people who want to start up their own company lo@@ am the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier will see an additional incentive for young train@@ ee , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
is an award from 1000 Euro for the most important master of testing and 2500 Euros , if graduates do self @-@ employed within ten years of master education .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .

of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to adapt to business operations , have yet been occupied only 29 positions .
the Chamber of Commerce invites to award more orders to external offices .
in addition to calculations by the CD@@ U panel , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calculations of the accounting system , the country investment 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of national roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the bar@@ gaining of skilled workers in the region .

Audi is to change 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a bac@@ kl@@ ash campaign
one day prior to the announcement of Audi said BMW said that it would be available to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ president said the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it smar@@ ter options as a restriction &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies describe the company as a recall .
European Autom@@ obile Manufac@@ tur@@ ers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that apply diesel engines , apply as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ obil@@ es , systems for neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles to install exp@@ ired , also take into account which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be indi@@ cted to ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ old equipment that regul@@ ates emissions when a car was tested , but driving under normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees have been charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development .
the former manager , Zac@@ cha@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to trial in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German crimin@@ als after Volkswagen , to have a system installed in order to circum@@ vent the emission requirements in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury car manufacturer carries over propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen .

the lav@@ ender is due to the lack of dro@@ ught conditions and because of the diseases @-@ borne insects backward , which are scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has been in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small dial , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ite we@@ ars , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the black@@ out from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant towards drying .
the little town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
Fes@@ g@@ ild@@ hood is present on this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval .
dealers , Z@@ ündel , dealers , vag@@ ant or a country @-@ camp are to be experienced on these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce usually meet , in order to review their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ hal@@ a through organised crime , corrup@@ ted civil and ceas@@ eless drug cra@@ w@@ ling .
but on this day , in the shadow of its own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with pom@@ eg@@ ates , or let them leave at home .
safety experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
you ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abs are rich .
there are drugs mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ ary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of rest from violence , and while throughout the country the corp@@ ses are gathering , more and more journalists have entered his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under federal protection , and even now there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their publishers and their inspiration from Rio@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is felt deep , although his presence everywhere is present - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which indicates its middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the three @-@ thir@@ ties , carry t T @-@ shirts that have his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although 2010 was established a Son@@ o Bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the cases of journalists , this led to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of Mor@@ es , which are connected every year with drug @-@ trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed at court .
in Rio@@ do@@ ce they still consist of treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ related , and although the terrain is still more slo@@ ping .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little use at the discussion of security , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very fool@@ ish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know not the reason , we miss all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th Val@@ dez left the newspaper of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the ar@@ cher was driving in his car and damaged it in the proximity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans secre@@ tion last year and the delivery in the United States in January , Sin@@ hal@@ a was become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t indigenous areas of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ing groups struggle to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of dedicated , two @-@ story mouse clim@@ bers for drugs , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings had contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may be anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ members bought each copy of the edition , as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force them after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had released the same story to leave the country at its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived his friends and colleagues so long that he would always be there .
he was acting as an experienced Re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he sold with five colleagues to the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism , without encounter@@ ing the do@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time , the newspaper earned itself a reputation for the brave and honest reporting , and its revenues and advertising .
re@@ porter loved it to release hard @-@ out studies without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one otherwise dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Rio@@ do@@ ce they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &quot; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug stores in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is one way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task of falling as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many sco@@ oters ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rio@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the spa @-@ bird , who was like a harbour workers , the friend who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always walk to El Guay@@ abo , the bar in front of the office , and always sitting there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love of the routine its ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home @-@ and run@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ compliance .
trust His own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smells a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with J@@ avier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrup@@ ted government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce met to the security training , suddenly no mobil@@ es were allowed . days earlier was announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were examined protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were instru@@ cted by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who signed the governor himself as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the por@@ ters have gone into the mountain scenery where the Drug gangs would de facto become under control .
for the edition of this week Rio@@ do@@ ce has built on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was commanded , when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drugs and authorities .
a re@@ porter was made from public papers , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who ruled the Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the whole century every political level .
several mul@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors have been accused because of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this Local , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military attack .
only a few months before , the readers would have seen the colum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the best informative source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ur .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the staff have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ters Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and proj@@ ections saying , based on DNA testing that it is his own .
in the whole country journalists have become more sil@@ ently , by organizing in organised fe@@ asts &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ hal@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused Ram@@ i@@ rez , the authorities , journalists out and let them move , because they have said the truth .
she has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger in@@ ju@@ red her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , involved in government officials and a simultaneous society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter are not only killed by drug users , but also on the command of politicians and security guards , organised with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because they would like that you hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ ass have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer sc@@ stat@@ ur and head@@ phone lay in addition to their se@@ perate head .
some stores have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te im Northern State of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents of Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo according to the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
2010 was made up of the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly on the front page with a editorial article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes it hun@@ ted , as it was apparently mur@@ dered to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue the work , there is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ barra , the once Po@@ et wanted to be Po@@ et , gives to that the drug store him start@@ up .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Rio@@ do@@ ce began on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than once all their phones started .
a series of sho@@ wer@@ ies with rib@@ bed and security guards near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ ote .
the war continues , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
on the edge @-@ out edge , they have released the news on the site of Rio@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ils are nearby - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view of the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all they did not show it .
among the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Rio@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how you can also remember &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when J@@ avier was killed , the practitioner asked me to send it to the reporting on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to devi@@ ate its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ workers were so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his love @-@ red skin was of red@@ dish brown , and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quiet past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Resour@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained dinosau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best dinosau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preser@@ v@@ ative condition has researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he located on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met something that was out of the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to conc@@ eive more accurately .
that was discovered by him fossil was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years remember to expose the wild beast within 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) of heavy p@@ umping heads .
after all this hard work , the finished product is now ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it &apos;s going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa is the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , though it is covered with a arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably of meat @-@ containing dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ory , and used a shi@@ el@@ ding technology which is known as counter @-@ cre@@ mation , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have allowed to mix themselves better in his surroundings and so@@ ften his enemies , saying experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made head@@ lines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta distinctive after the museum techniques Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours in order to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the cont@@ ac@@ ulate , a widespread defence method in the animal world , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their bottom .
although the consistency are custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs from ample pressure through meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted that the evolution fav@@ oured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals who use the Con@@ ter@@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or pe@@ eling @-@ animals - are much smaller and hur@@ t@@ less than prey , which is sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong rob@@ ber@@ y behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r show how dangerous the dinosau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs is brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on hints about his life , including his fourth Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs when he died , went into a river and dri@@ fted into the sea , where it sank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South @-@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preser@@ v@@ ous skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal holds &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal still looks almost the same as in the early K@@ rei@@ &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you just want a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time , when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r were standing on two legs , the earth had gone through .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avi@@ est monsters .
the scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal Practi@@ tioners , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sink after death in the sea and was restored in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he located on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the surviving dinosau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips leading from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was s@@ war@@ med by the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater shade of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains are still b@@ ump@@ y Pan@@ zer@@ os along the dinosau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a prize in the lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it is .
hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y Pan@@ zer@@ os that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
his right front @-@ foot is lying on his side , his five fingers are upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in th@@ under@@ storm : mass am@@ ass@@ or@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday morning at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass am@@ ass@@ ar@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re long periods - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) were in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday morning at a mass am@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
according to the first information the police were at 17.00 pm between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm of almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , inter@@ locking .
above the exact number of publishers were first given no information .
it is light to moderate severe injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher .
a great deal of b@@ ail@@ out on b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the falling place .
the A@@ 8 was blocked in direction Munich .
in the course of the Munich a approximately ten kilometres made a long way back .
like a AZ Re@@ porter , it came also on the opposite train to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ ans .
the fire@@ men set out the characteristics of the vehicle @-@ gl@@ ers who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 pm there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
at the same time there was a collision between an auto @-@ spor@@ ter and a car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the in@@ genu@@ ity .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone experienced one time : nothing gets stopping in the train and sleeps .
or you go deeper into his work and just has an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
the Schaff@@ ner comes and w@@ akes a uns@@ an@@ ft , or takes the driving force in the middle of the workflow .
driving @-@ up control .
but times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently has the managed travel @-@ card control .
one is simply confirmed by phone , that one should be taken to his place and thus adds value to the ticket .
currently a trial runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valu@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use , however , some conditions must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already .
it also has to be purchased via the app , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of ticket sales .
and last , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one climb@@ s up in the train , calling its ticket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the test customers then appears a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the Train Contro@@ ll@@ ers get on their mobile devices a message that G@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y Y .
comes the train companion when driving the ticket control to square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already well @-@ made online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who can go back with no ticket control by our train companion , check in the DB Navigator simply yourself .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB Fern@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives track , knows that besides delays and missed out the ticket controls to the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances belong .
for many times you have , in any case , however , one of the passengers are not included all documents that you need to de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the personnel is missing or otherwise a document you have to proceed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence are endless discussions between draw and driving force , which leads to a bad mood in the section or large @-@ room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the creator at the end takes time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even a small number of test customers can use the new service .

&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist did to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 the Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
just one day after they arrived in New York City sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b @-@ apartment , they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the street &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it meant there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ o@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shipped at her tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ne &apos;s lively body that was spread across the street and stay there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
you put their phone off later in order to return to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were pictures of the police band and people , the shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Father , who contributed a sign with the title : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stand in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ ker dog .
in another video , she said , betra@@ yed another pol@@ ling is his gun and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can typically call . &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home next day .
after landing around 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ants , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ li@@ th@@ under and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times prior to this morning , &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; that which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
she needs to know and see it and be pulled up with it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experiences a clever racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep away from it . &quot;
the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that was at a camp@@ ground , as the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local office owners who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to take a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri Saint Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it all came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met his assistant at Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless instances of men , often by White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and res@@ ili@@ ence .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , whose voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism on To@@ ge@@ ra@@ kt .
his engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after browsing &apos;s ground@@ ing .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to focus upon Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader , but a community that come together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open survey of film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , as they fell in love and mar@@ ries their wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of the black swing women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , pregnant women in leadership positions have carried the movement a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women need to bear the main load of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really kept up between black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is based on that &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the front front , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game .
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on are long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the municipality and the police are still alive .
Fer@@ rell is at local currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ages of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the social policy of the area that it calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless , they complain about a voc@@ als and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south@@ wards of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation 2009 saw the population in advocates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; Pop@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is discussed the subject .
while having said one to the bit &apos; gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be genuine class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sts ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ alls ) or quite simply : &quot; magnitude ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advocates are building that a gallery will attract more customers into town , of which the other businesses benefit , fear the opponents , that the pedestrian prec@@ inct is ble@@ ed .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farm market hall stands in which 13 direct commerci@@ als are available .
with the commen@@ cement of the construction work there will be an end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and in addition to the Bed@@ a square with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling nearly weekly in the farmers market hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm , always very happy .
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct @-@ mark@@ ers in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; why shopping sp@@ al@@ ted in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
one sees how many counter transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper farmer &apos;s market , it is all the more important that us at least receive the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered are made fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is ob@@ ased reasonably priced .
as you can see , Lad@@ in stores will be located in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the renting houses are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops there are almost no more and what is still left , then will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall fits not together .
and the gallery does not fit in to Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where is the farm@@ houses during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come .
or does it create the gh@@ ost @-@ gallery before , to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will just not work .
and a shopping center that is empty also requires no one .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , it is thanks to the crazy number of events - how I find - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer any place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall was taken , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the area of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost invisible from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen Tu@@ we@@ y and Haar@@ le , which were sent to by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Secret analy@@ st was having a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after being made publicly backed up diplomatic reports on the site Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which was opened on the 2nd of August , a coming resem@@ b@@ lance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline was dedicated to her specialised competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ cript and pioneering discourse , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created through the algorithms of DNA that was extrac@@ ted from Mann@@ ing and made from the 30 portraits , such as someone with this gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , if something intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent part of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been already spoken since her pu@@ ber@@ ty about the identification as a woman , was sentenced in 2013 due to 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer sc@@ ams and theft .
through prison , its image was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white self @-@ white , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly seated on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ yp@@ al per@@ sever@@ ity is associated with which she was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger &apos;s Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist &apos;s portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette bl@@ unt and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ted the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazin .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in jail , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibit .
and she was not able to visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so that she took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became an un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which in the course of two years are inter@@ changeable letters .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili @-@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ cted Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images &quot; which would pre@@ fores@@ ee a future in which the president would convert Ch@@ aff &apos;s judgement and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to demand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for seven brutal years after seven brutal years in a military prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp results in a war against information from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ e@@ ably ways to st@@ ating the rigid gap , which he actually should fix .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things from a given reason happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery @-@ written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature below ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is equipped with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and GS and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ o@@ tide following the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring with me is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition is stored in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows cre@@ ing as she appears with a free @-@ prec@@ arious bra@@ ins in the hand from the in@@ discipline of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they finish your speech , then they have won &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greet from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ews , when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in a personal way - as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ras , which inter@@ acts like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their gene@@ tical cross @-@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind her liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a representative of the University of Oxford because of killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee from the University of Oxford that was looking for susp@@ ects just after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been em@@ bos@@ sed with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ dies ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant for murder due to their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the police authority from Chicago provides a common warning system , that the body was discovered on July 27th . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ amer received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still declared on the place of action for dead , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ch as a murder , while the police actively seeks the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ unch has been extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ans , the Vice President for University relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ws can now be evaluated in evaluated and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal thing examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates during this investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigations in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that Warsaw &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want that he asked himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building car@@ et@@ aker of the Grand @-@ Plaza , who had just received a mysterious tip that had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline , and the backdrop of the victim , and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible hom@@ eli@@ al incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada schedule in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ Vice President Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ Chair Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ Doping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ USA@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ Doping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ determination of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the site of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could be of concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list is stated that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities must be reported by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to be publicly acceptable in Russian sports by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
in regard to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation into , because our anti @-@ doping system has been plug@@ ged into error .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs and we will not admit , which is not there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos writes about those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ Doping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales representative R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ Doping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report uncondi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the doping @-@ Sk@@ and@@ as from the W@@ ada of the implementation of dop@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
but you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Doping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main road of the organisation in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Executive Vice President Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving in the right direction &quot; to be re@@ used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Re@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys are not working .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - che@@ ating .

&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for your business , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive from the Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees &apos;s engagement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that indicates which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low assurance results - so you can re@@ tire why .

as G@@ lin@@ t , convertible companies can send custom &quot; Powder Co@@ ils , confidential answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , which allows the employees to provide poor behavior .
and if the main contractor is involved , complaints should go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its staff is treated badly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences thanks to consumer boy@@ cott , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ tible for more than one year has used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a employee wanted to announce a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees .
now , as the company convertible , can have problems that were previously hidden by leaders , that were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or non @-@ user inter@@ ns , identified and addressed faster .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which guides the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment and li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and co @-@ commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of eth@@ ic violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to her right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry made online .
&quot; before using technology for the surveillance of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will take the consent of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
he secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture partner and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high walking and interesting projects only assignments .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worth it , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Linked@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ets when their portfolio companies are well running . businesses are running well if employees stand up and engaging .
when the Analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees to increase , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee involvement in the work of the workplace @-@ culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data are useless if the administrator of a firm has no action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if change is not fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow the employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed which has now passed through monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t reports , so that ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , it was marked by the quick@@ ness of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better binding of workers in a industry which is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose clients .
and if you lose customer then you will lose firm .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two day practices and make a long day for the brood
it is going to be at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tained on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ mming parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this un@@ estimated minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the sum@@ mer@@ gers are returning after three hours of exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mühle &quot; , said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already complete time @-@ packed schedule .
the compromise reached from the two days is more than one day when the brood postponed the beginning of the camp for almost a week after the last season and during the summer @-@ school for the first time , during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August 18 . 20 before the formal recording session for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the control of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if it add the busy routes to the player to add another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed them , they plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it really is magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , given the clear si@@ delines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that was already par@@ ked with a tor@@ ch , which will be an easy task .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a dre@@ amed that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room and then stand up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video material from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not worried that this is not too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false feed@@ backs to fac@@ si@@ r audi@@ tors by third parties and displaying their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible wr@@ apping messages and to send them to fac@@ si@@ r audi@@ tor who may display results of the fact chec@@ ker from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main points of interest for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe they have influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were floo@@ ded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will be supporting a plan to pun@@ ish social media networks , as they did not manage to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted posting such as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to finding , which stories of fac@@ si@@ po@@ unding parties are challenged , people want more context to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ ress for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his messages feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was shown in a squee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a gor@@ u@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney worked for 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is so nice to see the manuscript by someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;@@ sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac steering wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other News &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , who has been written by a double @-@ end in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his durability !
and the letters always cried to smoke ; because then it was a fire for light because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would also be .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with ancient papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest , I have been going to be a little over four months , &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives , and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ th@@ ed hy@@ ena @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle , and talked with coun@@ ties , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ ky and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access in 2006 as the last hei@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Tom met a decade later , the staff first began to care about the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ es said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English bel , cards that represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you might think that land@@ fli@@ ers would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let all go its course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to dip into the english story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est , who tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ner who hid the history of Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ bet@@ s represented in the 18th century , who filled his own fun@@ eral by stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite chil@@ ly to be over and over and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men prov@@ oked their debt crisis by putting rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes on the search for other unique writing experiences
he has had a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic novel about El@@ se@@ ab@@ mo@@ ki behind himself , the site of a sanitary facility from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle scre@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the sle@@ eve of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rund@@ schau by Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will hold for Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August it is supposed to be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the organis@@ ers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) do not really , write it on their yesterday released website .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are the firm conviction that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer will appreciate the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it &apos;s going to be more than just a logo and a slogan , it is called on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a single @-@ standing promise to form@@ ulate , one that gives the city a distinctive sole feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually she is present in competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount will be charged the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August cons@@ ults in Ankara of the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ing and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer considered in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
at the presidency of the Heads of State , the five Vice @-@ Chair shall now also participate as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were the civilians in the Y@@ as in the hiber@@ nation .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were de@@ posed .
since the squ@@ ander@@ ed Cou@@ p has led President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
about 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of the alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan as a dragon moving of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt , this week has been in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan at the uprising &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really under control of the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in late February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general stand , there are concerns due to an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifested itself among other things in the lifting of the head of a ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the Greater Self @-@ coach in the army and the security guards continues to pass at any rate .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan led by decre@@ e another 73@@ 95 state fires , including 2@@ 303 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
in doing so it seemed that Erdo@@ gan have en@@ forced the military .
the gener@@ als g@@ ills earlier than the actual men of the land .
three times they put on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election 2002 Erdo@@ gan hit the power of the military step by step back , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers , Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the coup attempt from fear of persecution in other countries asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets that , such development could not be cold .
in any case , in the alliance , there is doubt in the Alliance after the inf@@ ancy of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; non @-@ Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he looks ahead of lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill must be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the citizens of other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will address the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that our economies are good , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rolling distance for racing cars
over the past few months the future of the speed@@ way has been extended - now it should go very fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ row track , on which the tourist railway runs , will be built .
in order to secure the future of the speed@@ level for the long term , according to the German Ministry of Finance , scheduled to begin on the track next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and rolling the route &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Il@@ men@@ au @-@ race &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the country has become especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared traffic Secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the route is reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
this is the sum of 75 per cent .
the Treaty , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country , I shall definitely be voted .
the ministry and the south @-@ Thur@@ in@@ gia as the operator may already be agreed with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the roadmap , which these vehicles and the quality standards have negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for eleven years .
to make it possible to order the racing bus Shuttle in December 2017 .
the racing bus Shuttle is a popular train station located between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot plant that was tested in the course of a pilot plant , whether the circuit is used by enough many people to order it again in the future .
the track is also in part strongly b@@ end@@ able .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be crazy 2017 , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ered Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the oc@@ ular color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people worry about it , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key with the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen evol@@ ves from their infl@@ atable partners with a si@@ licon brick , which feels warm to feel warm - with conscious human responses , which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also customize its robots in accordance with his beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot to the type or color of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will still be worried , as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities who would look in a step@@ ford @-@ woman &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen develops to robots with a si@@ licon brick .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robots makes it for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they are appealing to such as rel@@ ap@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sp@@ aci@@ ousness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &apos; with an &apos; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she has her mo@@ ods - quite like real people !
it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most sp@@ icy female properties , the bac@@ kl@@ es on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : refu@@ te ) Far@@ rah , inf@@ est@@ ly one most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator then why can men then do not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the site .
however , this sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deep@@ ened in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course hold no sex robots , and while the FR@@ P noted its rising popularity , they remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture .
but what penet@@ rated out of the edge @-@ zones can be le@@ ak in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or offensive until they gave their permission to them .
there is yet a certain overcoming that these highly developed sex robots have appeared in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has em@@ bo@@ iled to have women sexually attacked .
the ab@@ hor@@ th aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the attached body and the spread eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders wish that they feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to her &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot shows no real women .
you can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away from your companion .
they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that hin@@ ders on independence or anything that could dis@@ rupt the imagination of total submission .
other words : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political sphere have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. elec@@ torate , also families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ham there were newspapers with advice on how to cop@@ ing with the horror of Tru@@ mp in the USA .
we are all alleged to have allowed us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less notice has been the power of tru@@ mp , families together .
I mention this , because my cous@@ in , a linear poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has visited this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with whom she fought for decades , suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side .
around the dining table that is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another connection that this can also bring significant risks .
the left was in@@ vigor@@ ated by Tru@@ mp , but the reduced effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ itt@@ y way that our kittens will not come across any longer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is a still @-@ term long @-@ time scenario , in which the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as the ep@@ it@@ ome of negative .
I find myself now from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the failure - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - which occur both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact a very mild crime .
if Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only must be spiritual to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel of Central Park , the biggest of the Car@@ ou@@ sel of the New York Park@@ way , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city when one does not need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are qu@@ ur@@ red and the animals rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ free music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming acquainted to offer lots of excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since here two two year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year old can go to it and have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was obliged to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could withdraw my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street is it the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping - this to make something over the counter .
this leads not only to a slow@@ ing of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also performs pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store exc@@ ru@@ de exc@@ using while I tired the experience made to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius from prison back to hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ rists , which he suffered in prison in his cell after a fall in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was sentenced to a first sk@@ it@@ ator due to murder after an appeal of the Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ors .
he sle@@ w Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by providing them several times by a door of toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pi@@ er@@ ius said he held his girlfriend for a closer intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year prison sentence from Pi@@ stor@@ y &apos;s appeal , by which they say it is too thoughtful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Tribunal said that she will raise the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ stor@@ ante runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if public prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold is a strange inf@@ user
as the last of the floral schools , the neighborhoods of Gi@@ ves from Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the other schools .
three of the Ent@@ l@@ ass@@ shy go into the gram@@ mar school , four to the real school .
Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol for the school dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes under direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eagle , who grows in the chicken , but then into freedom will be released .
to do this , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the Chi@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and allowed it to bro@@ ods it from his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken sound a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and escaped .
then the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sal of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , which bore a cylinder to the bet .
the eagle is for the integration , said Schul@@ tor Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young may be different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wished every quarters that he had been accepted in his new school .
there followed Dan@@ bo@@ ilers to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps at teaching tracks , and the par@@ ental representatives .
the cows @-@ time is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they are leaving their students for two years of teaching only very odd , because it had been a really great time .
finally , it is able to rely on the neighborhoods .
on completion , all students left a song of summer and holiday season .
and the children broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year eight br@@ aces are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained because of illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August a group of illeg@@ alities was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is running .
the State Department also reported b@@ tv that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for that purpose , considerable cash pen@@ alties .

software update for diesel vehicles : what the people currently need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do a diesel driver have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and in part 6 euros 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded from this .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE car Club Europe gives assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the binding update previously applies only to the vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the power station Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers receive updates about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a generous implementation in the coming months , but no exact date is called .
Daimler has informed to write every person concerned .
if any inspection may be due , it will be completed in their limits .
how long will the retro@@ fit take in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the law depends on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen and voluntary act the car manufacturers on the subject environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
tim@@ ers can now be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ cyclists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is waiting for waiting .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ educate , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now facing a massive prize of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared this .
but , in the regions , where vehicle tracks thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there are so far no losses loss for older diesel .
the ACE , with a sale yet to be seen .

we are making the city life worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ li@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues next year in R@@ ente .
the position is already written - but the appropriate applicants are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he taught in the press meeting .
he tells of diversi@@ fied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , mir@@ ac@@ t that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is currently looking for an architect or engineer at the end time .
it should be done - taking into consideration the regular notice period - still enough time for a quick look .
since Has@@ lach for the administrative community acts as a sub@@ contracting entity , the applicant has to indicate appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
would they no longer be filled with them , the citizens would need to travel to Offen@@ burg .
but the relevance to the city and to him is important , W@@ acker says that of a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authority and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have been collected to look back to the t@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city life worth living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is safe over the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ gh@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the precip@@ itation parking lot are around .
the Kin@@ sey bridge between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the amaz@@ on@@ ization is still the theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike with about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all wait great tasks for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
alter@@ cally , be there for a city @-@ master with great margin .
with Has@@ li@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ er , it could be quite flexible to react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants often praised by citizens and visitors often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is as an ensemble of monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , what rein@@ forces , &quot; if new builds are approved , empha@@ sizes the cra@@ ving Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the host , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) already for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor is long , desires W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really really identified and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the other design of the city .
who wants to bro@@ aden Roland W@@ acker should provide a completed study after informing the city of Has@@ lach a completed study as graduate engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction sites .
the municipal office is subject to high @-@ quality and grav@@ itation , construction planning , atro@@ cities , urban premises with buildings and city ten@@ derness as well as a sub@@ sist@@ ence authority including monument protection .
bicycle on the lines thrown : southern route locked
according to police the previously un@@ familiar perpetr@@ ators had thrown over the blue bicycle from the rail way ( B@@ 116 ) in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these have been so strongly damaged that the her@@ al@@ ising Gü@@ ter@@ ade had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male bodies and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene there were witnessed a ros@@ ary sco@@ oters and a bike riders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said O@@ FF @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators had brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the costs for rail traffic , you could also get to the perpetr@@ ators of the railway customers .
overall , be out of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said .
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be guided without disability .
almost ten person@@ ages were Friday afternoon , two of them consider correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ ies didn &apos;t fell off , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters of the upper lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study suggests exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed intestinal infections .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the U.S. in some 1.3 million and in the UK is causing stomach ul@@ ls and cor@@ es , recur@@ rent or blu@@ ff@@ ed diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while sufferers normally get out to avoid meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ kommen found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that Immun@@ ologie pat@@ ro@@ ls in the intest@@ ine to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in the body , do not penetrate into the body .
cells , which are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result from a inflammat@@ ory intestinal disease .
in experiments was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a link between a bacterial disease - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immun@@ o@@ cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less infl@@ amed intestinal tract , if the same system is also with people .
the post@@ doctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immun@@ o@@ cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mo@@ wers such cells had , but another group of the same brood , which was separate , that didn &apos;t had .
it assumed that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually living in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the D@@ är@@ ms of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial cells that were present in mice with the immune cells , but lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so they did not need a intestinal microphone and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and Immun@@ ologie &apos;s cells .
to understand how the bacteria exp@@ ended on the immune system , the researchers learned L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers dis@@ miss the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ically values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our Ga@@ stro @-@ In@@ test@@ inal Tra@@ vers .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i could develop the cells with people like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high trac@@ e@@ worthy values can lead to the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to a expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; genius , &quot; says Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday night his debut against Samp@@ it had .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the holding role , as people like Paul Sz@@ cz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after expos@@ ing .
MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia @-@ tour of the Blues and made only 45 minutes , which he gave to M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , an genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ am and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will be start@@ up XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent writes this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho met three more new promotions , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of his four priority obligation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. plane crash , has painted the sil@@ houette of a dream@@ ers in the sky .
the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle to the US State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a dream@@ ers was to be the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a endurance for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new Direc@@ tion for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind was turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD @-@ chief , S &amp; D prime minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no interference from the party central , only no counter@@ wind from the covenant - this is the most important desire of the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ House are monitoring with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not have been written in the approach at the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were ad@@ stro@@ kes .
and one by one after another .
the federal CD@@ U provides a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising frac@@ turing of a Green Group has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federation of Michael Kellner has called on the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ ge Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to withdraw its mandate .
the trans@@ forms to the CD@@ U is a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ wel@@ d must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the federal Parliament leader and electoral campaign of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD @-@ elec@@ tron , than on Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ero@@ e message reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , stands after crossing the Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ NA for the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland @-@ election in March .
a blue eye , more not , soothing the comrades at the time .
after the European elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then also - and everything was significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smooth .
aw@@ ful the comrades come back in the weeks after that .
then when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next deep @-@ end came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country reef , lost its Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his town .
and because he was pretty much wrong in the crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for its political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW exhau@@ st gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
Mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures have been added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps straight , therefore , in the past weeks tried to get stronger in the covenant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ z@@ ente &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efforts of the former mayor of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , there was no hidden comrades in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him because they spoke on a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , W@@ eil has basically no fault in the partial internal twen@@ ties , basically no fault .
and Schulz is not at all .
anyway , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
her wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the tr@@ ün@@ ge parliament@@ arians .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more democratic , like Mrs T@@ alle makes their own care@@ ers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Par@@ ines of the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs T@@ v@@ ests is not elected to a member of her person as a direct can@@ did@@ acy , but on the country list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on members continue .
the logical consequence would it be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; non @-@ maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people did Stephan W@@ eil as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD as a leading channel candidate to the Bundestag ) , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career outcome of a future CD@@ U MEPs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clear the backgrounds .
I will know if there has been more or more out@@ going the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for the Centre III
who wants to re@@ bel house in the years can get support from the country soon .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative stands on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the previous one .
since 1991 it has been in delicate san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg has still taken over two thirds of the total amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsidies were still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only tap into new construction areas .
on April 4 , you have given the information that you will receive the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which it would be 500 000 Euros of the country , the rest of the municipality received .
now what is a refur@@ bish@@ ment ?
you &apos;ll continue , examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned region might be interest in any interest .
if necessary , the territory could then move again and again .
the pier took place on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would object @-@ related , which means per property , performed .
the san@@ itation area then would eventually be defined as by@@ laws .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , it would only once again be the inventory , in the context of which the participants were able to fill a questionnaire to excer@@ pts involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional action will take place as possible , so that in the coming year may be started with the renov@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that any institution had to be carried out by the predicted forward @-@ investigations investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s why the urban planning may evaluate and decide when and to what extent .
there will then be a san@@ itation in the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again even after receiving a picture of the situation , she spoke .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why there will be questionn@@ aires who will be post to citizens over the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and ground arch , &quot; in which it goes to the constru@@ c@@ tual state and the remedi@@ ation views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on the size , distribution and residents of a living space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rainbow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only re@@ plen@@ ished when building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to consider , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .
new measures are not eligible for restructuring measures .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of the conveyor after the &quot; Wind@@ ju@@ g@@ zip &quot; - who first comes , gr@@ ind first .
there is no con@@ veying lines for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local Center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors also sets a micro@@ chip in order to get a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip , so that he will open his door@@ step to enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ on , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory approach at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out after medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ ated micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ on also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the promotional costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ al helicopter for an event fly out which raises the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the indications of the military , which have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and guiding officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter @-@ helicopter was issued next to a yacht made of Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter falls on the South La@@ wn One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty mart@@ ine@@ com@@ mander for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would require for the flight back .
the original flight was found during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records made available from the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act offers state @-@ issued , state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked whether it was a violation of H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds like if you are closed , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the official events have also political tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of health reform , which was ongoing in the Senate and he tested efforts to cur@@ v@@ ature of government regulations .
the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obligated to use it for the trip .
but its use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the Presidential plane was conducted against the background of his first combat airplane @-@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages devoted about the use of the presidential system by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn by putting the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tru@@ mp in early July was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the wh@@ ites house 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training requirements for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget@@ ary design@@ ations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ el@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defence for the 2017 , the DO@@ D Re@@ hand@@ set for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for inspection sets is extremely mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin study from 2015 , the shares ten@@ ets for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract financial statements .
at this time the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ill , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things which will be produced in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sp@@ ost . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut , are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I think that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course reasonable to be emphasized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he prayed his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and Ash@@ er with the media through his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his h@@ ast , the law was en@@ acted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp@@ ly as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming the US crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies which help Russians to build pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors are co @-@ funded by domestic companies that co @-@ finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea coast in cooperation with other European companies .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of oil concerts .

the seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of the drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; as a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 @-@ Company &quot; only with more state acts and violent actions .

back@@ wards : the town places 46 chefs
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch menu again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a cor@@ relation to the team .
in the urban children &apos;s workshops the clock will be turned back .
until September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban children meeting facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , acting director in the youth @-@ field youth aid , is that good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left will remain besides house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld region 46 children &apos;s sites , in 44 the children get a hot meal a hot meal .
last year @-@ year 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now not only children , the 45 week@@ days are taken care of , in the K@@ ita for lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support if children have to stay up to 2 p.m. CET . &quot;
46 divi@@ ding forces have heating service : they warm the angel@@ ic food , they supplement salad , raw materials and fruit , por@@ ters the meal individually , give the food individually , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
the size - there are two co@@ ach@@ ments as well as seventh facilities - decide over the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ cies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the we@@ ital@@ ist to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this also involves : healthy nutrition and bo@@ iling lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen strength of the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm , which it has turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ purpose and foreign exchange for the city as the economical plant , it is called the Press Office .
and that , though 46 divi@@ ding forces will be re@@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these lessons are not so strong for approximately 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an Democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , am@@ ber leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are given in the provinces in the provinces . three women were given candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be truly representative and credible when women are fully participating in and included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections to the Provin@@ cial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has released threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time the power will be peace@@ fully passed on by a democr@@ atically elected government .

GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to associate with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said , the company wrote about the future of investments at the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which sets aside other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties The Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union officials &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would learn as the first to change their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the firm of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM@@ B @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , our members deeply concerns .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Israel , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , among the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ xit , the rising costs of life and of chronic production reg@@ ression , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production manager at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
speaker at Tol@@ l@@ cross said : &quot; the Fili@@ pino at Tol@@ l@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter of GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union officials .
we had a regular meetings with staff and GM@@ B representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we engaged with the employees that we work like all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe business climate , our business will constantly check - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; over the last few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross @-@ site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognise the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as a production site and completely on it . should our operating flows be changed at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar warned ?
the page of La League likes to rep@@ ent their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not f@@ ade in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having released an offer of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel @-@ clause , but did she warned Barcelona three years before the World Congress ?
the sensational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the World Record around more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ cz@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned .
after the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most demanding professional ath@@ lete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages from more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way N@@ ey@@ mar has imposed its way forward , although a source near the Catal@@ ans anticip@@ ation insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every association , who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , whereby the Spanish Association start this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .

regarding the attacks in Regensburg , nobody is that it had to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; act , the pun@@ ished and in future must be prevented ; striking is the &quot; grade of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; said the author@@ ship in Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histor@@ i@@ ker@@ in and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit , the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of everyday life experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re happy to go to the Church and that is a con@@ serving fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a very normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , often also Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often att@@ ests .
completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take into protection Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; because all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he considers the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , presented by the Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s . &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : in summary , this means that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence have been applied .
especially in high an@@ tic@@ tion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be violent .
in contrast to many other alleg@@ ations , many victims falls victim to the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even positive memories along with it . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann , at the end of the final report , explains the final report to the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger his opinion is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ ct@@ ory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was more tangible to the Ö@@ f@@ teren if a domin@@ oes has not brought a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bio@@ grapher ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you look at the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took place at all .
it is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly be acqu@@ itted of every susp@@ ici@@ on of the medi@@ a@@ eval or co @-@ workers with the terrible cases sexual abuse .
even the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its sphere of action .
you can imagine it , too late or not take the first hint serious enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ inger , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents - as literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; sky &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as a &quot; warm , &quot; trusted &quot; , &quot; prof@@ icient &quot; and &quot; understandable , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who was cat@@ ered by the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always covered by types of children .
only a minority is compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ ti@@ sh@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to t@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
that he did not only put the table with chairs , and cast the bul@@ b and on the ground , but also ear@@ rings and all too che@@ ek@@ ed guys in hair or ears , he has already given himself a few years ago , deeply de@@ plor@@ es and apologi@@ zed for it .
to his honor , however , must be said that such education methods were widely used in the fra@@ gment time , the 1960s and 197@@ 0s , at parents like in teachers .
do you also know such re@@ bre@@ eder methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
also I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , are the detached Bag@@ at@@ ts .
this is how it asks itself if it is not related to his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just been cr@@ ashed with him .
in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him , still are eager .
but the truth is : the report det@@ ained Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
in connection with the report the report was reported much about the subject of misuse with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also available any distor@@ tion or r@@ acqu@@ ir@@ ation with regard to sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual handles have claimed to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a person acting substitute for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the true issue in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims should remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if she does not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students r@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers play a role with regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a de@@ frag@@ mentary student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he could have had done ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to have the respective perpetr@@ ators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to embrace that due to him ... Bu@@ b re@@ inv@@ aders or clear@@ er or even more likely to have opened as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ment@@ ers , trust , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance the students involved and / or their environment acqu@@ ires , could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore speaking from every room@@ mate .
thus it cannot be thrown for him not to prevent him or have brought him to an ad .
therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reading in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown in the report &quot; away .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and bl@@ ended into a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the midst of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
namely , it is clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
moreover , the report covers pre @-@ accidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ iefs of the cathedr@@ als .
the whole horrible test ped@@ ago@@ gy , the cases in which the l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ st teachers were inv@@ aded and ab@@ duc@@ ted , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states have to have .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the home @-@ scrat@@ ches school .
on that was how most of the witnesses emphasize , the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ inger school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there is not a meaningful violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims should be the general humanity of R. and therefore associate positive memories with it in many cases despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus at the most still remains the accus@@ ation to have taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which the state has been reported on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and was at a school , where he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible ( so the witness ) did nothing but then back to 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently goes the ears before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the post@@ graduate degree , which had even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out this point out that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent intru@@ sion .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity had existed , as the exam@@ iner was not allowed in Bavaria too .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was hard to estimate for him where the afflic@@ ted might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where really passed the permitted border had been crossed .
but one can not say , he always could have taken away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 , the test was officially completed in Bavaria even in Bavaria .
Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted yes , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards of this ped@@ ago@@ gical standards on the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we talk to historians , because of the &quot; pit@@ falls of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past , according to today &apos;s moral foundations .
since the inter@@ c@@ ession has already been correct .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ om@@ in@@ ely at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school and violence of non @-@ school@@ children , which goes far beyond that back then .
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally re@@ working .
but at the same time , I must take into protection Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ rings and pull in their hair and ears , were widely used in the 197@@ 0s .
as physical punishment is then prohibited , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Time has reproduced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the issue of testing was there also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann , well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI from his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats also played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t waste it by any means that he held a stri@@ c@@ ter reg@@ iment there .
but that has to be said once again : without this perfec@@ ti@@ ty , without which we call for unconditional discipline , it would probably barely have been possible to form a institution of world @-@ borne capital @-@ cats , true cultural ambass@@ ador of Europe and his musical tradition who went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1991 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes no big singers and stand at every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and over and over again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deeply gl@@ it@@ ful and cordial people , from which one could not imagine that he could possibly do something else .
I am regularly coming up with , like many former domains still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , regular contact with him to visit him , he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most domains are grateful to him today for enri@@ ches their lives and brought to them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a stri@@ c@@ ter father , certainly , that may be - but still a lovely respect person , to which she is still looking for and to honor them .
and please , once again , clearly : all that one thro@@ ws are educ@@ ating methods , which were then on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because it is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al s@@ inner be@@ x .
there is the nasty intention that behind it , only too apparent .
because the report that was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the mo@@ ist areas , a 93 @-@ year old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without those outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would have heard the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( who would finally be in peace .
