<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the lonesful reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when landcards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had already hit exciting because the car-Navi instead of a green meadow showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - yet very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of Munich's history area since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a makeshift that can be seen as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large map of over-card, towns and municipalities have been identified more detailed maps, so-called Urpositionsblätter op.</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bayerische Staatsmeasurable administration between 1810 and 1864 and originates from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War of Directors with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical capture of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops leashed with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801, the present neighbours were the idea of an area-covered Bavaria card created.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, set up the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessera" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Certificate of Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found all the other on the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is the most impressive one in the example of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subendendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was included 21 years after the map, i.e. 1877, as a Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, it is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Spring focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named in 1878 by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance: while gazing appears a small disadvantaged card with dozens lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots from the so called "" "" prides "" "" derived from the basic tax. "" "</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not occupy farmers today more - but a gardener of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of subendendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Schausquare of the October Revolution, was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the jungle leaflet you read in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street names "at the Gaststag" or from the hill "On the ventilation" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the auerfield roads you were able to once kill people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There were 1858 / 59 the Münchner Circle-Irrenanstalt founded in the Auer Lüder. "</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard (Gudder) headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought to the death of King Ludwigs II in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example the accusations of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he is forbidden to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haide, who is interested in an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first place, later was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 there is the Isar-AMPER-Clinic in Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">The former interior of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The medal awarded the buildings in 1920 and walked in a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, one set up the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural plagues to the origin of the Irrenpenum that had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bombenanburg.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as" "" "Head square" "" ", the department of the department was called" "" "Kaufinger alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a bagchapel from the Middle Ages were once celebrated at the Marienhof, where these days were the prentiation and take place on 5 April 2017 of spading for the second S-Bahn platform.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bourgeois group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Foundation for the promotion of colored colored has issued a warning for colour-colored people, which are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory board for the Federal State Missouri, which will come into force up to 28 August 2017, calls for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be guided through the state, as a series of dodworthy, racist-based preincidents appear at the last time throughout the country and be noted," said it is in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri which makes it people harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they are squeezed or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints with such a frequency which we have not heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organisation for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited as racist approach against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragmentary circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any longer during the journey and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent publication of the office of the general state-old from Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wheat.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Missouri" "," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready if they are chewing, or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri came to 100-hate in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the Hassle-breaking report of the FBI, which accesses the state with respect to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Society (ACLU) were issued for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration laws had to commit to conceal the local prosecution authorities, which will contribute to further lifestyles, according to the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warning are usually issued by the State Department for other countries but in recent times, stakeholders have the action to act as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Sorted project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher wheat-project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter white and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the rectangle of the Swidemann family, representatives of the fisherman CDU troops met by Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into his company, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and as well as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative path of alternative for the milk of his cows, so swidemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of holiday guests only regionales happens.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV-chairman of fishing bach, he said the Weidecaying project as "elementary project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage on such steep land.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area for a lot of work, much must be edited by the motorbike.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental business and restructured these without chemical-plant protection and fertilizers, even though it is not a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the turndown project and is happy with the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers must be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could still be pulled out quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and making thoughts about how they put their operation," said the Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often living in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 participants from eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The Preseration surface is around 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The overall cost of €71 500 was funded by the overall cost of 71 500 euro, a quarter carried the municipality of fishing.</seg>
<seg id="87">So they hides the farmer 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "declared Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The Landscoursesame (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasturns.</seg>
<seg id="92">The Goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence is the presence of one of the LPR marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the extant area may not be broken down (hangings over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weidecaying project 2018, currently the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots that would like to build just 16 kilometers of Zaun.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the statue of Liberty before</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is when they begin to push the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussone at the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic txt against Jim Acosta by CNN over the proposals of the President for the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat landowners and liberty-Imitators would have compensated him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid their significance on, and in particular the importance that you were added as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta caded: "I don't want to go down here to a full thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to, later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually right, but as he formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the scattering words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only have any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your effortless, your arms, / your afflicted masses, who are longing for, free to breathe, / the falling waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There has never been a time in which the "elding waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is in fact a conflict on the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who put themselves into place their words after their death on the basis - did very well that they have been performing a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republican by demonstrating the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classical image of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstractions - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she also gives himself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change from the right wing this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one, but rather an early neo-conservative, which the American flame goes into the reed world: "Lady Liberty is going forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is altogether and certainly a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus existed to see them as they had seen from the sublime, miserable, but hopeless people after long and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump are ever to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loaves members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminds on a while when only two banknotes had belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflow- who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eiliie Doyle was chosen from the crew to the team member.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Espanie is quite modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine feel, the Eiliie, of course, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver medal prize, which is represented at its fifth World Championship in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 scots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-track Muir leads on this path and has put up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another Scotsman, which one should be watching the victory in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the Manners" "" "captain Chapters said that they are" "" "great pride" "" "of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team but in some cases the medals and the finalists are also involved." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honor to know, but to know that my team-mate have voted for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the carrots who belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to ascend to Podies.</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put this home support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critically about Facebook: bwirt you not to wear a public office if you cannot wear the heap of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers smote him because of all, from the internal policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He embraces in the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and wordless we will be guided as the sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan who must work towards more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War Cried him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The cry from the governor, left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in managing its state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debate its haarless head after chemotherapy on his page.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the site of the Governor - the public domain is designated as officially and by collaborators paying by public taxes - needlessly and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson on the acts of the governor and argued that the blockage of the comments were nothing more than a mediation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolling or spammers or hwater filled people who vibrate on the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no comfort.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not proficient.</seg>
<seg id="184">The parish priest drew the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hasserted, but she asked for hate.</seg>

<seg id="190">It's a lot of cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that staff have been sent to collect newspapers with critical points, and to burn or to bear protesters and to silence.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Anniversary of the Bergkirche is invited to the ancient cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 4: 30 at a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made our friends and sponsors for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stressed: "it is a unique dörfful Kleinod."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg's premier certificate: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the driving church to tumults together with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the word according to the judgments on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the unveil church also a magnificent court, one belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, was beside the undervillage and the Oberdorf, which today is still visible in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Ancient cards from the time around the year 1600 converged these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patron saint was built out of the early Middle Ages in the Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord who built a church, worked with a pastor, continued to qualify for this church and could even swallow this church too.</seg>
<seg id="478">Related to this was the right to use a pastor or bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were there in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greys of the two are barked at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were introduced and the bells are stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops parted near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs, and they used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church received in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from horns.</seg>
<seg id="488">1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche broke off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the cherry and left you left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of the new year 1834 a storm the cherry tower and the half were rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent disaster, the tower was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present Turmcrow today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem was supported by the "Schaffhausen" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn, as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that is amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can be done with certainty the money, so Neymar undersigned and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich Herring family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money to purchase players, but have to counteract with legitimate immigration sources, which enable them to the break-up point in their way to the football business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election for the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had huge debt in their quest for success, effectively fraudulent and rised to ruin, when banks or owner withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential and then powerinvested to build the team and build a global brand - to a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP presumption period, which will run until 2018, clubs may take losses at the amount of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini 2015 dropped by the presidency in Ungnade, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to cringe from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the UEFA for FFP, towards The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the derives for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine totalling 60 million Euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to oversee their financial visibility by connecting their income by companies that are linked to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could be transponder the PSG if the value of sponsorship would exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate earnings.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of PSA was made by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar through payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar could come.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have progressed that Neymar World Championship becomes Ambassador and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators will be able to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to respect each attempt to handle the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG over Neymars transfer, sagging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a turnover of 542.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year will have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars is a blessing for sponsorship of sponsorship and merchandising.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing up at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent the Neymars absorption by claimed that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial "intelligence," with the club and the state, "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to catars of the latter ownersan to PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose organisation is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares reservations by La League against a state that is financed by a society.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artearact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" at Amazon now recalls another kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "Glow" with his East-against-West Ringpostage Icongraph.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who bears a reagan mask is involved - that it is often like a single.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resigned in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne did not packs and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made a quote on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square kilometers the large apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a snowed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne closet and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my requirement, "says it.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose they commissioned the Architecture and Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel station is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible by Erfan, two rooms to place in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic cupboard window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gestures gold vanity, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make him last longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In the entrance, mirrored units place for all the angles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable tables are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a guarantor.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering art went inside," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so that when you push the door, very easily slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne additional 16 m ² win, an extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the bottom surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not lose yourself into the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>

<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Association Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their business should be divided.</seg>

<seg id="1360">There, the Westco Jeans family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in city centers, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Matthew Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburban.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with its deceased father, Colin - Paul as the "main operator and the dominating personality" in the family De Lutis described - about two thirds of the company oil and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">The record suggests that Colin property possesses the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>

<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held by law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from late 1950's years and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood song, opened in the Colin the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of High School, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in the year 2012, hoped their property and their children to pass on to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of news media - hoping to keep the head on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of the White House, at his first working day convened at President Donald Trumps, he asked a major problem in President Donald Trumps, which he wants to repair: poor information that got into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>

<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House that compose themselves from competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the fondness of the consultants, the president for strategic reasons to bring about dubious information.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banished because of lambs from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoke it in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump was reading the article and started to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former staff of Reina Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the Trump."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of uncommon breakthroughs in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factsheet.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The fewed Koloss was so far part of Larsen-C-Schelfiis.</seg>

<seg id="1532">An entire Schelfiis is there smashed, "AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some thing that even the Larsen-C-Schelfiis is in danger, because the front edges have never withdrawn as far as it currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate is under voltage and could be discerated if in a key position a piece is slowdown.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Cham, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively jeopardised because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has been in spring much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet, in order to review their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the state of Sinhala through organised crime, corrupted civil and ceaseless drug crawling.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of its own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with pomegates, or let them leave at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a plate on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporter, names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abs are rich.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs muggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of rest from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are gathering, more and more journalists have entered his office in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under federal protection, and even now there was at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their publishers and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deep, although his presence everywhere is present - a large picture of Valdez, which indicates its middle-finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the three-thirties, carry t T-shirts that have his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">"" "" "" "although 2010 was established a Sono Bar" "" "to deal with the cases of journalists, this led to the Committee for the protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Mores, which are connected every year with drug-trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed at court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unrelated, and although the terrain is still more sloping.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little use at the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know not the reason, we miss all" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th Valdez left the newspaper of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archer was driving in his car and damaged it in the proximity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans secretion last year and the delivery in the United States in January, Sinhala was become one of the bloodiest indigenous areas of the country, since rivaling groups struggle to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of dedicated, two-story mouse climbers for drugs, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings had contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may be annoyed the children, suspected gangmembers bought each copy of the edition, as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez not to force them after confiscation of another newspaper, which had released the same story to leave the country at its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived his friends and colleagues so long that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was acting as an experienced Reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he sold with five colleagues to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism, without encountering the dodote problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned itself a reputation for the brave and honest reporting, and its revenues and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to release hard-out studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one otherwise dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the "International Press Freedom Award 'of the committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to go further," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug stores in Sinaloa" "" "is one way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take the task of falling as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in view of so many scooters... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the spa-bird, who was like a harbour workers, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always walk to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and always sitting there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love of the routine its ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home-and runways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-compliance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust His own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smells a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupted government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met to the security training, suddenly no mobiles were allowed. days earlier was announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were examined protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were instructed by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who signed the governor himself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the porters have gone into the mountain scenery where the Drug gangs would de facto become under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has built on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, focused on the hometown of Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was commanded, when it was time to write what everybody knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drugs and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter was made from public papers, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who ruled the Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which ruled almost the whole century every political level.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several muli-Governors have been accused because of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this Local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman passed a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, the readers would have seen the columne of Valdez as the best informative source about the abduction.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest against the Morde of journalists, because the staff have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporters Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and projections saying, based on DNA testing that it is his own.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become more silently, by organizing in organised feasts "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to raise international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinhala the day after the assassination of Valdez accused Ramirez, the authorities, journalists out and let them move, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger injured her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime, involved in government officials and a simultaneous society." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he located on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to conceive more accurately.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be unveiled.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it's going to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa is the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eaters, though it is covered with a armor and a changing tank, probably of meat-containing dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predatory, and used a shielding technology which is known as counter-cremation, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have allowed to mix themselves better in his surroundings and soften his enemies, saying experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs made headlines in May for the first time and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Borealopelta distinctive after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in order to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contaculate, a widespread defence method in the animal world, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the consistency are customary, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs from ample pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs was hunted that the evolution favoured the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals who use the Contershaded - think of deer, zebras, or peeling-animals - are much smaller and hurtless than prey, which is signalized that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong robbery behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs is brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on hints about his life, including his fourth Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, went into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on the back to the sea.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were pictures of the police band and people, the shouting, and from a man who claimed to be Father, who contributed a sign with the title: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>

<seg id="2039">After landing around 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and Protestants, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrel with her daughter, who carried a caulithunder and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which they had countless times prior to this morning, "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">She needs to know and see it and be pulled up with it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experiences a clever racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep away from it. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when she arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that was at a campground, as the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local office owners who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and halves to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed totally after the 9th August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri Saint Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it all came." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met his assistant at Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless instances of men, often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently said in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, whose voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism on Togerakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after browsing's grounding.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me how these people are represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was to focus upon Ferrells' experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah leader, but a community that come together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open survey of film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets show?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, as they fell in love and marries their wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of the black swing women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as swul.</seg>

<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan voted to notice that" "" "the movement really kept up between black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is based on that "this is no affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although it was at the front front, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson are long since disappeared, but the racist connections between the municipality and the police are still alive.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is at local currency for 2 ½ years because of the blockages of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Convertible for more than one year has used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if a employee wanted to announce a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company convertible, can have problems that were previously hidden by leaders, that were previously hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or non-user interns, identified and addressed faster.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney worked for 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and now is now for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshiman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 "Dead Men's Teeth and Other News', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb-pressure on the side of a letter, who has been written by a double-end in the 1700's years, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle, and talked with counties, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "whisky and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access in 2006 as the last heibin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be crazy 2017, a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritiered Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the ocular color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people worry about it, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey with the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen evolves from their inflatable partners with a silicon brick, which feels warm to feel warm - with conscious human responses, which can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize its robots in accordance with his beliefs "and select everything from the eye-colour of the robot to the type or color of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it will still be worried, as many robots possess the" "" "personalities who would look in a stepford-woman" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen develops to robots with a silicon brick.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robots makes it for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they are appealing to such as relapness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot with pre-programmed figures such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of spaciousness and "Wild Wendy 'with an' adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most spicy female properties, the backles on Frigid (is called here: refute) Farrah, infestly one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator then why can men then do not have Roxxxy?" it is said on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something dark and deepened in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course hold no sex robots, and while the FRP noted its rising popularity, they remain provisional on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what penetrated out of the edge-zones can be leak in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until they gave their permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is yet a certain overcoming that these highly developed sex robots have appeared in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has emboiled to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abhorth aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the attached body and the spread eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders wish that they feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to her "personalities," the robot shows no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away from your companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hinders on independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>

<seg id="2429">Less notice has been the power of trump, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this, because my cousin, a linear poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, who has visited this week in New York.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Around the dining table that is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in another connection that this can also bring significant risks.</seg>

<seg id="2436">However, there is a still-term long-time scenario, in which the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as the epitome of negative.</seg>

<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel of Central Park, the biggest of the Carousel of the New York Parkway, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city when one does not need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are quurred and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-free music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are becoming acquainted to offer lots of excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since here two two year old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year old can go to it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was obliged to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could withdraw my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street is it the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% tipping - this to make something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowing of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also performs pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no one is required.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammation)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study suggests exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflamed intestinal infections.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the U.S. in some 1.3 million and in the UK is causing stomach ulls and cores, recurrent or bluffed diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers normally get out to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereinkommen found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins contribute to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that Immunologie patrols in the intestine to make sure that harmful microbes, which hide in the body, do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of dissolving inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice, which carry out a certain bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the components of proteins to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a link between a bacterial disease - Lactobacillus - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immunocells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflamed intestinal tract, if the same system is also with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunocell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mowers such cells had, but another group of the same brood, which was separate, that didn't had.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference between the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därms of the mice were found DNA sequentially and there were six bacterial cells that were present in mice with the immune cells, but lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilous environment so they did not need a intestinal microphone and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and Immunologie's cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria expended on the immune system, the researchers learned L. reuteri in a fluid and then resulted in small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report to the abuse of abuse detainted Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen continues on for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the Rereform Movement "We are Church," explained after publication towards the German Press Agency, he speaks from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger could express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "however criticized that in reporting of violence in the domains" "" "twin measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, nobody is that it had to be "shameful and shameful deeds" act, the punished and in future must be prevented; striking is the "grade of medial manipulation," said the authorship in Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of everyday life experience and prepares public opinion that is normal for normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we're happy to go to the Church and that is a conserving fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a very normal pedagogical means" "", "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, often also Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often attests.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger, "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take into protection Georg Ratzinger," says Heshemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he considers the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen have been sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s. "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: in summary, this means that from Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in high antictionality the punishment for the students could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other allegations, many victims falls victim to the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories along with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, at the end of the final report, explains the final report to the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger his opinion is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleriker and perfectionist who was more tangible to the Öfteren if a dominoes has not brought a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you look at the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger took place at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will clearly be acquitted of every suspicion of the mediaeval or co-workers with the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the violence of violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can imagine it, too late or not take the first hint serious enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzinger, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents - as literally - "salvation," "sky" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes it as a "warm," trusted "," proficient "and" understandable, "as a very good-natured teacher, who was catered by the guys with cakes, biscuits and Bonbons and" always covered by types of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complained about its perfectishism and its high emotionality, which also led to tutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only put the table with chairs, and cast the bulb and on the ground, but also earrings and all too cheeked guys in hair or ears, he has already given himself a few years ago, deeply deplores and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor, however, must be said that such education methods were widely used in the fragment time, the 1960s and 1970s, at parents like in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such rebreeder methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, are the detached Bagatts.</seg>
<seg id="2926">This is how it asks itself if it is not related to his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just been crashed with him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him, still are eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report detained Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report the report was reported much about the subject of misuse with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also available any distortion or racquiration with regard to sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual handles have claimed to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk with my father or my mother," "" "said a person acting substitute for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the true issue in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims should remain silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If she does not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students ratzingers play a role with regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a defragmentary student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he could have had done (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to have the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to embrace that due to him... Bub reinvaders or clearer or even more likely to have opened as opposed to their parents, internatmenters, trust, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance the students involved and / or their environment acquires, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore speaking from every roommate.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be thrown for him not to prevent him or have brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "non-violence" "" "was reading in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown in the report "away.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and blended into a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is clean separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report covers pre-accidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chiefs of the cathedrals.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the lad of sadistist teachers were invaded and abducted, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the home-scratches school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was how most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme of "pre-school" taboo. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzinger school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is not a meaningful violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to conclusion that" "" "many victims should be the general humanity of R. and therefore associate positive memories with it in many cases despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus at the most still remains the accusation to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which the state has been reported on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish himself and was at a school, where he didn't want to hear and responsible (so the witness) did nothing but then back to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently goes the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the postgraduate degree, which had even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out this point out that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent intrusion.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity had existed, as the examiner was not allowed in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him where the afflicted might be exaggerated or dramatic and where really passed the permitted border had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he always could have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test was officially completed in Bavaria even in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted yes, it is unfair to apply today's standards of this pedagogical standards on the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we talk to historians, because of the "pitfalls of the Anachronism," thus the danger, past, according to today's moral foundations.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the intercession has already been correct.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse that was abominely at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school and violence of non-schoolchildren, which goes far beyond that back then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally reworking.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take into protection Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earrings and pull in their hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical punishment is then prohibited, he has also kept strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburger Time has reproduced Georg Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of testing was there also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann, well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI from his perspective, that the cathedral-cats also played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't waste it by any means that he held a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once again: without this perfectity, without which we call for unconditional discipline, it would probably barely have been possible to form a institution of world-borne capital-cats, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1991) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone one makes no big singers and stand at every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger and over and over again as wonderful, humorous, deeply glitful and cordial people, from which one could not imagine that he could possibly do something else.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am regularly coming up with, like many former domains still today, 23 years after his emerization, regular contact with him to visit him, he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domains are grateful to him today for enriches their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a stricter father, certainly, that may be - but still a lovely respect person, to which she is still looking for and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, clearly: all that one throws are educating methods, which were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because it is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinner bex.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty intention that behind it, only too apparent.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the moist areas, a 93-year old man who acquired great merits, and without those outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would have heard the Regensburger Domspatzen (who would finally be in peace.</seg>
