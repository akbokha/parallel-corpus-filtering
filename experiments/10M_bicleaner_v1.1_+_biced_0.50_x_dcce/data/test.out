Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put on drawers in drawers or en@@ vy of the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are rather snow@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is known as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
on the dear@@ est the act@@ ress spends her time at home , a TV with lo@@ vel@@ ed Dut@@ t and Mexican food , welcomes it in the magazine .
for the white furn@@ aces they bring the question according to the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; so the Hollywood star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother &apos;s Day - love is no children &apos;s play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a single @-@ trained mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger will receive the Sport@@ s@@ &apos; pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses reminded of their celebrations , they ch@@ asing in fast Gal@@ lop to home to the food .
a kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended the equ@@ estrian care@@ ers then again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament si@@ ege - back in the vicinity of horses .
he allowed himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he mu@@ st@@ ang not sometimes for photographers .
this was the first time in Aachen and therewith also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help sur@@ passed the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ s@@ pyramid .
in distin@@ ctions it lacks the sympathetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has started it already .
long is the 18th Award of the Sport@@ s@@ &apos; pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold American Mast@@ ers@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent are the athle@@ tics Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand of all Erhard .
many of these sports were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative society immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept a gap to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy compared : IT &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential applicants are at the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep this small in doubt and war@@ ns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to denoun@@ ce the economy to death and to death , he says .
he himself on the other hand would be quite different , claiming Tru@@ mp .
he will massi@@ vely drive regul@@ ators and it makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for both individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for it .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would be increased , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in that it must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton had almost no word .
the Democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure is classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ state Te@@ enc@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tru@@ mp , there could still be parti@@ san &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tru@@ mp is aiming to build coal @-@ power plants and return the coal mining in the US again .
oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate treaty wants to cancel it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is aiming to explicitly expand renewable energies with their investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ r trade agreement , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the US by international trade - but simply to protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans are to be paid better even for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
he wants to increase her to $ 15 per hour .
what tru@@ mp do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage , he says he cannot be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one side is Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics adhere to him , so that the budget deficit would make it even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who run alone , almost every day to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women are sitting .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arms .
he gu@@ essed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother ob@@ tains to the top @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kiss@@ ed the little .
the scene works normally .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and is dealing among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ dged .
they live in the Mün@@ chner North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs put up the establishment together with Pro Familia and Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s Aid .
recently she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a wax at the door .
&quot; it is not excessive to say : every woman who arrives here has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men flee for wars because they are per@@ sec@@ uted politically because they are torture or death , or because their families send them to a glimpse of hope to Europe . &quot;
in women , there are no other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example is calling for a bottle of water a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , mist@@ aken , told death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here also women in refugee authorities are often seen as a poor and worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the midst of Munich , who are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to having nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , talk openly about the experiences , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t want to help them , there are more accommodations just for them , requests B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the establishment of refugees .
on the question , whether they &apos;re using from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , please answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is something in accommodations of the governments .
even in spon@@ ges alone women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central fran@@ ken , there are in some common accommodations of floors or separate houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missing privacy or will make men and women together , it can become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continual violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women of this protective age can be felt , one can read at the And@@ y@@ earning when it comes to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since I talked about it , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance to strike : demands for new working @-@ work measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uty prof@@ essors have called for their union to use new working @-@ fighting measures with their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded his entire Council from beginning of September over @-@ struggle measures .
the J@@ DC said that it would have failed to respond to the concerns of the contract .
assistance and medical studies have been voted in July about the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was released on Thursday night on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had kept &quot; persist@@ ently &quot; to problems , which led to the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC &apos;s Executive Board voted to reject the proposed new treaty and calls up official res@@ ett@@ lement to all the needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board approved a formal application to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to escal@@ ate a lead program escal@@ ating working measures , beginning of September .
the disputes led to that assistance in this year sixty disputes , the first total falls in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the B@@ MA assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that were recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions that were still taken before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 Assi@@ stance and Medi@@ cal@@ end@@ ents , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty for physicians in England would be equally introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external parties &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands a official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ pl@@ ated hall of St. Petersburg , I cannot give me the expression that Ankara wants to put this reconciliation in most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile acting nar@@ ro@@ ig and it was barely heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan on the other hand said repeatedly from his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report full of five times .
I could no longer count .
he also argued that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but can even improve .
the next day he described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so heard would never be anything bad .
my enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin du@@ red , sustainable cool@@ ed showed that Russia &apos;s head of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the down@@ cast of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time has been w@@ alled .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia in his back .
the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will re@@ construct again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long the nation@@ ally controlled media brought a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed that the Turks would carry for everything the blame .
on the most serious accus@@ ations of senior officials , Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benef@@ ited from the illegal oil @-@ trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message op@@ ted that it is time to look forward .
after all , this meeting was held only because Putin from the President Erdo@@ gan received the excuse which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is obvious .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all friends who he can get after the last month was at a written coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit hard Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are taken up again .
you count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state @-@ based on fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agriculture imports to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West because it &apos;s reaction to the tried and tested power of power as a weak answer .
to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll comes with the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the en@@ pi@@ ke to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west .
in Ankara won the Russian state by paying a bonus that he called for the coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at support for the elected government bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow and it is a matter of course that itself has a deeper fear of reg@@ iment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit meeting in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace by the sea made it possible to represent Russia and Turkey , one , as it seemed to me an an@@ alysts , &quot; alliance of external sides &quot; : two countries , which exp@@ elled from the West and are poorly treated and are now built .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
the biggest differentiation is Syria , where Moscow has recently given itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support antagon@@ istic sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talk both presidents on the press conference said they didn &apos;t even attack the issue .
the President of Turkey has seen it inten@@ tionally to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of an open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than the NATO member of Turkey , it is certainly better that the two heads of state are at least again talk to each other .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the board of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan distributed the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced himself when she had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , trademarks &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands .
it supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales every RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock@@ bro@@ ods are to be changed .
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller labels for the private customer business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visit to our customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but will pursue local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these marks .
R@@ BS has already told that it will no longer run his six Nations sponsorship contract and that it will increase the percep@@ tive ability of the various brands in his sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the leader .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think I will see many changes .
we can restore these marks again , therefore I think that the time has come .

the three @-@ year winner D@@ ett@@ ori was awarded to G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , who said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it is done at New@@ market because I am here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ation when he caught the victory on Pre@@ t@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the re@@ tired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recur@@ ring career .
L@@ ester pigment , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger at 4.@@ 4@@ 93 care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he reached this milestone only a few years ago .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambass@@ ador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 profits if he would not only be a weekend and big tournament @-@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has inspired nearly 30 years of winner in GB , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race but in addition it is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount

it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of grand tur@@ ni@@ vings , including his famous &quot; glorious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulties , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ duce its branches and to return to his stock .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said earlier that he wants to continue on competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feudal staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian president Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly its staff reef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged a statement of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a substitute since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated at the renowned State Department of Moscow for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol and the administrative manager of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of affairs with regard to legislative measures and inspections to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked for his post to leave and V@@ ain@@ o recommended as its successor .
convincing the most ridic@@ ulous faces ?
this step has turned Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works as he stands for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the staff should return on their own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the official statement - that a man who was once called a potential President once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Kre@@ m@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister of Minister and Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Council K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FS@@ B ) , who created the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named in his dep@@ uty leader .
when Putin spoke to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be President of Russia for Putin &apos;s second term as a third term Putin would violate the constitution .
but this post was taken from another , closest ally to Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .

Queens@@ boro Cros@@ sing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is supposed to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the nor@@ deck of the Queens@@ boro Cros@@ sing with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four jack@@ ets of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wr@@ inkl@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who approach the completion to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fixing section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 m@@ illing rop@@ es .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is supposed to be completed by May 2017 .
economics K@@ eit@@ h Brown rest@@ ruc@@ tured the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the building of the que@@ ent Cros@@ sing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel , which alone is used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity , which require extremely precise tolerances for fit the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge load on their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a bet@@ ong@@ ated for the deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Constru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first zi@@ pper represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project the supply of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ and cutting @-@ cutting is .
after the installation of the last road period and its connection with the northern passage of the North American deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the North or the country side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 222 metres long is , about 6,000 tons , and at a slope of about 3 % had to be pulled upwards .
delicate , as the tolerances on which the team works , tiny -- on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; happiness in life &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness in the life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were cast by their fishing boat from the fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ guard broke out on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in security while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat near himself and set the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the ambul@@ ance station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing up the boat from their range until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was aged over 60 at the age of 60 and on a wall without life@@ jacket has been found .
they were all at the board of the Beach boat and were brought back to the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station .
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have un@@ har@@ med and still be alive .
the boot engine had an emergency con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , however , that proceeds from the person when the boat was controlled by the person who controlled the boat .
someone has wondered today about these men .

who builds to become the Braunschweig apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green mean : investors should be taken on duty in the future much more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig is losing nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acting concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet disputes is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a provision is missing .
SPD &apos;s presidents of Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; we are with the Gre@@ ens agree : who wants to build on urban areas in future must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
however , cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big force point in the Town Hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does one go with investors to build on private spaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing program , which will cost millions and needs to be financed , is intended to ensure incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few requirements as possible .
the left is not requ@@ esting har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of this , viol@@ a , eas@@ ed a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market .
when the concept of action is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the program is not yet entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built in any case .
but how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will continue in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments up to 2020 .
to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
moreover , it would have to be expected to take apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the Western city .
on one fell s@@ woo@@ p , the problem can solve .
because in the West city the dates are running out for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the West@@ stadt is again dramatically increased , one is removed from the aim of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling .
there will be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens should expect that there will be even movement in discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sh@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be connected to the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the property has concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck , which pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that teenage children and child are no longer going out for playing outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors on screens , was lam@@ ents in the last decade of many lam@@ ents .
at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to course on the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were based on the characters , first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later emerged from it a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena in the population , the interest in front of the play of the game declined in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the server over@@ load .
in less days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphones and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tr@@ acked with a GPS as soon as they were found once , &quot; photographed ( over a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang out for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States the game led to a considerable rise in steps which sets the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , which re@@ per@@ sec@@ uted 3@@ 5.000 users , told that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of trac@@ ed people coming every day , 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who of which Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day actively , because many public messages are boring to health and get rid of people who look like this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be over@@ rated .
who drives regularly sports reduces his chances of dise@@ ased in cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
therefore , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also dre@@ aming game @-@ sh@@ utter , which must always be compl@@ aining about something .
and yes , someone could walk around a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps as Fit@@ bit could re@@ trace our activity before , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist will be united in the real world and helping many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the ch@@ ament@@ ary
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American gymn@@ ast born on Thursday for multi @-@ fight title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
its overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal at Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone The Americans is running on the pig @-@ beam during the single @-@ level of women in the art tur@@ f during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American @-@ American , who gains a multi @-@ fight title and overall the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fies their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was found at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ a , the last three years have dominated their sport species - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ans from 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
there was a final exam in Brazil , a competition which not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ acing after they have won gold and silver in individual war@@ dness of women in the art tur@@ f at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won
Bil@@ it took the first medal at Tuesday , while she was reti@@ ring at the retirement party of the retirement man@@ ag@@ co@@ ordin@@ ator of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a swe@@ ar sign .
although keeping it insi@@ sted during their long journey to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
some of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flu@@ kes in the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost a multi @-@ fight contest , a si@@ eve series , which will last as long as it desires .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two rot@@ ations , the picture distor@@ ted .
Sweden and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es the world title - lou@@ der .
then fet@@ ched with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 at the end of the pig - and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished her as her grand@@ stand - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they used once in their log@@ book .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team captain had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise they threw to the audience Kus@@ sh@@ hol@@ dings , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that seemed sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
what is concerned , so that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass murder in the music @-@ listening in the car
according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot from Phoenix in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix for a decade while they were enter@@ tained in the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked at a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he rose on the road @-@ side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police spread that the triple murder did not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory beast , since the Att@@ acker does not have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 participating in the possession of one of the adult victims .
the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ om@@ ers were investig@@ ating the investig@@ ators , a closer look at it , whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic housing were killed in nine months in nine attacks seven people and two others have been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to outline the evidence that they led to the conclusion that attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , has been hospit@@ alized because of her injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ ah died still on site .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen music .
the authorities also published a police report on the s@@ laugh@@ ing that came upon an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found qu@@ ir@@ ch@@ sle@@ eves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ halia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ halia , the result of a genetic disorder that knew his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I didn &apos;t manage it .
I don &apos;t win this .
I did not let myself down .
what is not right at all -- of course , one has left behind it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund could never be recognized under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ush up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the scrip@@ ting language that Ed@@ mund gave me something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring this text to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical text language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ halia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t been asking for a progn@@ osis for a long time because I do not expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damages caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared that national authorities stand in constant contact with local authorities and who are already travelling through to the communities involved .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ atory of the Govern@@ ors , shared that the requests for high water trucks , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a thousand thousand sand@@ bags would have requested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a flood warning system is used across wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service was sil@@ able that in this area could not drop an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
in the South of Al@@ ab@@ ama , on Friday a flute @-@ breakfast system was used while in the area of Mobile continued .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are located both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely be reached via the weekend record level .
the met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the pre @-@ location near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a current down@@ ward prev@@ ails into Ascension is a danger , as these streams will be flowing only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still sli@@ pped over people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .

he said that there was another sti@@ but@@ son who lives nearby , warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have awakened and the water was stra@@ in@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a flood of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabled , and he that would be one who can swim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a great military truck and brought them to the next fire @-@ wake in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated by Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods had rapidly spread out , since there were still severe rain falls and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches Regen .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably filled by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and educational loss in five bor@@ der@@ land .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a con@@ stit@@ ching in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were both floo@@ ded .
the ruler of the community Rob@@ by Mill@@ er said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven P@@ ets which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , they were set up to host their evacu@@ ated towns .
&quot; once the water starts to pass , they will be back again into their homes , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , nearly two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants of the inhabitants who are hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last big floods we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to become a similar incident .
in H@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the golf coast .
according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday they were not reported until now .

I cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy divided the transmitter with that he is expected to recover .
he would have the first class to start into a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at Ger@@ mant@@ own .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical state ; the other two sacrifices are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was found on the front @-@ seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and police find themselves whether one of the last men of the perpetr@@ ators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ sle@@ eves for Stur@@ m@@ ri@@ ans , which were trac@@ ed to a variety of assault ri@@ dden , are v@@ ested the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a permanent battle for this .
on the road , on both sides of walking , they found themselves sle@@ eves .
thus , it seems to have given several armed fighters here who were very active involved , &quot; distributed police @-@ skin Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
it came to no arrest and police are presently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year girl had hit the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ icious one .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ i and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself among the women &apos;s Olympic Games and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been during every summer season since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din ist and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics is every proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female gymn@@ ast an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games - Gab@@ i Douglas a surprising Olympic Games and America che@@ ered .
now , the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as they predicted , but the most prominent g@@ ym@@ as@@ tics supplied .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , which won an individual multi @-@ fight event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but do not see turn@@ classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ i and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ ended Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad is only four gymn@@ asts in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that gymn@@ ast a cost@@ lier Sport is and gymn@@ ast first and foremost in private trainers who will be maintained by parents who will pay for the training , interior , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) . the list can be continued as desired .
the majority of this turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these associations , the tur@@ ner received its entire training and that is for families a long @-@ term and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ fs .
we must be inspired to the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a high @-@ performance and easier access turn@@ cre@@ ment .
I was founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
at my events we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) offered national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olymp@@ ic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , which thousands of young girls bring to interest for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that is great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ i and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team gold language and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .

this happened that of a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hunt had made last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt needs to act now , lift the penetration and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , so we have made the atten@@ tions show that they are ready to perform further labour @-@ struggle measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates before , as ambul@@ ances and specialized doctors were included to provide doctors on the strike post@@ ure coverage .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by an acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants to have a better vo@@ icing re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 5@@ 4,000 workers who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employee , urged the assistance personnel to terminate the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working actions do not achieve anything but little , but even loads over @-@ charged teams and service providers , and prepare the patients , nursing care and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to me of the Assi@@ stance of Assi@@ stance and with the Health Ministry , as well as other mini@@ stries , we have a positive impact on the concerns with regard to tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ livel@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses for those who were from a vocational training , educational , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , advanced training and the sexual Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ur can flour@@ ish in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to a government report because of the corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ um has led to that widespread election was unknow@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former board member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es takes the police , electoral monitoring and the Rath@@ geber to have ignored evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excess abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect of eth@@ never and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and Communist government , who now is a antagon@@ isms , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives as bad would be that it should be permitted by the police , lock@@ out dis@@ closures outside of voting tools to be en@@ forced dis@@ car@@ ded .
he recommends that voters should take a cre@@ denti@@ al with him in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a voters must merely name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to the finger of a person when they dis@@ agree to their choice to prevent someone twice sel@@ ects .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ought to preserve more protection , Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non official comm@@ ent@@ aries or work groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against election but should also protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the acting Mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be included in corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the niche , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to racial or Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ven@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which a person cho@@ oses one another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent mail - when older members of the Muslim community have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guidance of point out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ an@@ tic or Lebanese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions would not know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; percep@@ tions of eth@@ never and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition , that political activ@@ ist imag@@ ery will be processed to &quot; re@@ ap &quot; voting . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration spec@@ tions to prevent that the constitu@@ ent directory is used for mig@@ rat@@ ory and social advoc@@ acy purposes .
options consider voters prior to the election according to your ID .
if not removable inks take on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice to prevent someone twice sel@@ ects .
systematic verification on the nationality of a person to carry out to ensure that voting is optional .
a three @-@ year limit on requests for an automatic mailbox .
ban the political activ@@ ist full envelope and covers of mail @-@ elections .
the police will give the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations .
a change in legislation which facilitates an indictment on account of intim@@ id@@ ation according to the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Represent@@ atives 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
the request that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees tend to enforce that voters go alone into the election .
Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and it is &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets no case has been exposed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ ged Rah@@ man and his dep@@ u@@ ties according to the corrupt and illegal practices un@@ avoidable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been guilty because of a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements of criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ised the in@@ effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the election of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying spread of election and denial of some authorities is threatening this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ gers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are advised this week on the French cycling teacher Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot beyond edge and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ lon@@ er in the her@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only way to fight gold batt@@ ling Ath@@ let , which has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not to give the social media faith .
hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous facets that are fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympics , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Horn@@ í &apos;s famous .
the hunters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in Ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger@@ in on the cycling track , many people in the Internet point out like a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a tower on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to that he already gets to hear since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any major simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; distributed Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I will feel it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly appear to be the focal point : the emerging simil@@ arity between the British neigh@@ bor Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is said to go through a double @-@ course for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a speed higher : this user is that Nathan the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor is
a further prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy that others are also like the similarities
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in stated its satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter Schauspiel@@ haus Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face and eyes .
another popular compar@@ isons Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her sm@@ iles , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the criticism of Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard to put forward a lot of speech .
Twitter users did not return as they heard how uns@@ ett@@ ler Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; WOW , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and makes all of us look like r@@ amp@@ ires . # ange@@ ours .
short time later apologi@@ zed Scott Rus@@ sel who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming @-@ performance . &quot;
it was a miserable chosen formulation , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 people who responded to the Bem@@ er@@ kt via Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ an@@ ol@@ ut Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and filed his school@@ ing at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments by Mac@@ Donald
the network exc@@ used quickly and gave a message .
we deeply regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it will be broadcast .
yesterday evening we quickly apologi@@ ze to our viewers on the show and our followers in social media .
to clarify one thing , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments relates to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
however , they were inadequate and a miserable chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he has said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ olog@@ ised in the mission and tried to justify its remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ olog@@ ise me for the comment I did after the woman &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ h in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ian , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I referred to the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in pri@@ ori@@ an ou@@ tra@@ geous woman who tried in the middle of the shop without under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where they should see when a woman moved her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ c@@ mark to try to taste back@@ ups .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation as she looked , she moved out and put it back into the shelf .
she went further and pro@@ hi@@ ked four pairs of sub @-@ tops in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman commanded the under@@ p@@ ants before they put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the stock market they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the base , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and pro@@ hi@@ ked them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discrete place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they dropped off the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously have not fallen , because they put it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other sub@@ tro@@ users before it finally decided that her would say nothing , went back and out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that they might be observ@@ able - or to think about the person who would like to buy the under@@ p@@ ants who tried them . &quot;
Mrs David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how hard to think that someone would take shelter at home , who had an other person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs David@@ son added : &quot; as I got with , the staff tried to pull the gar@@ ment from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and figure out that a different woman had her and res@@ umed and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , consciously . &quot;
all products listed in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ceas@@ e@@ fire
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a bit safer .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers on a close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the rear , this video will show you how to turn the spinning box for your pre@@ dat@@ ors .
if one gets closer to you from behind , then you should turn to the turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the wal@@ k@@ way , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon then between your front @-@ arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bows .
boun@@ ce him then with the knee into the bar and twi@@ sted while the ag@@ gres@@ s@@ ors cl@@ ashed before pain@@ s , the weapon from his hands . strike it with the run and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon on him .
with anxiety , who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the wal@@ nut , grab the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the gun at the same time and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun out of his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi for@@ ge .
but keep in mind that there is a prey on the safest means to exagger@@ ate your money - unless you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
Reis@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x to a serious examination - by having some of the most dirty and ec@@ st@@ ful locations of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and Travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k threw its course on a euro Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sin@@ but@@ t of a draw@@ ing@@ ette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the res@@ ili@@ ence of its immune system .
in front of the le@@ aning of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what it is going to be .
but the experiment performed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ in@@ th &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light .
the thought to le@@ dges the flush button of a draw@@ bar , which was already used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with physicians and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , what he le@@ cked out , more than a bad taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and he ate unique and wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to sink of toilets , the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms , and mud . &quot;
in the film he was in any case justified .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ dis@@ line showed a L@@ umin@@ ometric number of over 4000 units .
compared to that , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry number is made of fresh hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian rest@@ room , which he refused to devi@@ ate , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry more than 4000 units was , while fresh hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ date produced the travel trade &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ up@@ th , &quot; which shows the total number of different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst , which I have rolled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not complain here because it is in@@ geni@@ ous here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ in@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company includes Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we carried crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings that ended up so we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us Ian call us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I had made my respect for Ian , when he had noticed some of the things I have instru@@ cted him to lick , just like the ek@@ el@@ ist Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad we received some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents l@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent told that they are at least occasionally to use products that are buried l@@ ac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us bacteria .

T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being removed from their estate , sho@@ cked cre@@ denti@@ fied of housing estates were property in a irre@@ par@@ able condition .

the family have been spot@@ ted and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment is no longer to repair .
she said , &quot; It was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is pres@@ um@@ ably considered to be a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in time in the apartment , and the police said that the terror which the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ah , shy from residents , drugs of drugs , drugs and over@@ hanging scre@@ aming , stretching and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an arrangement for ancient social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
we were acted in the estate in which drugs were traded in the past , the wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were wi@@ ped out .
neighbours said that she saw her on the street and regular the police had to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner this week of violent inci@@ dents of the estate after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ es were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours that said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to live !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , told it to co @-@ operation the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , by which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ flowing side of the church house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were dis@@ car@@ ded .
he added : &quot; it is a shame , that it was a r@@ ust to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the last step to take into Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case , since the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have been brave on us and have provided us the information to have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will don@@ ate a lot of neighbours and gives the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Skel@@ don received a fine , after she was inde@@ b@@ ted to the owner of a drug of class B in commercial law .
she claimed that money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came on a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will rent ten@@ ant , who do not adhere to the household order
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ es should be a clear warning to the other tenants which do not adhere to the household order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that without self @-@ prepar@@ es , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners in order to protect our communities .

a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ pointed and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is as somewhat expressed as concerns , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
after being thrown at 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , now grow the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ik@@ as Christians , who asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt of false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his well @-@ known media @-@ media .

he is doing nothing else than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;

then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press report , the Party of Tru@@ mp is expected to give funds to support his election campaign , he should not present no better survey values .

Olympia : tri@@ ck@@ ly fraud at the doping @-@ test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity Commission .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics is threatened after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud process at an intelligence control in the Olympic village Kenya has sent a trainer to Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee with , immediately set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , was given a ur@@ rec@@ t in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was reported by the team@@ leader K@@ eni@@ as from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doping Contro@@ ll@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the World Association IA@@ AF has the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to use its own investigations distributed a IA@@ AF @-@ speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; it says in a IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the doping control station and signed up as the F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the sample is released and signed , &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for the training checks of the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was in 2015 in Beijing Cup with over 800 meters .

in the announcement of the IO@@ C re@@ directed more than 2000 intelligence controls in front of the Rio Olympics , it is uncommon to be pointed out before that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into vision@@ ary .
the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ doping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the W@@ ada made Kenya from the list of countries whose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doping @-@ control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the rules of the W@@ ada are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly succeeded that in Kenya is readily available and there should be a significant ment@@ alities of sport fraud .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the process it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide and systematically weigh@@ ed .
as a result of the summer playing , Russia L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ l@@ ads were excluded from the summer playing .

we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have am@@ ber music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ dest Maria .
she is reminded with melanchol@@ y on their loved ones with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dancing .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel , oh so on , I feel her and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character , whom I used as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ am@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with her .
it is an in@@ hibited man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ am@@ el is so an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is a necessity for him .
you can see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !

&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradi@@ cated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president called for the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks will look for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire market as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer was destroyed by teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not adapt and Erdo@@ gan lo@@ aves , sitting on packed bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ ge@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported by calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks was already the biggest group of eligible for political persecution by the coup in Germany .
as of 30 June , 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all as the asylum entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this survey cannot be found in front of war , poverty or fu@@ tility .
asylum entitled according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , thus by governmental side , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it we@@ acts &quot;
stran@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day battle - which is attached .
the locals who are to be convinced by the electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers are on vacation .
most of the tourists that are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
to do this come practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , posters , posters , balloon , fli@@ r@@ amps , and count on the end voices , to apply only aw@@ k@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last Feri@@ a ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to pass over to the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win S@@ ell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD since 1998 has the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling is how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ ak cuts and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ dust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ ell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes a almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat a little bit with the people , just as it was already his legendary rep@@ ain@@ ant predec@@ essors Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors from the old feet have gotten and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel to flour@@ ish the b@@ lossom of the Af@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We created the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rise to the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is probably going to cost the beautiful office right now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with their peak channel data , the Interior of Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it &apos;s when you make the wrong time at the right place campaign .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to mainstre@@ am ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also shame not anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the northeast @-@ CD@@ U also largely disp@@ enses at the usual electoral boo@@ ths on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so does co @-@ ordin@@ ate , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has marked that in the country you are cap@@ tivated the base that it must be very strict , again a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will find it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the lands of the country barely any .
the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers Kok@@ ert to his collabor@@ ator is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where it we@@ h@@ eth , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much at stake , S@@ ell@@ ering its SPD now has now called to an ambitious election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats finally met with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
on the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Classifieds , with seven per cent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to make the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make out of the holidays need a modern virtue , and decorate their choice of choice into the internet .
&quot; online @-@ Ele@@ ctions , &quot; says it the governor Claudia Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers on Sp@@ ur@@ am search for native vote among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ can@@ did@@ ine , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and it is also still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral vacation in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : guest houses suffer from lock@@ out
on the speed , with which the B 27 is sandy , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only against 20 pm , there is all@@ al@@ ted praise .
&quot; they have done everything pretty soft , &quot; told El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ Gas station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the South during the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready .
it will also be praised that will be responsible for the construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting up the containers .
since the construction site took place on Monday to south and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been removed and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from Of@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the exit by the village seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President @-@ related management of the re@@ organisation of the re@@ organization of Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many of the easy paths examined and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to that there is some truck in living areas .
as the velocity limitation has not been observed , the community ampli@@ fies the measurement @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ s .
&quot; there was considerable abundance , &quot; says King , who made herself on site about the situation .
they have already been lit@@ tered for two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 stil@@ ts in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been further dra@@ ined , but it has become more quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the street is open again .
business@@ men do not have to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation after them has led to sales accounts , each one that is asked to look through .
however , some more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er talks Thomas Sul@@ z , of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also one that is of course missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most exploited are the parks along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already existence @-@ threatened .
not only him , but all hosts have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
they were missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue has increased to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road re@@ formation started its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff has to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , the policy could have been re@@ acted .
instead , ruling Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be financial compensation , with the advice given to the hospitality , otherwise the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now , they also need the disadvantages , which result in the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a lot was gener@@ ously done .
in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant is continued .
after all , the family business has been in this business since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
that any other regular cust@@ um@@ ers are less common due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can not drive , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
that his stem cell dates back to the end of the refur@@ bish@@ ment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and bird gri@@ d@@ oll , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the impact of the B 27 construction works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis which has experienced its Gast@@ stätte in its long@@ time history .
six months construction work , that is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly being rob@@ bing in laws on behalf of terror attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , indoor Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère lies a double safety package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ment status do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ sts say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his suggestions be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Federal Minister of Minister for the presentation of his new security policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are demanding nobody .
others , more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also share with this I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as interior ministers , it is located at results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère for@@ ged a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security body should take care of the b@@ aking encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU directives and arms in arms and arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies is not surprising .
in part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second place for proposals which has so far failed to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and compete with double citizenship in the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the CD@@ U man is one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still hold this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which no chances of the co@@ ali@@ sts might have any chances .
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they partly have it in themselves : it is planning quick @-@ fixing investigations and more possibilities for detention of people from exp@@ ulsion .
refugees who are directly fet@@ ched into the country should have checked their smart phones before and open social media account for a safety check @-@ in .
in case of di@@ ul@@ ence for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to be worse than until now - about those who commit crimes , or to consciously throw their papers to waste their identity .
some of them is politically and legally un@@ cle .
some also works un@@ sealed and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memorial , for instance - is the question : what has this actually happened to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said in abstr@@ action that the assass@@ ination of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
moreover , many people in the face of the high refugees are worried about the safety .
and things that the people are deeply employed , let themselves not be cl@@ amped in electoral periods .
the inner safety is enormously in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then , the attack in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the locking is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
the European Union and the SPD are thus increasing its position on the subject of inner safety .
over the past few days it went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ger argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments ch@@ iefs also call a Bur@@ ka ban , and a recur@@ ring from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also suitable for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a return from the double pass he kept nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have the discussion in Germany very fri@@ vol@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you re@@ discover it , be not sensible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban , he have constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ tionally arranged at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , it still needs to be showing .
there is a lot in what could care for argument .
but the SPD is also trying to profile yourself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel is not sign@@ aled to talk with caution and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor comes Volkswagen gli@@ den@@ ser .
despite diesel cars as the export @-@ off world @-@ wide .
but not in all markets it runs smoothly .
in the recall campaign there is a vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts to discharge the ship@@ pers in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest pas@@ sports can continue in the course of the year despite the diesel standards thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets further than a plus .
but in July it weak@@ ened the VW brand in particular in Western Europe and is res@@ umed to res@@ ale the total sale of such as the company released in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand has sold 40 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales grew 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the supplies of almost a six @-@ sixth .
bran@@ ding head Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July primarily at two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it was given a sales agreement in some core markets with &quot; changed economic framework . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote said to the resign@@ ation from the EU , explained a speaker .
in the USA , where the exhau@@ st gas is first escal@@ ated , there is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the main affected households of the Lower Saxony can already be crossed by the diesel andal : after the first seven months only one supplier minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles is at be@@ ech .
the group leader Fred Kap@@ pler was further developing a sales office from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with software testing .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW , that the alteration of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting of the vehicles it has no deterioration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
the bus station transfers the customer after retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; warranty &quot; as it meant on Friday in a company .
reason are legal en@@ o@@ cr@@ acies .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen affor@@ ds his German customers now a guarantee for retro@@ fitting diesel models .
this would have confirmed this for the last Monday VW Representative of the Bundes@@ Transport Department .
from the Ministry of Transport , this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completely fulfilled the conditions of my inquiry Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; any devi@@ ations from it will not be accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor outputs after refur@@ bish@@ ment , no deteri@@ or@@ ations can be held and all de@@ approved vehicle values are retained unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was in a company .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen guarantees that customers for example will come half a year after retro@@ fitting approximately with a motor impact in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software too , even if the damage it has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any case of any other damage that nothing has to do with the exhau@@ st bu@@ d , it comes to an off@@ ence with regard to possible guarantees of warranty as it was called .
therefore VW use the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ sey demands from rich spar@@ ks in future criminal law - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , which will park 40 million euros on the bank or daytime accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual case and doesn &apos;t see in this no signal : normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ ing criminal pro@@ secution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
camps bank accounts for money during the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent reduction in prison .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and company customers for deposits over 100,000 Euro to g@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash accounts back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he en@@ rolled 40 million Euros for a long time , that could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot comprehend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are on the central bank account and make 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost will he now give after the &quot; urs@@ ory principle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to lay in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four assault , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and change rarely on other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy class of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to carry it alone , be &quot; labour @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or re@@ mitt@@ ances .
with pr@@ isons for deposits from three million euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian popular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ at@@ bank branches in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay de@@ pre@@ conditions for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ sey there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is fully equipped from property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if they paid for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 @-@ based cooperative G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not known any further banks to charge a compensation for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Pop@@ ular Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ Banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich at the end of June explained : &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives opposite the private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany do not enjoy themselves in the width .
destination records : who does not buy sound@@ plates ?
lonely men middle aged men love hard drives .
before you rush to a comment , to over@@ see him under the alias of non @-@ avenue men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the revealing re@@ development of sound plates is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to embrace the news of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are all the forecasts according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ is@@ mic group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ters dis@@ retain their feelings sooner ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend their alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but how are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a humble servant and wild stri@@ cken before I res@@ ale my hands and something determin@@ ant like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ hos was slow in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located , there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman , to switch the camera out for the next part , in which I stand at close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I went by Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ ord@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle aged man , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; says he .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 bikers .
this sound@@ proo@@ fing , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not responded to it home ) , suffer the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a substantial number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy sheets , which he could not afford to buy when they were released and again objects , which he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60@@ s , early 70@@ ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I have probably had something to young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy sheets are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , which works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ go@@ v @-@ profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who will have influenced by the medi@@ al , people who have heard about com@@ eback and led themselves to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have har@@ dened their collection to 1998 or 1999 .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves back their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age point .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores provide a soothing community of equ@@ ine @-@ minded community .
according to WE@@ Z some of the elderly customers took the contact to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of confidential sound stress , from objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful che@@ der@@ men .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material propriet@@ ors as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
it &apos;s like a collector for me and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sol@@ dering a member of one of the plate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not yet ended .
the survey was also found out that 41 % have a record player , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I was bl@@ unt through a stack of wick@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , which works in the sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it is definitely going .
more productive , less music @-@ free .
we have people who say : &quot; I do not have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly coming .
mu@@ cks that has devoted to the sound@@ proo@@ fing is almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower crowd when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teenagers and women middle aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the most popular shops - Wild Be@@ ast New thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ ni@@ fied pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks quite lonely , but na@@ ecological trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to assert , if one stands beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the boards available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ her@@ edi@@ um as a large @-@ box .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates do not have a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is ... &quot; they drive with a loving sigh@@ s .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it truly is unique .
my last stop is a store by which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban Out@@ f@@ itters .
while I indicate the semb@@ lance of je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , observe a group of young teenagers who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley disk player .
to the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody looks like them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money to the industry and some buyers in the depths of So@@ hos for more could be sent , there is nothing to complain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and records , who exist in reality , records business and in online activity .
these people are likely to work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bum@@ ble@@ ing through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they ste@@ ered the star@@ red view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , which rises over the shoulders of an intermediate aged men .

French dish mis@@ ses offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French Court rejected a proposal of the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle from Calais to live in the thousands of refugees living in Calais .
in case of trial proceedings , the authorities argue that the state should be authorised to buy 72 provisional shops , in which individuals within the camp goods , from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair @-@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants sell .
the pre@@ fecture of Calais argued that these places should be lower , because they would pose a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and that a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the public and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals to people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional shops , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the Pre@@ fecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable .
the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers can offer .
one of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which will be operated non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um in the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to uph@@ old the Kids &apos;s Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closing will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this children of a catastrophe , most of which are eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants said on Friday that the number of people in the jungle bearing on over 9@@ ,000 people has asc@@ ended - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers throughout the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation digit speed : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices have been tested , which should be super@@ pos@@ ing especially effectively .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at random points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary Tem@@ se , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary gl@@ itter for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
but a lasting mobile design can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser technology can also simultaneously detect all vehicles across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable velocity and track message according to time , ro@@ cking and vehicle sizes can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced condition one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easy to get started , he is lo@@ wered in the measuring run , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and the other also disappear in the safe outside .
also , an integrated alarm system is to protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the indications of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .

UK gets silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finale on Thursday evening at a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten up with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ generative stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji has created a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ end , scheduled run and rotating power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad of all color .
the defeat was mis@@ led by the non @-@ poor Tro@@ phy of the Silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could be dropped to them in the finale .
but independently of this , Fi@@ ji could have taken a 15 @-@ man team in stock .
it could be a Tro@@ st for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite morning a gold medal will hang around his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is Princip@@ le Ben Ry@@ an , the former Chief of England in Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago , she lost in Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this slots will blow job , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mir@@ ac@@ ulous and let the attacks GB@@ s out of fun ab@@ pr@@ one .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. at , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ ocean Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner stir@@ ring .
with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai made another attack on the right corner which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely placed the ball .
a thir@@ sty ti@@ tu@@ te from Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but it just stopped .
in the seventh minute of J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ et through another slight tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still permitted to be .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes during the half @-@ time period and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant incident of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched a trial for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South @-@ sl@@ anders , whose fans sang , flags and danced at the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the plu@@ mage , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced himself and GB kic@@ ked her cr@@ ushing in the law@@ ns .
earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa in a scar@@ cely half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ er by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ member teams , secured the gain - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which into history go down , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who sat at the rod , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was al@@ present as she came to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax result , the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ em@@ powered bet , which is likewise exemplary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not the type of tri@@ umph@@ al ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in the Ruhr there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to ob@@ lige and contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make up the difference and there was nobody an assistant than the trainer who would survive 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
how he said he is ris@@ ky .
I had bub@@ bles , who is op@@ eri@@ ed and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads throughout .
it would have been a rather fine situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he may be treating early 2014 , outside the season , could start making the break up a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so it had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it one more larger .
in the incur@@ ability of the Vic@@ tory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ provo@@ king morning and tried to talk more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , which was the captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it repeatedly repeatedly , how much I have done this how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would have no one , so is a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or wishing to better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark concluded , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in the process , stay in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to let not get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make some wonderful .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we also did .
the couple will take up for one year before making decisions about their future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve B@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have been a lot of pressure .
in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an olymp@@ ic .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .

the Director of the Water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ in@@ Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water flo@@ tilla as a model for the large water producers .
this happened some time ago in the original in an article of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later , the water forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken passed the Second @-@ Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ed as a exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , the 31 year in the Second World War , it was 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Broad@@ brunn , has annually approximately 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the communities of Kirch@@ lau@@ er , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ er , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city Baun@@ ach .
for more towns and municipalities there are water delivery contracts .
the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d sta@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was appointed as a water@@ wart and was already appointed Managing Director of the Second World Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they obtained from the water@@ way building and maintenance work on office and organisational work , budget@@ ing systems , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the president .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , property sales in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , re@@ organization of the flood supervision ( 1999 ) and the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the participation of water cables .
there have been no interruption and I have always added any new features , because water is living and drinking water the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised her tru@@ sty , reliable and accurate service over 31 years .
he has worked with much heart of passion for his water @-@ purpose association and he established the water @-@ purpose association regularly , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he used to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ed group to the nit@@ rate of nit@@ rates before the reservoir of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler on the one hand praised water @-@ al@@ oud al@@ f@@ ons , who worked with him 28 years along with him .
he is the best water and he was a faithful boy .
together , we were an unbeatable team .
a highlights from his point of view he spoke the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ struc@@ turing of the two @-@ purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ on@@ ation at the flood with ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ur@@ ters on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night going through so the localities could be supplied with water .
also the supply of new brunn at once can only be maintained , because you filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms from loud , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called itself with us and expressed his life companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator be on the run , after him I will be publicly spot@@ ted .
by now nationwide , because S@@ ven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , mus@@ cular , bra@@ in@@ burned and has a glut@@ ton .
by now the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man has a glasses .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still bear the weapon with them , so the police .
who sees S@@ ven S shall call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship of rel@@ ational . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ators of 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck first wanted to do no information about the di@@ ther@@ or or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing of fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his eyes , a special command of special command ( SE@@ K ) was on the scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cr@@ isen@@ beut@@ ler and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial bur@@ dens resulting from the industry from the oil @-@ electricity promotion are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Sour@@ ces at the components for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ ag@@ se ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the ho@@ ok@@ es to generate electricity generation for its own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel industry remains an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Y , it now give up a basic certificate agreement with the European Commission for talks with competitive un@@ ambiguous Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel stations , all an EEG @-@ cover set of 20 percent .
but also these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for own power generation .
in this way the status quo of the previous scheme will be largely fixed .
particular importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the EU law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation intensified more than the world &apos;s world @-@ largest producers in China given the weak@@ est domestic demand in China in the face of the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel con@@ fer@@ ns pricing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has felt a little relaxed .
for the one hand the import fu@@ hr@@ er on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects of China have risen in China .
unclear is how sustainable the price is sustainable .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p continued to be careful on Thursday .
last , the prices would have been more stag@@ nating .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to close the closing of individual works .
in the German steel industry there were around 8@@ 6000 people at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel producer remains cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and mounting orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons of good six percent less steel than in the previous year , as the economic association has rus@@ hed to steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the present quantity went back in succession to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is increased by two per cent under the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with rising output .

the singing has already accompanied her entire life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the course of teaching , she took the subject of music and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it .
after a sample it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of more lively , she says .
they are very good in doing so doing their health and mind .
for singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Sen@@ iors .
most of the sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
due to regular meetings , sen@@ iors can make social contacts and foster .
because often , social and family structures exist at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organising themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs regularly demands , but also in everyday life not as fast as pu@@ ff@@ ed .
even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour community of the senior organisations .
in the older generations the common bond had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains it .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories often linked to positive emotions of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , he denied themselves denied events for long back events .
with singing , the head is also claimed a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other senses - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practise themselves not only on themselves .
another positive aspect is the acknowled@@ gment that one learns through the singing in the choir , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : when I look for something long , I will better and alert beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces us .
good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t forget that alone - at 50 Sin@@ igo people , who list@@ ens to when a tone goes next to it ?
looking for the suitable offer have sen@@ iors different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone out of the acquaint@@ ances in a Sen@@ or@@ ench@@ or , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can contact the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ or@@ ench@@ ant@@ ages can also be found via the internet .
those who have no access to the internet may ask the family , friends or neighbours around the internet request .
who desire has to sing , should join a choir av@@ enger H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - this is true of any age .
cats react sensi@@ bly to scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the ru@@ stling of cats on adult animals has .
to their surprise the mi@@ ths also did not let the males do not cold - however they kept in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the detection of kittens &apos;s on the eyes of the little ones .
they are responding to ten percent more quickly on lu@@ te of kittens travelling in great need , as scientists have found out of the veterinary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the ruins of kittens , but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ths of less and strongly inherited juven@@ ile for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is first author@@ itarian study published on this Friday at the &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; published on this Friday .
in a previous study the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens is different with the ur@@ gency of their emergency .
a total of nine adult female choirs were observed and eight females from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a bunch of babies which were taken for three minutes out of the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger ch@@ illed kittens , which have additionally been lifted up .
the researchers continue their results despite the low sample of endurance for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those , who had not yet grown up , re@@ acted differenti@@ ated on the horror , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out faster to the loud@@ speaker when this ru@@ fe played a very succ@@ es@@ ful kit@@ ten .
this ability may be in@@ cum@@ bent or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ o .
in the past , scientists have already examined many times in humans the reactions of women and men to baby monitors .
some studies also showed that women react sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to the Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ po@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the one @-@ time football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ er@@ r had been en@@ forced arrest warran@@ t .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey it is again an important football match . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ bish@@ ments between Bo@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line obvious : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
already during the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the exceptional state after the uprising in July , the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so he will not stop the football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ onn@@ r , the pro@@ secution issued a warran@@ t .
according to this , the South in America has now been thrown into the South of America , a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ po@@ r should be adher@@ ents to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who will be responsible for the coup by President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the first one applies for 90 days , even until October , it was in fact that the life of the most Turks , however , does not affect the life of the most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the closer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan is declared on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of workers &quot; visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the big@@ ness of the Turks but faced by dramatic experiences in the story is the strict ref@@ us@@ al of military put@@ rid .
even so even the fans can agree - regardless of whether you are a heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or gu@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially coming back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value introduced the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season under evidence : with 17 gates and nine templates in all the competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end of the game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ winners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured Po@@ kal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found the disap@@ point season for the record champion an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; plays early in the Europe League .
in the Southern of Li@@ g it is only rank six .
the season was not good .
the podium was the only way to gain something .
&quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Hab@@ kt@@ as , the game was going better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who runs over 26 tracks as an Sü@@ ver @-@ gate @-@ gate the base to the 14th title .
that is also the reason that fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
he had announced the AC Florence under the agreement and passed to Bo@@ kt@@ as only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez , after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; if Mario had to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; zi@@ pped the journal &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ man Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker should be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce about one third of his to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite intelligence : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was closed twice due to dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics squ@@ ad can only laugh - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brain doping - how before the lines are played at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , which had been fitted out shortly before playing a doping - lock it was off at its start ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ ging of fl@@ ou@@ fl@@ ing and be@@ bu@@ ed .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ring scene : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked it with its appearance .
when stood that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the doping @-@ past during the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was imprison@@ ed for two times due to dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ eger from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jama@@ ica ) : the two @-@ time olymp@@ ic and si@@ eben@@ o@@ fold World Championship in 2010 had to re @-@ sit a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery you had had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old had defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the olymp@@ ic prize from 2012 to 2016 was tested positively on the stim@@ ul@@ ant stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine by 2016 .
per@@ kovic pass the wis@@ ely intake and has been locked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gol@@ d@@ war@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics
a means of penis enlargement should have been responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ tre@@ k .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is about 200 and 400 m of the so far fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably barely one ath@@ lete have been identified as many medals .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after the testosterone @-@ doping has been determined .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the also recognized bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was returned as a result of a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m it is placed on the rank two of the world @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ing list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the Wel@@ fare and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May positively , but must still start in Rio .
at the 29 years old World Championship in the world , references to the intake of a har@@ b@@ ated dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ Doping Agency W@@ ada fell off and ran away on July 13th .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Ost@@ ro@@ cher@@ in in@@ ju@@ red - Multi@@ h@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the wife , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ ag@@ early .
it suffered schn@@ apps and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
I planned your visit@@ ation for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacation island of Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , the Austrian citizen are also still unclear .
the State Department also stands in close contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok the Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday nights in a excav@@ ated district .
according to police force a Tha@@ is killed and approximately 20 people have been in@@ ju@@ red , including the Austrian corporations , three Dutch , three defeats and three Italians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning again two winding rates went high , according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs of bom@@ bs .
near the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong has been in@@ ju@@ red by police information and a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded then another bomb , which sle@@ w a city address .
according to the public in a flower head , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally there were det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded .
it is from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ ds are the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Military @-@ Major Dan@@ ai Cher@@ eth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ ag@@ ee Fre@@ ag@@ early prior to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express yourself about possible moti@@ fs - probably it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks of a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ bing muscle separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police explained the assass@@ ination of attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ person in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather it is assumed that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities would have kept secret indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places .
still be unclear which group behind the attacks .
the police took their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not depend for tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ hungry bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its homepage , as well as the instructions of Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ par@@ kl@@ a and surrounding area .
according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , do not require necessary journeys into these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were after a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this spatial resolution has had great influence over the years to come .
jun@@ ta chief and prime minister of Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to kill chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism .
the Mil@@ itä@@ gir@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , the kingdom keeps itself good , the kingdom has again led to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting a handle for the military rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years .
more than 6,@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
barely one year ago , Bangkok has been killed in an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blu@@ est attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the Constitutional Court also made the association under review under review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clu@@ e to the aspirations of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social democratic principles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said constitutional Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the emig@@ rants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of personal identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ tion@@ alist in nine Bundes@@ länder , Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the national laws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally try extremi@@ sts , speaking them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts .
this is no extra advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to address the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are in a special way pr@@ one to .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last , there had been reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge .
the possible contacts of this species can be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ ak - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , their target device is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
decisive factors is whether such persons can control the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the clear increase of law @-@ motivated off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak on new rights in this context .
but we have observed in recent years that it can give right @-@ correct structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further legal group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee centres or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs are planning .
a clear@@ ance or pan @-@ wide control of leg@@ is@@ r@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many ra@@ ids went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ ar leaders at asylum seekers have not been known as a criminal , politically motivated pro@@ secution or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have therefore committed crimes committed with right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which however have radi@@ cal@@ ised by far right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
do not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records to the head@@ lines with the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight ba@@ thers from Ethiopia is so slow to see temporarily no more in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ te has subsequently become the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a gap of 48 seconds on his move and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his rather sporting figure , which attracted the attention of the international media to himself .
why the 24 @-@ year old takes part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in underground countries well known .
since in T@@ HO@@ PE@@ D@@ ICS the most ath@@ lete wanted to run , he simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the big race .
fast , the first nickname was made round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media signed it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drawing on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well @-@ trun@@ ks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made himself the English tab@@ lo@@ ids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he suggested only with a minute and almost five seconds on the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ ale attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete for more than 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was an@@ ized M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Gf@@ K leadership appears after disap@@ point business figures
the consumer research agency Gf@@ K de@@ grades his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ sli@@ ces were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the research company Gf@@ K admitted that the chair of Chief Chamber Matthias Hart@@ mann could be even more uncertain , the longer the successes they promised .
turbul@@ ence at the top of Nuremberg &apos;s market research agency Gf@@ K : once again disap@@ point business figures and the resign@@ ation of the company , the world leader is the world leader in front of a personal new beginning .
Gf@@ K executive head aims to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Gr@@ inding was already det@@ ained with effect from 12 September from the supervisory body .
the management of the Executive Board handed over the previous board member Gerhard P@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on September 1 , divided the company .
he is officially supposed to assume the function of a &quot; CEO &quot; until a successor was found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the resign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a corporate speaker on Friday .
who will be able to make the market research into the future , be still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ri@@ dden it was on Friday , at the shareholders , be the disappointment about the continued success of the re@@ directed restructuring of the years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been participating in the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of the restructuring is still not visible even after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in light of the last bad Gf@@ K business , each shareholder will eventually be un@@ steady .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the quot@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after decl@@ ines , the company had not able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , the turnover increased by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the comparable figure in the previous year .
during the first half of the year , revenues generated with 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter showed above all the measured value of the company in the light of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s financial experience required in the Consumer Experience sector will be allocated to 139 million euros , the Group under the stroke is a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
the Gf@@ K still owned its annual profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - bus slip into cr@@ ush@@ c@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
at an accident of a coach bus with 43 sen@@ iors as the passengers are in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday in Č@@ esk@@ audi@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) eight people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 years old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to ste@@ ate its details in an opposite way , partially in the opposite way .
the bus came to the right from the street and sli@@ pped into a mo@@ at , like a speaker at the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the position of the bus the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ men liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six life@@ tro@@ cars and a special accessory drive came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ finished travellers were brought back by a scheduled bus back to the Karp@@ ac@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel business .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load of the load and possible witnesses to get in contact with the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of waste are from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare No 44 euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2,@@ 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( until now 2.8 billion ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf at the latest , the se@@ wage fee will be increased once again if appropriate actions are necessary .
after a man@@ s@@ layer of calculation , the se@@ wage rate will be at Az@@ endorf then at 4.@@ 37 Euros per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported in the approval of the budget through the land@@ rat@@ ernity @-@ Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems run sub @-@ covers .
the market Kas@@ endorf is required due to its legal foundations to operate facilities for cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies are taken out of world distance , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , to take deeper into the po@@ ck@@ et@@ book .
the ag@@ it@@ ator increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of charges for se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - or sub@@ categories from the previous calculation period .
the gra@@ zing ag@@ gra@@ dation increases Schmidt therefore , that at all three se@@ wage systems , with a very small se@@ wage @-@ se@@ wage , the between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year fly .
thus , due to the low distribution basis for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have serious .
in addition , the se@@ wage from all three systems is slightly declined .
furthermore , the underlying cal@@ cul@@ ation period in all three facilities were not least due to their age and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for World S@@ culp@@ ture , Neu@@ dorf , and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ kin World pole , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and at the pond @-@ position Lop@@ p had to be built for almost 20 years of operation the first cl@@ amping , the Kl@@ är@@ amm and an additional ventilation can be built to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expendi@@ tures the continued super@@ visor and maintenance costs which are to be considered in accordance with the new regulation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still considerably below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone cottages made clear that at low se@@ wage fall in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the process , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs at se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above facilities will remain prec@@ arious in view of stone buildings on the duration continues to remain prec@@ arious , especially as one could not extend the supply area of se@@ wage @-@ water he@@ ater for these plants , because it deals with public institutions .
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was on a monthly basis in July 1 % .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , than positive 0.@@ 2 % were booked .
the annual average de@@ flation of the past 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the CP@@ I index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amoun@@ ted to 10@@ 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amoun@@ ted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ ate &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ur@@ gency to the races .
with his filter tool , it makes sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already as absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are und@@ et@@ ected , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million improved Sel@@ f@@ ters per day .
all mis@@ tours get to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have moved criticism in the past that they have been accused that the app of Black@@ face @-@ shaped or white skin would be a beauty ideal .
when this week presented a filter to some users , who gave them s@@ lu@@ cent , false teeth and en@@ rap@@ ed che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow sigh@@ ted . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company with diversity has .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation have been widely spread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it would have disabled .
the company offered an excuse . the filter was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , the pedi@@ m@@ atism experienced , reminded of the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful stereotyp@@ es .
other refra@@ ined the Ani@@ me @-@ comparison deci@@ de@@ dly .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose t@@ we@@ et was widely spread over the photos , that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and do@@ omed to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ parts of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter @-@ effects .
it shows that the filter is not b@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted was dra@@ gged into the rec@@ alling extre@@ mes .
sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are di@@ sil@@ ly in terms of race than their older counter@@ party - could be more likely to expect to expect sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filter is a picture that is ins@@ ulting , &quot; it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided who works as a Product @-@ manager and Ingenieur@@ in for Medium , her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account to extingu@@ ish others to do the same .
in an essay on media and in a phone interview , she said that they think that rac@@ ted controversy is a lack of diversity among the management practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the big part white , just male leadership and ended their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin @-@ colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to tell what about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , it refused Sn@@ ap@@ chat , the cultural backgrounds of its staff to discuss , but according to a spokes@@ person the company recently set up a personnel responsible who focused on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said in turn , that she will be closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not ok . &quot;
Military Protection of ISIS intelligence services , presents Committee of Congress
military relations with the United States Central Command changed further information to draw an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed on site , announced a investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the re@@ publi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , reported by a great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence Services analy@@ st , reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessment on American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news agencies , which were typically disp@@ at@@ ched by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com comm@@ anders , were regularly allowed to have a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions on site could have been allowed and were negoti@@ able positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers will suffer if poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are enough up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report provides detailed results in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
although there is no direct reference to that governmental spi@@ kes given under Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how analytical approaches were exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half year 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot;
for example , there was a Cent@@ Com An@@ sen@@ er publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of mos@@ anders could start as early as April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ can congresses from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 the leaders of the Central Command changed the following reports to run the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life after giving them that an@@ alysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed knowledge and will be continued during investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway at the Austrian Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the news forum published on Thursday its own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the preparation of professional estim@@ ations of Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the most valuable democr@@ at in the comm@@ as , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ ps , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ ps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the morality of an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over@@ ly little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats said to have no evidence of a calling of the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ st as regards a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times reported a investigation by the main inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to the complaints of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ zer .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ d@@ r. Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press service of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Department would not comment any reports of Congress , while inquiries were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also made that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Defence Department welcome a controversy on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation of investigations on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has now been made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of the last year have raised the question which President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ or@@ estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis @-@ regions .
the cri@@ tique of the secret formations over the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at the recommendations of many an@@ alysts at the Iraq &apos;s recommendations and had little time to make himself thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in an uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after specifying a government position that the statements of the Government attacks against the refin@@ ement of the terrorist group would have taken no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional fin@@ ery would have taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger comm@@ anders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure due to his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that won the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the winter competition and are still alive in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that remains un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both of the two teams will get from the first and second place in their group .
the first plat@@ inum will go slightly longer from the road that the other group will attack .
as always the game may go out on Saturday the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed in the last of 12 places in the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the founder of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since it could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 came , in which for her and her team all went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn the things for better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ ings around in London that we have now .
we have the rod can be carried out completely .
on Thursday night B@@ at opened the gate in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash from the se@@ am .
India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and kept the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am played the game into their hands .
she carried a Sprint with a flat ball over the left side , moved into the middle and took the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the shut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ gu@@ ardian of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which had previously had a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will hin@@ ge will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are growing and in@@ es@@ capable of putting a rapid rel@@ ess between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is framed by the w@@ rist@@ watch to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ pod to the tri@@ pod .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen when talking your neighbors in the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ hop menu without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ y@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los to hear .
and then there are log@@ on Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s too warm with di@@ m@@ ples would definitely have been sent to this known name that would be sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , when he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights during the winter trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not show any event immediately .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always float the pec@@ toral and may it reign long .
but if I might want to make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline , has been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was noted the last 16 years so many that I had asked , did not know that there is at all a olymp@@ ic name .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US ple@@ aded a competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had made a athletes who made it up to the end .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans to share for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain external rock @-@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ um school as the one that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the cart@@ o@@ ant tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving , the two sports that it is essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board .
emerging vi@@ ctors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moves ( rotating , yeast and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
you will be evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ap@@ ro@@ b after execution , difficulty and &apos; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ one athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are inter@@ tw@@ ined in Rio .
the most common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ ons need to continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output , but in the tel@@ ev@@ isions also another cav@@ ity : that of the world or the olymp@@ ic index .
the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atics - and it is enough to stir even a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I find themselves when watching this games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces from , apparently he@@ el@@ os like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ less again upwards .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , not v@@ aults in the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant removal of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification round and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC is shown the du@@ bi@@ ds as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked compared to the general tum@@ ult .
if the appreciation of consciousness can only be achieved through the att@@ endant and the lens of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ se , new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , long a allies of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia , to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that zig demonstr@@ ators were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in wal@@ nut .
is Ethiopia just to crack together ?
in the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past few months , protest against the government began to strike the country and spread more and more into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave up that polic@@ emen were shot on zig un@@ armed prot@@ esters and sle@@ w .
moving the videos over the protests , probably from the last or early this year , show how security people hit young people with sho@@ cks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a incoming inquiry .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep up this country and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , in order to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expan@@ sion@@ ary at the respectable temp@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new move in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , the dis@@ sid@@ ents were effective for silence .
many were sent into exile or to the prison , or were driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ies .
the entire youth is prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the spice attack in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this z@@ ag , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
an@@ alysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less forced by the turbul@@ ence over the last few years , and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter after years of suffering from the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate via social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter , which at regular intervals , does many people still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies who hide from where they are staying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they were so much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ rac@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ zed the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia , mostly Christian @-@ countries , in politics and economics , while they are the Oro@@ mos explo@@ ded , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ land areas .
but even this is not changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
an@@ alysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in it to perceive early indications of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to use opponents and to make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic principle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian New prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been selected from relatively un@@ sigh@@ ted grounds in order to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region Nord@@ ä@@ Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
an@@ alysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time , Ethiopia has experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of protest prot@@ esters , according to information from analy@@ st , apparently circul@@ ated by the government and subsequently stolen from the government .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively fast past .
development experts - Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , as the new pend@@ ent move , as well as for their measurable advances in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ mis@@ sal of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month attacked prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , run by Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming ever more common in social media .
an@@ alysts are saying that the protests of the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently rus@@ hed out that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the West will clearly support democracy , he does not want his allies to collapse into an already vol@@ ati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his Cla@@ im Obama founded ISIS . &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot; had been
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to disp@@ el the last controversy on Friday that surround his campaign by demonstrating that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton had been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not the serious meant .
this clari@@ fying statement defines new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidential data of the Republi@@ can , whether he will be able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his collabor@@ ators who seek to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the peculi@@ ar position , statements that he might not be meant to have .
after he had made the hint at an election contest on Wednesday night , Mr. Tru@@ mp had returned to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning t@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is just sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp was in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en this statement by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential race would not know anything about it .
the last storm of the cri@@ mp down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling revenues on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this issue again .
over Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead suggestions to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought to his defense in Sar@@ kas@@ mus .
at the end of July he attracted strong critic@@ isms , when he meant , the Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ tons emails , but explained later &quot; naturally , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the linguistic limits in politics and then shr@@ ink if necessary .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be added as they arrive , and then appropriate , &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication team that observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of making the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even more estim@@ ony so that its frac@@ tures have further declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics often to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ z@@ ites have brought his loyal co @-@ terrorism into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ ce@@ des , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bone , completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government was served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor mini@@ ster@@ in , it allowed to spread themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
in front of the electoral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them before , on each of his words , and to be bi@@ ased towards him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he poison@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; poor &quot; television expert , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats endor@@ sed by Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s excuse for a further proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once more p@@ ushes over the price of the market , café is coming back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a shame café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced the b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
indigenous people worked as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ val city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ara wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel is excluded and is now a soap @-@ bus@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is re @-@ finding .
a recovered Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ standing staff of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a customer was offered to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the dre@@ ad &apos;s same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and oni@@ on oni@@ ons .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
the café serves no beer more , for this there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said to Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , that he noticed a static current in old corporate clients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old clients have also been displaced by prizes in Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee ham , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that fell to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual iter@@ ation Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the start of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably to be the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came after seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ ch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he won &apos;t be Gro@@ ll about it that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , they were offered by the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , a special soap for b with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish market and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he decided to meet them quickly so that his new neighbours are welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold coffee into the bottles and sell them .
there is a chance that the café has expanded onto a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb came out to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tri@@ bal and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entry of the Lok@@ et and the Order felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; I had to do this , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after its climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roos@@ evelt took lunch at the O@@ val Office .
the g@@ our@@ mets had President Roos@@ evelt , a f@@ ai@@ ble for in@@ geni@@ ous delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
the menu on this day was a bit modest : cor@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , potato har@@ b@@ ree and as dessert a P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in their book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ shoe Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in the store since the stock crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato har@@ b@@ ree and vegetable @-@ mixing .
when the re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ aten ordered it , this found the pair in a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was Erd@@ wal@@ nut , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little back@@ bone that su@@ cked the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have set itself in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was placed in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male enhancement workers and it was served fresh baked past@@ ures for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways on which the country turned out to be no more the lar@@ s@@ ap@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , an@@ ed theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gi@@ fted Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new budget@@ ary food : mysterious food like lo@@ aves and Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len were revi@@ ved to stap@@ le food , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le as &apos; wonderful Art , Es@@ sens@@ remains reco@@ vering , &quot; mer@@ ed Zi@@ egel@@ man , because chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ am@@ y sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ wall .
meat , which was for years the centre of the American cuisine has become a rare luxury .
peculi@@ ar mi@@ xes have been tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , you prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no popular addi@@ tive at the lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues his way : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , exagger@@ ated household income - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , the eating habits of the Land of such .
by published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become an &quot; household policy &quot; and to transform the challenge of transforming them as cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic le@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer in his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ ste as the million@@ th man of the world , which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with guru @-@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a nearly contaminated dining room and carried out a smo@@ king .
he was delightful re@@ traction .
President Roos@@ evelt had perhaps committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to stat@@ ute him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ ited of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roos@@ evelt took that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , has been rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the Legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave themselves better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s in @-@ law better understood - for example , as they couldn &apos;t throw food away .
&quot; it had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were the wind down@@ fall .
after the plate were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they pulled out and Co@@ e a dessert that they had cooked at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roos@@ evelt at noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , humble recipes had a real name to miss .
there was no be@@ aten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pped slightly rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amazing enough , it is not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a envelope .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few hated Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
by bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life in the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ king all to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died on a lap@@ bom@@ bs attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ met , &quot; a civil society group that has so far been saved to life according to image paper so far .
2@@ 900 volunteers bring their own life to the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans on the shining fla@@ x in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he has never seen himself , said loud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have rejected four facade bom@@ bs above the Alzheimer adia area , one was filled with chlor@@ ine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ bs of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest flu@@ ff is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland mostly only appear in winter to surface finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms up a 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland only with 150 years of offspring .
considerably , the Greenland shar@@ k along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average just 1.@@ 220 feet .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates to s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal .
this of long @-@ lon@@ eliness of life seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ ing in the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this span , which means for verteb@@ rates a World Record .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist employed already for a long time , that Greenland is a stone @-@ stone .
only missing the evidence .
Greenland is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter .
about the li@@ festyles of Greenland , researchers know accordingly little .
your time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ t measures it , when they pl@@ ain@@ ted six animals in front of the spi@@ der six animals with a transmitter .
loo@@ t make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a seal , another had taken the j@@ aw of a young polar bear .
possibly chase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice and look for Kad@@ aver that from higher water layers based on tor@@ angles .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Sv@@ alb@@ ard as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was about 81 cen@@ timet@@ res long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timeter .
to investigate the age of animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method of the lens of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the oph@@ thalm@@ ology has been created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the contained proteins are later no longer re@@ done .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons , attempts to cut greater amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the case of 220 cen@@ timet@@ res length of the third animal , the lens holder has a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens with which the cosmic rays can be created in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timet@@ res long Greenland shar@@ k a age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers of the length could be assigned an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters are likely to be on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland can be obviously at least one and a half centuries .
it may also be the case for verteb@@ rates currently in the world .
that such meth@@ us@@ al eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , in its bac@@ on on the neck a 120 year old resin @-@ tip , was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures it often runs the organism of the animals living there on savings .
so they mature later - and slowly slower .
to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume increases much faster than its surface , through which the animal is heat .
the heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than that of a gram Ele@@ ph@@ ant .
a further advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should tend to invest its resources in a long life .
construction site in the double pack
on the topic of building and building the community at the recent meeting will be focused on the topic of focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the committee taken on the communication of Mayor of Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recent living creatures can finally be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having clari@@ fied the real estate , Par@@ cel@@ es and resolutions , and the applications for survey could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; road path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der Road - Building cut 1 ) to interested parties has no longer in way .
the par@@ l@@ at is convinced that the out@@ lays in the rural and peaceful residential community Schön@@ au young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors equally addressed .
as it meant , construction will be able to report immediately in the City Hall , on the allocation of the plots , the community at the beginning of September will be advised in its September session .
to also request questions about the relocation of other industrial enterprises , associated with job creation , decided to come to the community , decided to change the community plan in sub@@ areas only in the spring of this year .
thus , the industrial estates are expanded there around two plots in direction of state @-@ 2@@ 112 .

&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , leader of the Competence &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money banks continue to pursue further from London from financial transactions throughout the EU .
the approval in the UK for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass has so far enough to be approved in the UK .
this is the only big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects some 10,000 new jobs at the Main &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Frankfurt , such as I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance assessment of E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate as directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is a great fund branch , but will also be worse in the infrastructure as Dublin as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine , the Mi@@ ets for first @-@ class commercial properties are also increased by 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate coun@@ seling Merc@@ er , the city is standing in place seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in square 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; de@@ duced the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit , my economic researchers .
they also speak the forces of forces : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 people .
Gilead receives constitutional costs from the Hepatitis C patent coming with Mer@@ ck
a US office ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc . , to the refund of the right costs , which were created from the Hep@@ ati@@ cal C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead is freed from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior on the part of Mer@@ cks , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions , covered .
in the collection of the law@@ suit on Thursday said US office in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to decre@@ e the expense that emerged during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck attempts with Gilead that dominated the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C drugs which can cure 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endant and property to laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir grants , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .
by the USA they supported forces that they have restored complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
from the US supported troops have re@@ conquered full control of the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left this , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .

clinics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 %
Hill@@ ary Clinton has published her tax return for 2015 , revealed for the presidential election of Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective German tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 million ended for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton had generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in free speech ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ leaders , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards with regard to financial transparency , &quot; was Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion known .
in a tick contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hi@@ des behind false ex@@ chan@@ ts and re@@ trac@@ ts in regards to his previous promises to publish his tax exemp@@ tions .
it is common for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax exemp@@ tions , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for its denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons of electoral campa@@ ed in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the release of the Presidential did@@ acy of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax tests are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critic , among other things , also the Republi@@ can presidential race of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already illustrated that its ref@@ us@@ al questions in relation to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business@@ men and various other connections are established , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and posted on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level re@@ public@@ ans Tru@@ mp demand his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential race has done in the last decades and release his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid for two years or only very little taxes , and a business journalist to the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this might still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state control has become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton provides a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a voting contest for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industry con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp at a meeting in order to exchange their taxes .
Buff@@ ett said , he was likewise subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have put &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
clinics &apos;s campaign launched tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid out an effective German tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % between the years 2007 to 2014 .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income is referred to as wage , unlike most Americans .
your main terrain was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 .

nature conservation in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from it , in man inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them which are filled with chicken .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation who had already strengthened the idea ahead of years , combined with the U.S. natural protection , providing volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ ani@@ as , to use a non @-@ violent vi@@ cious method for the protection of their houses and harvest without damaging the animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is World calls , which is dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

the first two steps include the illumin@@ ant of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not de@@ ported , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ li@@ ds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if it is lit , the con@@ dom with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust at Chi@@ lier in the air .
a touch rather usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
one last chance is an adver@@ tisers , which sho@@ cked a gold @-@ fire plant into the air and thereby creates a lou@@ der , bright explosion .

Jewish director suggests Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots en@@ gros@@ sed a media appearance after having betra@@ y that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli election , since it calls for Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann Israel tried to find Israel on the coun@@ sel@@ fish list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in Berlin , the capital of Germany &apos;s new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concl@@ usive decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it was ha@@ ste in the director , even more rage .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pres@@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; the director of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambass@@ ador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ merchant said this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the southern German newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were aston@@ ished and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a larger shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident involved a fairly large resonance in the Internet where people sc@@ anned the whole thing sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have announced the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was noted in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which stands at the class@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Israel failed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the southern German newspaper a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade summ@@ its between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an , grew by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in pages of Russian enterprises in the country grew strongly , distributed the Ambassador .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market .
of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade deal was between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 rise and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent total and bet@@ s $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading recovery was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is coming from an record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
last year , the Russian Foreign Representative about 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the economy in Russia .
one could say that the record figures for tourists in Russia from last year , broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambass@@ ador hope it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes out at home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last evening in the male team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for glory than the British team def@@ ends the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the pi@@ vot@@ al role , who had made his coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . the young and made the legend proud , when he came home after a victory of the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad ri@@ ats .
they repeated the trick , after they took place in March at the Lower World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the agent Jamie staff .
they did so in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys re@@ generate a gap , the ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw potential in the car@@ rots , which now un@@ folds .
execution , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ ader - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualification rounds a olymp@@ ic record , but in the standard @-@ towns passed the New Zeal@@ ander in the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
then after his turn left behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , in which exec@@ uting in a higher gear to slow it and allow con@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they asc@@ ended to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed a olymp@@ ic record in the En@@ dr@@ on and the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way of winning this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there was Hin@@ ts that he clearly fell to the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
with such a sur@@ passing victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was amazing to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
that is an event , a gold medal for the nation , seven of 10 titles were won in both Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape identi@@ ys it is in the area of the utmost that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day was also Steve Gu@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster born ) - an ou@@ gh@@ ute of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese that came from Ho@@ y equals .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely , alone to win .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal contest of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ga Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ ric race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , which won in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) today take place on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins are placed in focus .
he had taken off yesterday with persons from the qualification of his qualifications , as they called function@@ aries to measure its height .
in the run &apos;s female &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ends , av@@ elled Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the UK Team refers to its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sc@@ ar of medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London have crossed the expectations for Rio .
it &apos;s drama in the background , so the resign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April among Sex@@ es and Mob@@ bing mats , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
if one sees itself in the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like this is the legendary reputation of GB@@ s that reached its peak at the perfect moment .
the future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the contract demand
the future of the aluminum barrel of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - stand in the game , as the plant operator will announce the energy supplier and thereby repe@@ ating all delivery contracts , as the delivered energy companies rus@@ hed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria early this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a payout for 20 years has been exp@@ ired in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered during a closing .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ us effects , since the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa took the Point Henry melt , which resulted in a closure of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation for the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and lastly due to the current price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L , which supplied the large aluminium mel@@ ting with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , distributed that three additional owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the property of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Alum@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp. keep smaller percent@@ ages .
&quot; AG@@ L also assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means more physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting pot , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have become effective from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L told the value of the agreements already written in the annual amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to cancel the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it finished a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have been coming into force from November this year , even if there is still a statement found , why it came back from the contract .
an@@ alysts are due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closing of the Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility nearby Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of an@@ alysts at the beginning of the week , the head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that port@@ land consume around 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and tomato around 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generating set that would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ p@@ hi@@ an Reality TV Star , Leon is based on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ing edition of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Car@@ th@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ ans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ing of the US Vo@@ gue .
Leon , the brand ambass@@ ador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to crying , &quot; wrote Kendall .
the disclosure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre video ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ ans family ? ) , ges@@ tic@@ ated reality video that illustrates the whole Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this constitutes the most clever act of almost every birthday sep@@ tum ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you thought that we could have forgotten ? &apos; , with the honesty of a sign @-@ place at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave their other girls somehow at this publicity .
with a view to the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ ing of the Vo@@ gue , certainly started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ ra@@ de Big sister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were seen in April 2014 ) , but the Cover from the edition of the magazine is a League for himself .
the edition of the September is the most sought @-@ after issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a girth which resembles rather an image brochure than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adver@@ tisers ( L@@ aut fiber hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a ) of the 8@@ 32 pages of the ram@@ zer 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ ly is fores@@ een that over the last two years , pictures of the magazine are still found before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ rities , the models &quot; as a &quot; model , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prei@@ str@@ ated in and Di@@ or @-@ trademarks Jennifer Lawrence was in the Cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or adolescents from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner . )
they are truly talented women who are exhibiting in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last Cover , with the release of L@@ emon@@ ades one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ese position was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; Mi@@ st@@ pieces of Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings illumin@@ ate again , when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the ab@@ aster ride seems to pass over to the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold out of her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
mut@@ ation centres stand annually in 16@@ 0.000 people
more than 16@@ 0.000 inhabitants of the country are rejected each year by the municipal law centres , while the industry accounts for the effects of further middle cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , and needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ es , and who are looking for free legal advice and legal advis@@ es .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ l@@ aced , are ready for further reductions .
from June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose more than 30 percent of their federal states .
the director of the parish centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Assembly centres have revealed that thousands of people have already been refused for thousands of people each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the government would only get worse without a decision of the Decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; que@@ er community centres are chron@@ ically supported , which means thousands of people of important services that you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debt , families who were dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of a legal way and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
in June 2017 , the federal government will cut its funding by 30 percent , which means thousands of people from Queensland to be forced to Queensland to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the General Public Affairs and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to up@@ lift these medium @-@ cuts straight away , so people get the help they need to get in legal problems .
last year , the provincial government met their commitment to raise funds to national average .
it is now time to see the needs of the community centres and their customers , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Coalition Camp@@ a@@ ign after employees allegedly committed weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was charged because of alleged in@@ activity after it was told that her camp@@ agn@@ ant manager for North Carolina in February have directed a fire@@ arm to a staff while in February they were on a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the State of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini gave to have been waiting to have been waiting monthly for months to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , put his right pointer page on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ enzo Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment .
after joining the local and regional camp@@ agn@@ ant direction , Bord@@ ini established that for at least four more persons had the same experience with Phillip , he gave in the indictment .
&quot; weapons must not be frozen to put damage , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini .
the accus@@ ation occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential race held a rebellion when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - One @-@ Belar@@ usi@@ on@@ loo@@ t and weapons @-@ fre@@ unde - action should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was clear that media would have heard his words from the context and that he would not con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ate violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
b@@ ordin@@ is complaint requests compens@@ atory for damages from the campaign to breach of the duty of duty and by Philip due to personal injury and abi@@ ding mental damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s pres@@ ses@@ ho@@ ists in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip perceived as well absent .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U loose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for the ruling parties SPD and CD@@ U have been characterised by the SPD .
this resulted in representative surveys of the division of the IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government co @-@ government in the North could continue to govern , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and therefore would have good opportunities to set the government &apos;s government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD decreased from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
consequently , the party hinges on the CD@@ U only in front of the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ ak .
the Left was brought to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be present at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ it@@ ated in spite of an easy loss with 6 percent ( previously 8.5 per cent ) in the wei@@ ght@@ ens agricultural day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the day @-@ day .
during the period of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD &apos;s SPD applies only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U has only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they left behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ y would be present at 14 percent for the first time in the member of the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the success@@ ors now dominate the world - its manufacturer has experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost a half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which today would be enough for about two r@@ ams with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euros we can buy the devices still on the internet , but they originate somehow from the st@@ one@@ age of the dormitory .
but 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturers had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover , Germany as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in West@@ ent@@ ash@@ wood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the Communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , if also agon@@ izing slowly .
a calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be a similar one as a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
rather proud the price was : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , which is approximately 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ Spar@@ te of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today dominate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices sold , Samsung and Apple have been sold around 5@@ 55 million pieces on the Samsung and Apple .
the global sales volume of around 400 billion euros is worldwide .
this includes the well @-@ running stores of the innum@@ erable App @-@ provider and the t@@ elec@@ om operators .
there were a whole industry around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only beginning in 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he talked to three instruments in one : a music @-@ player , a phone and a Internet communication , all easy to use by touch screen .
the winning player from Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry that dominated the market had the watch .
you disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now you have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after its invention , is a matter of course .
on the cut , every German now has a look at his cell phone for 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all to gain the smartphone once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jan@@ ina Ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said in the Siemens Board of Human staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the olymp@@ ic mind and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like that in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will accomplish this again by creating new opportunities for local , and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will have already 10,000 new appren@@ tices to create 40@@ ,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport surroundings .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement h@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I have said that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ gly set wrong and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over@@ winds , but He@@ a@@ throw will answer any question .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single infrastructure projects .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport as well as in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion of infrastructure investments in time and budget - from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . it was built in the middle of the two busi@@ est cat@@ walks around the world .
now they are ready to provide a third run cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw is also to be one .
it is time for we to direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and to you He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .
Lord Paul D@@ ot@@ ton is Chairman of the He@@ a@@ throw Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse @-@ play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regards to adver@@ tisers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn with online advertising make money come out loud to one of the software manufacturers , adver@@ tisers to handle , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ eboard on its desktop side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it communic@@ ates that users might update their filters in the program to block further advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side was to change the co@@ ding on its advertisements , in order to detect it ob@@ struc@@ ting the identification of it , which part of the site is advertising to complic@@ ate .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that there was a new way of dealing with the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ fight has already been underway since the invention of adver@@ tisers . &quot; and , that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has released for social media in the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying display cou@@ plings for the industry have become .
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe approximately 200 million people , ad @-@ lock@@ ers , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1,@@ 03 billion daily users , who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand @-@ up 84 percent of the adver@@ tisers .
the company has made it on adver@@ tisers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad blocked has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of income from that Facebook appears to be an investment of such a step as rewarding .
on Tuesday announced Facebook with that it would be &quot; ad @-@ prize pool &quot; to update the people more control over it dispos@@ ed of advertising .
on Thursday alleged Facebook , that Ad@@ Block would be dis@@ qui@@ ap@@ ing new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertisements .
&quot; for users this represents no positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man from Facebook in an email message .
adver@@ tisers are a stupid means , which is why we instead have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people .
woman with suspected self@@ ish@@ ness on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ cide of multiple cars was transferred on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark . in an act of despair , &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss citizen in the age of 49 years , which was transferred from multiple vehicles , including a load balance , wanted to kill themselves .
it still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified yet , the police said these as well as any witnesses in the incident to log in .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter of Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
that is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where a person in the dark ran on the fre@@ eway - was decided that the mot@@ orists not to assume that a pedestrian on the middle of the night will run on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of the jo@@ ck@@ ery kill@@ ings after having over@@ ride a man and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 was placed near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the Court held that the polic@@ eman -- which had responded to an emergency , -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Ju@@ dge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once habit@@ able
Venus was probably formerly inhabit@@ able according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be set up with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ un@@ similar conditions .
scientists have previously argued that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have a thin , er@@ ased similar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly emerged .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect it from quicker ste@@ aming .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus replaces its daily page of the Sun nearly two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that previously suspected of planetary researchers .
although it was probably inhabit@@ able , Venus was exposed as much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans dil@@ uted and its water vap@@ or was burned down by ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy enters the trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Pri@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to bring it more depth and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations should be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a determin@@ ative right in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently met .
Sak@@ ic , who founded Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the winner of the League of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he brought the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado has been be@@ aten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the description listed in the 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the game for a second wild game spot in the Western Conference to return five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ ah , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal and the Aval@@ an@@ che .

strike against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of current path , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep a couple of full @-@ day sessions over the coming weeks to start the start of next year to tackle the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions have said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has shortened the R@@ ata by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure this year due to negative market pressure .
the advice of the company follows a 10 @-@ percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the enterprise gives the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to raise its oil and gas activity up to 10 countries since it is its business activities as a result of its mega re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy enterprises are on the basis of lower resource prices , under pressure , an economic situation affecting the European Union by the decision of the British in June . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliament@@ arians Dave Anderson met in early this week with workers leaders in order to discuss one of the largest labor disputes resulting from a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are spending money for new projects in North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ ing tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped the complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ adas .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster belongs to different ro@@ asts as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are met with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other constell@@ ations , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pi@@ le of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster which originated about 125 million years ago now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotary rates , these att@@ end stars encounter large amounts of observ@@ atory .
since these winds come through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation @-@ rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that massive stars revol@@ ves more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ x smaller than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ adas we see that slow rotor will tend to be massive , comfortable rot@@ ors to be very luminous stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star @-@ pi@@ le of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star @-@ pi@@ le of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ s@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , W@@ ann and why stars down their rotation rates and say about their &quot; dance Sho@@ es . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ adas , which soon will be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star begins
the tears lie at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base @-@ Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year old pro will take on August 12 against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year deal has been poss@@ essed of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the essay on 31 December 2017 , he also acts as a consultant and a youth coach - in full content .
as a player , there were a long time with power Rodri@@ gu@@ ez .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2005 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 until 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to gain some mil@@ estones .
the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays will show two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the Bas@@ mes@@ o of the Bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field was so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 the super@@ star has arrived at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have captured the stero@@ ids .
in August 2013 he was imprison@@ ed because of a re@@ traction in so @-@ called organic @-@ line sk@@ ating until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main susp@@ icious one , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time .
even his f@@ arewell days do not go far away .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again got the big stage while Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; read Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , sympathy of fans from the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the trailer in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Tar@@ inski are the first Dop@@ ing@@ es
caught : because of a positive Dop@@ ing@@ rehear@@ sal weight of Adrian G@@ inski from Poland can not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - the Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ ing@@ es .
an aw@@ k@@ ness had almost won a medal .
ahead of the seventh competition work the first official Dop@@ ing@@ es were announced the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ en@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil - directly ahead of the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions coming these messages to un@@ time .
in Ch@@ en has already been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ quer@@ ous medium for dop@@ ing@@ bat instances .
the International Sport@@ al@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to the exclusion of the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 9 seconds , they missed the bronze .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of 50 m fre@@ isti@@ l .
in the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ Test and a hearing was requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association includes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court Hotel CA@@ S and will accept the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S for the refur@@ bish@@ ment of athletes , with positive cases .
likewise , at night of Rio oo@@ ed the message over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV Chann@@ els B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is intended to act on the substance of the EP@@ O @-@ offering using blood @-@ offering EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Test should also be positive already .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov en@@ acted immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ eni@@ ans to word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians stand under review , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , about all weights from the chron@@ ically dou@@ bl@@ et@@ ric nation should not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London olymp@@ ic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ abo@@ le Ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both disp@@ uted the intake , both allowed to start not in class to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF had forbidden the complete Russian team up to an exception for systematic synthesis of the start , even the purification nation in Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
moreover , in the swimming @-@ sports , we had also taken care of the previous associations in China for fierce disputes also between the athletes .
so , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille H@@ our@@ t made the Chinese Olympi@@ ad sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to commit , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ton Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mental sc@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been positively influenced by the Chinese champion@@ ships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to un@@ lock a three @-@ month lock .
datas@@ he@@ ets : so per@@ fi@@ de presses h@@ ers your sol@@ der
programmer from Me@@ z@@ ungs @-@ Mal@@ ware directly access companies - and have been successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware armed resistance specialists at 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies were surv@@ eyed over the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with re@@ pres@@ ser software .
almost 20 per cent of companies already were the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware compres@@ s@@ ors .
40 percent of victims paid by the perpetr@@ ators demanded by the offen@@ ders to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize its earning @-@ in software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in corporate networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been successful there , the potential to be pressed is significantly higher than at private users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Programs were still designed to send advertising to advertising .
then we discovered the perpetr@@ ators of ext@@ or@@ tion software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past months quickly .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it looks targeted after un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
subsequently the software presents the demands of the black@@ smith .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
but where private users &apos; personal photo @-@ database is at stake , it is about sensitive customers data or project databases , without which the production stand still .
accordingly , the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German firms reported sales loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to interrup@@ t the business operation , in case of case people were killed in the case of life .
many times in Germany have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by losing health workers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays not , it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ eit@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data get back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time .
the h@@ acker again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers of F @-@ secure the utility surfaces and the contact with the presses are examined and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their victims via chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and will be rid of individuals after payments of a few hundreds of Euros , companies need to negotiate on hard and five digits to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risks of risk from the ran@@ som@@ ware re@@ press@@ ors the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains safety per@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
probably it is likely that it is three or four persons .
the programmers are selling their harm software then in the form of a software construction to the actual patho@@ gens .
the previous mal@@ ware kits created by providing the mal@@ ware themselves , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a adap@@ t@@ tool , so that small configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding may be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the presses are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the newly acquired software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
you log into one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a crimin@@ als and charges a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per registered computer .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ alizes then don@@ er with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
Ran@@ som@@ ware &apos;s risk is now known by many companies that ensure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can rely on file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already following new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone does not contain a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetr@@ ators instead deal with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calcul@@ c@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of Mar@@ cin K@@ eit@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case for damage , depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before .
the perpetr@@ ators will be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers as they could get an integrated thermo@@ stat on their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such an ob@@ ased heating system could indeed be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ator then rather than the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for every day
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will put everything : a little s@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V had a high HR @-@ V more small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond space , it works in no place close .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , just the cock@@ pit @-@ top is there something off .
versatile vehicle is the HR @-@ V at storage box .
it is not only a trunk @-@ room of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l under a folding back pain@@ s , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; .
this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back @-@ bank can be folded as k@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer space @-@ storage , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1.1 m high .
the luggage room is well loaded , however the charger with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peuge@@ ot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 horse@@ power speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation areas very powerful .
however , his work might be somewhat qui@@ eter .
encouraging is the everyday use of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is still another engine of engine : a 1,5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a drive drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
however , the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment is always open to the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; for any requests .
among the security systems , the City @-@ Emer@@ gency wizard ( works up to speed 32 ) , the Kol@@ l@@ isions Order and the Sp@@ ur@@ hal@@ te@@ assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kol@@ l@@ isions warned sometimes because he has been rated many obstacles at the rank of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ al@@ ising objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works from the remote wizard .
and the intelligent chis@@ el respon@@ ds to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ sters when required the speed .
however , the full connectivity is available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket lie below arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euros for the well equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 200@@ 00 euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V offers Honda a versatile and everyday @-@ everyday car .
Airline is not liable : fall on air condi@@ ments
one airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the down@@ fall of a knee br@@ ush@@ an .
but the accident could have been happening everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no harm to the man .
disease : when paid the organis@@ er
the holi@@ day@@ makers will only get money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is beyond doubt to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests are proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case there was a family on the second day of their Turkish Empire , heavy to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
they spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
your disorder resulted in the vac@@ ation@@ ers on a def@@ ective Kl@@ ä@@ pper that supposedly did the se@@ a@@ water dirty .
the family was the view , the trip had been faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
although the cl@@ a@@ al situation was in fact broken .
but the organis@@ er was just shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
so he did not hurt his information duties , so that judgment .
especially since in the rehear@@ sals of the water no im@@ pur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly even by infection with each other - belong to the general life risk .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the fallen out of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried before further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must have had and determined to react to terror at the same time .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph will not get the terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the perpetr@@ ators need to leave faster the country , they increase the safety and increase of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals by the election of 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal rein@@ forcement of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in middle scale , more than several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be subject to punishment again .
video surveillance is to be improved , the weapon @-@ law is to be trac@@ ed as a way , that above all the purchase of weapons has been created on the internet .
the last much discussed per@@ plex@@ es for physicians should be uph@@ eld after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the poorest of the doctors , how the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of some psych@@ ic symptoms .
in order to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social support for it necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared to deal with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
in the pursuit of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to deplo@@ y the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Interior concerning action must be clear against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ min@@ ed for the Shar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ eng@@ upe ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ ves from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected .
a generi@@ c prohibition of the full @-@ fixing may be problematic for un@@ constitutional .
you can not for@@ bid it all you are re@@ jects , and I multip@@ ly the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witness against trial .
green boss in Simone Peter conquered the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ ck@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the residence to the right bring the people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic of traffic on the motorway
there is a regular look at the orbit - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : the rule of law is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who stand in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the provincial road extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the departure Wes@@ eler road to 700 meters .
mot@@ orists can then fly directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will be con@@ current , allowing the total to be improved on the multi@@ faceted section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driving distance on the Zu@@ br@@ inger dri@@ es the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ven@@ e trail and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here the traffic can be reached only via the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be rec@@ ated quite a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations gi@@ vers that the bridge does not have the required capacity , in order to hal@@ low primarily the heavy load of goods .
as long as these bott@@ len@@ ders and the associated traffic @-@ traffic jam will last , the responsible state business can not say .
however , it is to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official recovery period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal situation , the provincial business was conscious of the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be past on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural trip : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a musical project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an introduction of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students from eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the Less@@ er House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year the association , the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has set the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes , the possibility of visiting this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people were between September 2015 and March 2016 , amongst others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and have little German .
thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ zen@@ ische images and vide@@ anim@@ ations , it was possible to follow the course , so the press release of the Young Theatre in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg , from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical the@@ ater@@ ally project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 have been given the opportunity to visit professional instru@@ cted courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal voice rental are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; goes on .
given the raised refugee figures , the association anticip@@ ates many classes that wish to participate .
rain instead of star @-@ snow : hope of weather @-@ repair
the weather has made the ast@@ er@@ u@@ ppen fighter in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night on Friday a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain for it , the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night on Saturday .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one gets eternal around , at night one is very busy , in the morning it is already far before the w@@ att@@ ach@@ ers no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
nevertheless , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , board member of the German Society for dormitory research and dormitory .
what one understands it , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and sle@@ ep@@ y .
especially that sleeping many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member in the German Medical Association , with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the sleep @-@ interference @-@ expression of another illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often seen in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ather@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors are har@@ ness@@ ed each other .
who for example has a band@@ tory case , can lie bad , watches all two to three hours and begins for wom@@ ens to talk about everyday problems and worry , gives vast@@ ly an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you talk to your doctor &apos;s doctor ?
if over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and in the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment may be quite different : one is de@@ pressed , we@@ ary , in@@ significant , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood oscill@@ ations or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep @-@ stor@@ ming , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behaviour changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - in@@ question .
precip@@ itation , in Germany , there are hardly anything , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary , medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should ask for sleep problems first to the car@@ p@@ sy , We@@ ar We@@ ar .
the one can clarify with studies if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the dormitory , and what happens ?
for the investigation in the sleeping laboratory medical research , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory resistance , at disease @-@ ti@@ ring or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ on@@ gs .
on the test you don &apos;t really have to prepare for the test .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not do a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ on@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the bon@@ ding one goes to his normal time into the bed .
in addition to the electrodes at the body , one carries a nose she@@ ath , a chest strap and a tor@@ ler at the finger .
it also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get a grip on the problem ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which you can put for a better sleep .
We@@ ather@@ oma counts : regular sleeping room and bed@@ time , not too long in bed lie , in the day not sleeping , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then you start immediately at ease , and this is totally and not in@@ appro@@ achable .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed herself via Facebook for the dis@@ closing cut of the DS@@ V @-@ Team with Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took the first gold at the World Championships in Doha for the first time , and at the same time presented his first puppy record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler available via Facebook are presented in front of his previous ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic competi@@ tor is awarded a € 20,000 prize and a jun@@ k 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his facebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sports is bad , the Dop@@ ing@@ Contro@@ ls is however very good .
with this we can not compete with countries who do so much and do not feel so closely in the topic of intelligence , or do it even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is the same way that we should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain period before the World Cup / OS from independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers in the W@@ ada / F@@ ina may not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the election of Hamburg , who now operates an ice cream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of luggage depart@@ ing arrest
professional trains at Düsseldorf Airport
in Thursday , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ar had been committed to a Ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ al@@ - and luggage ste@@ els .
against 21.@@ 30 pm , civilian officials in the area of the Airport Düsseldorf came back a gang that was known to the polic@@ eman from the past theft of the theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences in the middle of July this year and were collabor@@ ated , highly professionally and particularly professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ tic Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can have the thi@@ eves , who came to Germany for the benefit of crimes of crimes after Germany , four acts .
they had a total of about 15@@ ,000 Euro had been exploited .
old built houses , a few lime @-@ houses , with a few lime @-@ pav@@ ements : the ri@@ ver@@ ge street in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in works at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
one goes along the road from east to west , one comes along playing places , a fresh@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray home someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
to be demol@@ ished from a li@@ d@@ l which will soon be demol@@ ished , will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created .
article on this &quot; tren@@ dies@@ t district , &quot; as the official property company of Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in is preferred in the last weeks however preferred with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rent@@ al@@ ted , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin interior H@@ enk@@ el has expressed itself several times in the police against the project since the beginning of the year , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor were cleared together with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , shut up parts of the road and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Chamber of Directors agreed that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later they went to police and the builders under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talking vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main number of many inhabitants : Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the pine since 1999 and Jan@@ a * , which here three children are magni@@ fied above all from the police ence .
with the inhabitants of their own projects they share the concern of rising Mi@@ ets and v@@ entri@@ cular .
it does not sound to a pine that could be used mostly against v@@ and@@ ali@@ er left before v@@ and@@ ali@@ er left .
the mo@@ at , that of the Berlin interior and the police between the owners and their neighbors , does not appear so obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in to the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor district which , even today , compared to the rest of the city has a lowest average life and high poverty risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also house@@ locations and the consequ@@ ential residential projects have been a long time to the pine : in 1990 a number of houses have been occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer road very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had cleared up with great police officers in a regular road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig and are still inhabited by people today who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the city has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ net for tourists and elec@@ tive liner from all over the world : the inhabitants of GDR @-@ Bas@@ ed and former households are now sharing their p@@ ines .
this also makes itself noticeable in the mi@@ tig@@ ers that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on the s@@ worn discs or freshly made fac@@ ades which have been rejected with color @-@ exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ aut@@ on@@ ous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem , be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of crimes can be damaged , which are bi@@ ased about new buildings and newly renovated homes .
for Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in an apartment house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which were certainly not meant .
also the famous fl@@ amm@@ ates cars give it no longer directly in the rig .
for the studied architec@@ tin , her street is not a crime focal point , on the contrary . &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ aer Straße - and stayed .
therefore it was also so important that inhabitants get their street back : from the police , politics and the media which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of vill@@ agers , such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to face @-@ up new buildings in the former building pieces , which thr@@ ashed the old inhabitants .
&quot; they are ultimately Con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well be@@ u@@ ated , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
for the zo@@ diac , Ker@@ sti@@ n Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the j@@ p@@ ines .
who goes , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub that can complain bad about noise .
all persons named only with the first names are asked to be named not with their right names .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact for integration and organizer .
furthermore she is a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group , refugees , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else is mis@@ guided .
Reg@@ ine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are now grateful that Deu@@ ter@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Wol@@ l@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which primarily has a problem .
for example , some - less pointed than rather pointed out to the multitude of desired areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the spot .
looking for was a management expert with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just a busy wool @-@ continu@@ ance .
yet administration is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is an organisation , work with local people on site and behind the scenes as well as networks .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for about six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le volunteers and full @-@ time actors support .
there are large and minor problems , organizational , human and insur@@ g@@ ative problems .
soon there are new containers in the washing @-@ road
a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
for the connection of connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you must place the refugees in their own or rented spaces .
the cost of building , rent or restoration of these accommodations will have to carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the municipal office to the Commune and job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for quite some time .
de facto the administration takes no private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far so far , be dependent on private apartments , so deu@@ x .
therefore , common apartments must be viewed as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the washing @-@ road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agreed .
in addition to a fixed bas@@ kets , there are plac@@ ements , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and pay@@ outs for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ am@@ ming or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help domestic master , carry out charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity means not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say deu@@ ce and customer .
people would need to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so we need offers such as sports , contacts with local locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rough .
so here management and volunteers are also jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain the refugees that it just takes and it makes the time useful to bridge , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach nobody , thir@@ st not work and be useless , I will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
there are also problems , however , customers say honest , &quot; people where nothing is going on . &quot; the work of deu@@ x and customers should therefore always mo@@ tivate others to mo@@ tivate others .
all this is already a &quot; m@@ amm@@ able task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two come about fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customers clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what might call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it would not want to exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensitive are the hel@@ pers already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ inations bring them completely to call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , major and honorary staff must be held on site and in the region to activities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are always in the background that soon a new cle@@ at could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question is clear to answer , shy away from politics .
actually , it is unfair to face them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already logged in with so far to integrate the previous human beings .
this is currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are agreed .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : night@@ rac@@ er with helicopter
the police helicopter flew around one hour for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are sw@@ amped on Friday morning against 8 : 50 p.m. and penet@@ rated into an apartment in an apartment house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and hit the cl@@ ums@@ y into the escape .
the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ king , bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black chap@@ er@@ powder .
you are fle@@ dged towards the inner city .
in the case of the police , the police made a lot of gri@@ pping @-@ gather@@ ings as well as a police helicopter .
the ins@@ cription was without success .
perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell close to the flat or on their escape .
