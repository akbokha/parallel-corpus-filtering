<seg id="28">What trump do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage, he says he cannot be changed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external parties"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands a official end of the eight month long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg, I cannot give me the expression that Ankara wants to put this reconciliation in most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile acting narroig and it was barely heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand said repeatedly from his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report full of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also argued that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis but can even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day he described a newspaper that Erdogan would have heard so heard would never be anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin dured, sustainable cooled showed that Russia's head of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downcast of a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time has been walled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara, Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes will reconstruct again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the nationally controlled media brought a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed that the Turks would carry for everything the blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the most serious accusations of senior officials, Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil-trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message opted that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting was held only because Putin from the President Erdogan received the excuse which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all friends who he can get after the last month was at a written coup d "état almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are taken up again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state-based on fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agriculture imports to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West because it's reaction to the tried and tested power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued Groll comes with the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the enpike to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara won the Russian state by paying a bonus that he called for the coup d'etat support for the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "this is well-evident for Moscow and it is a matter of course that itself has a deeper fear of regiment." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glittering palace by the sea made it possible to represent Russia and Turkey, one, as it seemed to me an analysts, "alliance of external sides": two countries, which expelled from the West and are poorly treated and are now built.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest differentiation is Syria, where Moscow has recently given itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support antagonistic sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of first talk both presidents on the press conference said they didn't even attack the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey has seen it intentionally to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of an open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than the NATO member of Turkey, it is certainly better that the two heads of state are at least again talk to each other.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian president Vladimir Putin has released unexpectedly its staff reef Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged a statement of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a substitute since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 was born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated at the renowned State Department of Moscow for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (in Russian) that he later was a protocol and the administrative manager of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin," "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of affairs with regard to legislative measures and inspections to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked for his post to leave and Vaino recommended as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the most ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has turned Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidence Vladimir Putin and works as he stands for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men asserted that the staff should return on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, here are just a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but the official statement - that a man who was once called a potential President once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead to great scepticism." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov" "" "it is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining about four years." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Minister of Minister and Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Council KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council (FSB), who created the KGB, Ivanov was named in his deputy leader.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin spoke to power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could be President of Russia for Putin's second term as a third term Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, closest ally to Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for fit the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge load on their place and the last section of Decks gets today in Rosyth a betongated for the deck, which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>

<seg id="5">Yet disputes is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who is supposed to build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A provision is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD's presidents of Christoph Bratmann says: "we are with the Greens agree: who wants to build on urban areas in future must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing program, which will cost millions and needs to be financed, is intended to ensure incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as viola:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few requirements as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is not requesting harshness for investors.</seg>

<seg id="17">When the concept of action is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program is not yet entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built in any case.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of further approximately 1300 cheap apartments whose promotion will continue in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments up to 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the budgetary spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, it would have to be expected to take apartments back into the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On one fell swoop, the problem can solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city the dates are running out for the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the Weststadt is again dramatically increased, one is removed from the aim of so-called intermingling.</seg>
<seg id="31">There will be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck, which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenage children and child are no longer going out for playing outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time on monitors on screens, was laments in the last decade of many laments.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were based on the characters, first created for the video games in the 1990s (later emerged from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena in the population, the interest in front of the play of the game declined in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the server overload.</seg>
<seg id="10">In less days Pokémon Go more users than ink and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS as soon as they were found once, "photographed (over a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. "</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and sprang out for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the United States the game led to a considerable rise in steps which sets the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which repersecuted 35.000 users, told that within two days after market launch of the game, the number of traced people coming every day, 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who of which Pokémon Go plays - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "to be active" "" "and" "" "every day actively, because many public messages are boring to health and get rid of people who look like this." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who drives regularly sports reduces his chances of diseased in cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also dreaming game-shutter, which must always be complaining about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk around a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps as Fitbit could retrace our activity before, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons success there will be more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activist will be united in the real world and helping many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabi and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present myself among the women's Olympic Games and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been during every summer season since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Hernandez, which inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin ist and Madison Kocian, the Catholics is every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female gymnast an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games - Gabi Douglas a surprising Olympic Games and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to be witness of the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as they predicted, but the most prominent gymastics supplied.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, which won an individual multi-fight event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but do not see turnclasses throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabi and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Lended Five" because the next Olympiad is only four gymnasts in the crew. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that gymnast a costlier Sport is and gymnast first and foremost in private trainers who will be maintained by parents who will pay for the training, interior, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turers and families). the list can be continued as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these associations, the turner received its entire training and that is for families a long-term and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes, since they started with the turfs.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired to the municipalities aun countless, young girls, which are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a high-performance and easier access turncrement.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnout of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) offered national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, which thousands of young girls bring to interest for the gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabi and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the olympic team gold language and thank you, Fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The moderator and Travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk threw its course on a euro Schein, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a sinbutt of a drawingette and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leaning of each object he used a Luminometer for himself and to show us what it is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment performed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stinth" brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>

<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with physicians and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, what he lecked out, more than a bad taste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and he ate unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to sink of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms, and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was in any case justified.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="15">Compared to that, the Luminometry number is made of fresh hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian restroom, which he refused to deviate, after their Luminometry more than 4000 units was, while fresh hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validate produced the travel trade "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Stupth," which shows the total number of different locations like the bathroom</seg>

<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vukovmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the Director of the film, added: "let me tell me so - I had made my respect for Ian, when he had noticed some of the things I have instructed him to lick, just like the ekelist Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we received some of these dirty goodies on film. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel cars as the export-off world-wide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the recall campaign there is a vortex around a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen starts to discharge the shippers in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Europe's largest passports can continue in the course of the year despite the diesel standards thanks to its many brands and some well-moving markets further than a plus.</seg>

<seg id="8">The VW brand has sold 40 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars worldwide than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales grew 14 percent below the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany sacked the supplies of almost a six-sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Branding head Jürgen Stackmann led the weakest figures from July primarily at two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it was given a sales agreement in some core markets with "changed economic framework."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote said to the resignation from the EU, explained a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust gas is first escalated, there is also further a minus to beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the main affected households of the Lower Saxony can already be crossed by the diesel andal: after the first seven months only one supplier minus from 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles is at beech.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group leader Fred Kappler was further developing a sales office from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with software testing.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling for approximately 2.5 million cars for retrofitting to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting, VW, that the alteration of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting of the vehicles it has no deterioration of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The bus station transfers the customer after retrofitting a "guaranteed" certificate, but do not speak of a "warranty" as it meant on Friday in a company.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason are legal enocracies.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen affords his German customers now a guarantee for retrofitting diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed this for the last Monday VW Representative of the BundesTransport Department.</seg>
<seg id="27">From the Ministry of Transport, this meeting was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has completely fulfilled the conditions of my inquiry Commission and the KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"any deviations from it will not be accepted," stated Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor outputs after refurbishment, no deteriorations can be held and all deapproved vehicle values are retained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen himself uses the term "warranty" but not as it was in a company.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen guarantees that customers for example will come half a year after retrofitting approximately with a motor impact in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software too, even if the damage it has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the customer interest, it is important to avoid that in any case of any other damage that nothing has to do with the exhaust bud, it comes to an offence with regard to possible guarantees of warranty as it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who does not buy soundplates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged men love hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to a comment, to oversee him under the alias of non-avenue men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the revealing redevelopment of sound plates is not due to a boom in millennials that want to embrace the news of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all the forecasts according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Kismic group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older platters disretain their feelings sooner (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend their alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But how are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble servant and wild stricken before I resale my hands and something determinant like: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos was slow in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located, there are still a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman, to switch the camera out for the next part, in which I stand at close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and vegetables through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I went by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) to Recordess Records (data number: eight men middle aged man, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," says he.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 bikers.</seg>
<seg id="17">This soundproofing, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not responded to it home), suffer the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a substantial number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy sheets, which he could not afford to buy when they were released and again objects, which he sold when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I have probably had something to young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy sheets are more introverted and like to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, which works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on the Yougov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who will have influenced by the medial, people who have heard about comeback and led themselves to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually have hardened their collection to 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves back their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age point.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like phonica, to recognize that record stores provide a soothing community of equine-minded community.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the elderly customers took the contact to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of confidential sound stress, from objects, the blissful chedermen.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material proprietors as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's like a collector for me and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "soldering a member of one of the plate." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not yet ended.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey was also found out that 41% have a record player, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I was blunt through a stack of wicksa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, which works in the sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged) has noticed a "Trophy" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I have no record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record plate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely going.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-free.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly coming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Mucks that has devoted to the soundproofing is almost a whole floor, has a blower crowd when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, teenagers and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the most popular shops - Wild Beast New thesizers and sexnified pop instead of experimental jazz drans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks quite lonely, but naecological traumata are difficult to assert, if one stands beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the boards available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-heredium as a large-box.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates do not have a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or another way but the beauty of records is... "they drive with a loving sighs.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it truly is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store by which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I indicate the semblance of jeans Hotpants to patterns, observe a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and daughter are superior to buy a crosley disk player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks like them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money to the industry and some buyers in the depths of Sohos for more could be sent, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records, who exist in reality, records business and in online activity.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are likely to work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bumbleing through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steered the starred view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, which rises over the shoulders of an intermediate aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French Court rejected a proposal of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle from Calais to live in the thousands of refugees living in Calais.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of trial proceedings, the authorities argue that the state should be authorised to buy 72 provisional shops, in which individuals within the camp goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hair-dressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants sell.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be lower, because they would pose a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid, and that a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the public and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals to people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional shops, but admits that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable.</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feed people who live in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers can offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the Netherlands was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des camp, which will be operated non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on Asylum in the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the finale on Thursday evening at a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten up with a result of 43-7 in the degenerative stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has created a master class in the handling, side-stepping, descend, scheduled run and rotating power to win gold - their first Olympiad of all color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was misled by the non-poor Trophy of the Silver medal - Great Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could be dropped to them in the finale.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, Fiji could have taken a 15-man team in stock.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a Trost for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite morning a gold medal will hang around his neck, Fijis Principle Ben Ryan, the former Chief of England in Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost in Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slots will blow job, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculous and let the attacks GBs out of fun abprone.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at, as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, as Oocean Kolinisau in the corner stirring.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai made another attack on the right corner which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely placed the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A thirsty titute from Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but it just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute of Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the Reanpfiff and there was still over a minute of playing... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou preset through another slight tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still permitted to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes during the half-time period and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant incident of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched a trial for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of the South-slanders, whose fans sang, flags and danced at the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plumage, the Fijis embraced himself and GB kicked her crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day Fiji Japan had conquered Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and the United Kingdom pushed South Africa in a scarcely half-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tacer by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-member teams, secured the gain - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinal gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which into history go down, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who sat at the rod, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was alpresent as she came to the second Olympiagold in two without a tax result, the first women in the history of British sports that laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.empowered bet, which is likewise exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that glides over the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not the type of triumphal geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the Ruhr there is a battalion to oblige and contribute to the incremental progress that make up the difference and there was nobody an assistant than the trainer who would survive 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">How he said he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bubbles, who is operied and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather fine situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he may be treating early 2014, outside the season, could start making the break up a minimum if this is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so it had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing of itself is already a challenge, but this makes it one more larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the incurability of the Victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-provoking morning and tried to talk more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, which was the captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would have no one, so is a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have a better person for exercising or wishing to better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose race during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents were not able to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark concluded, Stanning and Glover had too much to reserve.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied her entire life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the course of teaching, she took the subject of music and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," describes it.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample it feels balanced, cheerful and a total of more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are very good in doing so doing their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is right from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to regular meetings, seniors can make social contacts and foster.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often, social and family structures exist at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir:" "" "speak and organising themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being" "" "being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand his lungs regularly demands, but also in everyday life not as fast as puffed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour community of the senior organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common bond had a much higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people arouses many memories often linked to positive emotions of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, he denied themselves denied events for long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">With singing, the head is also claimed a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on one's voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other senses - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone, practise themselves not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the acknowledgment that one learns through the singing in the choir, means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: when I look for something long, I will better and alert beyond me - this experience reinforces us.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means, little talent, betrays Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't forget that alone - at 50 Sinigo people, who listens to when a tone goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the suitable offer have seniors different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone out of the acquaintances in a Senorenchor, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senorenchantages can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the internet may ask the family, friends or neighbours around the internet request.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who desire has to sing, should join a choir avenger Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something freeing - this is true of any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsurgency to the races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With his filter tool, it makes snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already as absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are undetected, standalone tools that generate more than 30 million improved Selfters per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistours get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have moved criticism in the past that they have been accused that the app of Blackface-shaped or white skin would be a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week presented a filter to some users, who gave them slucent, false teeth and enraped cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow sighted."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy surrendered to a larger problem that the company with diversity has.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation have been widely spread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and motherboard, one day after Snapchat told that it would have disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse. the filter was meant as homage to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, the pedimatism experienced, reminded of the filter of hurtful stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Other refrained the Anime-comparison decidedly.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, that the filter was hurtful and doomed to be unpleasant. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the counterparts of a very conflicting Asian cartoon and the filter-effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not bted, but that the yellow-sighted was dragged into the recalling extremes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are disilly in terms of race than their older counterparty - could be more likely to expect to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filter is a picture that is insulting, "it is much harder that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier the case," said the 25-year Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu decided who works as a Product-manager and Ingenieurin for Medium, her Snapchat account to extinguish others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on media and in a phone interview, she said that they think that racted controversy is a lack of diversity among the management practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the big part white, just male leadership and ended their attachment with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin-colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to tell what about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it refused Snapchat, the cultural backgrounds of its staff to discuss, but according to a spokesperson the company recently set up a personnel responsible who focused on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said in turn, that she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not ok."</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain stands before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match against India that won the Americans with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said, she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the winter competition and are still alive in their group with the Britons in the first place that remains unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which both of the two teams will get from the first and second place in their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first platinum will go slightly longer from the road that the other group will attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places in the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey club in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the founder of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympiad in 2008, since it could not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came, in which for her and her team all went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, a Englishman, Trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn the things for better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workings around in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rod can be carried out completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bat opened the gate in the first half of the game with a backlash from the seam.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and kept the game of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam played the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She carried a Sprint with a flat ball over the left side, moved into the middle and took the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goguardian of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which had previously had a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will hinge will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are growing and inescapable of putting a rapid reless between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is framed by the wristwatch to swimmers to the tripod to the tripod.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen when talking your neighbors in the queue in the Coffeehop menu without using Simone Biles, Katie Leyy or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos to hear.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are logon Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's too warm with dimples would definitely have been sent to this known name that would be sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, when he would be a swimmer, gymnasts or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights during the winter trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not show any event immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always float the pectoral and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might want to make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline, has been a olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was noted the last 16 years so many that I had asked, did not know that there is at all a olympic name.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US pleaded a competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and until 2012 had made a athletes who made it up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians to share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain external rock-charme, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownum school as the one that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoant trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports that it is essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard.</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moves (rotating, yeast and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to official Olympiaprob after execution, difficulty and 'flight time. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-one athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are intertwined in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions need to continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output, but in the televisions also another cavity: that of the world or the olympic index.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatics - and it is enough to stir even a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find themselves when watching this games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces from, apparently heelos like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortless again upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, not vaults in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification round and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is shown the dubids as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked compared to the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the appreciation of consciousness can only be achieved through the attendant and the lens of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently, Mr Dooley expects his air rinse, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia, to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig demonstrators were killed during the clashes with the police in walnut.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to crack together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid allies of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months, protest against the government began to strike the country and spread more and more into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave up that policemen were shot on zig unarmed protesters and slew.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moving the videos over the protests, probably from the last or early this year, show how security people hit young people with shocks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a incoming inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep up this country and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services collaborate closely with the Ethiopians, in order to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expansionary at the respectable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new move in the capital of Addis Abeba." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia has been anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, the dissidents were effective for silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or to the prison, or were driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopies.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth is protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the spice attack in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this zag, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced by the turbulence over the last few years, and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitter after years of suffering from the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians had been able to communicate via social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government keeps access to Facebook and Twitter, which at regular intervals, does many people still communicate about Internet proxies who hide from where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "several young Ethiopians gave them that they were so much" "" "protracted" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons prosperized the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia, mostly Christian-countries, in politics and economics, while they are the Oromos exploded, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is not changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on an unpublicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in it to perceive early indications of dissatisfaction and special officers to use opponents and to make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic principle," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict-analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian New prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected from relatively unsighted grounds in order to assume the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region NordäEthiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services monitored by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia has experienced such a turmoil, after thousands of protest protesters, according to information from analyst, apparently circulated by the government and subsequently stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest was relatively fast past.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts - Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as the new pendent move, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal dismissal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month attacked protesters in Gondar, a amharian city, run by Tigray-guided shops and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming ever more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests of the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently rushed out that she closed this base." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West will clearly support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his Claim Obama founded ISIS. "Sarkasmus" had been</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surround his campaign by demonstrating that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton had been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not the serious meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying statement defines new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presidential data of the Republican, whether he will be able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his collaborators who seek to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the peculiar position, statements that he might not be meant to have.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election contest on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump had returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he is just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump was in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken this statement by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the Republican presidential race would not know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the crimp down on Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling revenues on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Over Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead suggestions to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought to his defense in Sarkasmus.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he attracted strong criticisms, when he meant, the Russians should hacking Mrs. Clintons emails, but explained later "naturally, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then shrink if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be added as they arrive, and then appropriate," depending on how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication team that observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of making the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more estimony so that its fractures have further declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he accused his critics often to distort his statements or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherzites have brought his loyal co-terrorism into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercedes, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backbone, completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government was served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor ministerin, it allowed to spread themselves to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the electoral events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and bowed them before, on each of his words, and to be biased towards him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he poisoned the" poor "" poor "television expert, who try to understand him and said," "" "You cannot!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats endorsed by Mr. Trumps's excuse for a further proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after its climb to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">The gourmets had President Roosevelt, a faible for ingenious delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The menu on this day was a bit modest: cored eggs in tomato sauce, potato harbree and as dessert a Pflaumenpudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman told in their book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, snowshoe Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which is already in the store since the stock crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheeses with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato harbree and vegetable-mixing.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter Hackbraten ordered it, this found the pair in a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was Erdwalnut, liver and Bohnenbrot.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was placed in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiled for male enhancement workers and it was served fresh baked pastures for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "there were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War." "" "A Square" "" "records the ways on which the country turned out to be no more the larsapland." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was for years the centre of the American cuisine has become a rare luxury.</seg>

<seg id="32">As never before or since, exaggerated household income - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943, the eating habits of the Land of such.</seg>
<seg id="33">By published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become an "household policy" and to transform the challenge of transforming them as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "A Square meal" "" "is a festival of historic leaks." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer in his kitchen, he speiste as the millionth man of the world, which he has become.</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in a nearly contaminated dining room and carried out a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightful retraction.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt had perhaps committed the same mistake when not his wife Eleanor had called him to statute him with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruited of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt took that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, has been rejected as soon as the country came back on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave themselves better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Ziegelman's in-law better understood - for example, as they couldn't throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"it had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.</seg>

<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a nasty trick, humble recipes had a real name to miss.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each dipped slightly reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazing enough, it is not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest fluff is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland mostly only appear in winter to surface finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims up a 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Considerably, the Greenland shark along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is on average just 1.220 feet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of long-loneliness of life seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal Science "at least from a Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuing in the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this span, which means for vertebrates a World Record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist employed already for a long time, that Greenland is a stone-stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyles of Greenland, researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pentempt measures it, when they plainted six animals in front of the spider six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a seal, another had taken the jaw of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly chase them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice and look for Kadaver that from higher water layers based on torangles.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as a catch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was about 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimeter.</seg>
<seg id="22">To investigate the age of animals, they analysed with the carbon-14-method of the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the ophthalmology has been created before the birth of the sharks, the contained proteins are later no longer redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a strikingly high carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons, attempts to cut greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the case of 220 centimetres length of the third animal, the lens holder has a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens with which the cosmic rays can be created in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimetres long Greenland shark a age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length could be assigned an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are likely to be on the threshold of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland can be obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">It may also be the case for vertebrates currently in the world.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusal eme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in its bacon on the neck a 120 year old resin-tip, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures it often runs the organism of the animals living there on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slowly slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume increases much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram is therefore much greater than that of a gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should tend to invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="5">And we will accomplish this again by creating new opportunities for local, and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will have already 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement hathrows is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have said that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will blamate on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wrongly set wrong and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was probably formerly inhabitable according to projections of a new NASA climate.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by using tools and algorithms that resemble climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be set up with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once erunsimilar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously argued that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have a thin, erased similar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly emerged.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from quicker steaming.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent Matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus replaces its daily page of the Sun nearly two months," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds, which affects the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that previously suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed as much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans diluted and its water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datasheets: so perfide presses hers your solder</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer from Mezungs-Malware directly access companies - and have been successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware armed resistance specialists at 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were surveyed over the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of an attack with represser software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Almost 20 per cent of companies already were the target of a ransomware compressors.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the offenders to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize its earning-in software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "they have been successful there, the potential to be pressed is significantly higher than at private users." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," "" "explains Malwarebytes of Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">2008 most MalwarePrograms were still designed to send advertising to advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrators of extortion software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacking took place in the past months quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it looks targeted after unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of the blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of the Cryptowing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users' personal photo-database is at stake, it is about sensitive customers data or project databases, without which the production stand still.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German firms reported sales loss by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business operation, in case of case people were killed in the case of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many times in Germany have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by losing health workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays not, it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Keitzynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, their data get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of downtime.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers of F-secure the utility surfaces and the contact with the presses are examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their victims via chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access support websites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be rid of individuals after payments of a few hundreds of Euros, companies need to negotiate on hard and five digits to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risks of risk from the ransomware repressors the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains safety perniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probably it is likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers are selling their harm software then in the form of a software construction to the actual pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits created by providing the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a adapttool, so that small configurations, appearance and branding may be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for further hackers in order to spread the newly acquired software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">You log into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminals and charges a further way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per registered computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminalizes then doner with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ransomware's risk is now known by many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can rely on file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone does not contain a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators instead deal with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculcations," "" "says Malwarebytes of Marcin Keitzynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the case for damage, depending on the type of data still a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get an integrated thermostat on their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such an obased heating system could indeed be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then rather than the heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the HR-V had a high HR-V more small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the Fond space, it works in no place close.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI socket lie below armrest and therefore are somewhat awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 Euros for the well equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets eternal around, at night one is very busy, in the morning it is already far before the wattachers no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wear, board member of the German Society for dormitory research and dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands it, but is the Insomnie, so an input and sleepy.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially that sleeping many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German Medical Association, with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep-interference-expression of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often seen in depression," "" "says Weatheroma." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are harnessed each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a bandtory case, can lie bad, watches all two to three hours and begins for womens to talk about everyday problems and worry, gives vastly an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you talk to your doctor's doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If over a period of one month in at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and in the day is compromised, should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may be quite different: one is depressed, weary, insignificant, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood oscillations or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep-storming, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things, behaviour changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at the most for two weeks - inquestion.</seg>
<seg id="22">Precipitation, in Germany, there are hardly anything, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary, medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should ask for sleep problems first to the carpsy, Wear Wear.</seg>
<seg id="24">The one can clarify with studies if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the dormitory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the investigation in the sleeping laboratory medical research, for example with snoring with respiratory resistance, at disease-tiring or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fiongs.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the test you don't really have to prepare for the test.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not do a nap," "" "says Fionetze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the bonding one goes to his normal time into the bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes at the body, one carries a nose sheath, a chest strap and a torler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a grip on the problem?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which you can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weatheroma counts: regular sleeping room and bedtime, not too long in bed lie, in the day not sleeping, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night don't look at the clock - then you start immediately at ease, and this is totally and not inapproachable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old built houses, a few lime-houses, with a few lime-pavements: the riverge street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">One goes along the road from east to west, one comes along playing places, a freshed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray home someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be demolished from a lidl which will soon be demolished, will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on this "trendiest district," as the official property company of Friedrichshain is preferred in the last weeks however preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rentalted, on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin interior Henkel has expressed itself several times in the police against the project since the beginning of the year, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor were cleared together with 300 police officers, patrolled the police three weeks of official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, shut up parts of the road and held visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Chamber of Directors agreed that the clearance was illegal, and a day later they went to police and the builders under the cheers of sympathizers and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talking vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main number of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the pine since 1999 and Jana *, which here three children are magnified above all from the police ence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of their own projects they share the concern of rising Miets and ventricular.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound to a pine that could be used mostly against vandalier left before vandalier left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The moat, that of the Berlin interior and the police between the owners and their neighbors, does not appear so obvious.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Friedrichshain to the east of Berlin was actually a traditional labor district which, even today, compared to the rest of the city has a lowest average life and high poverty risk." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houselocations and the consequential residential projects have been a long time to the pine: in 1990 a number of houses have been occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer road very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had cleared up with great police officers in a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the rig and are still inhabited by people today who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the city has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and elective liner from all over the world: the inhabitants of GDR-Based and former households are now sharing their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes itself noticeable in the mitigers that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the rig are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them on the sworn discs or freshly made facades which have been rejected with color-exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often with the words" "" "linksautonous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem, be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of crimes can be damaged, which are biased about new buildings and newly renovated homes.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in an apartment house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were certainly not meant.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous flammates cars give it no longer directly in the rig.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architectin, her street is not a crime focal point, on the contrary. "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important that inhabitants get their street back: from the police, politics and the media which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of villagers, such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: due to face-up new buildings in the former building pieces, which thrashed the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"they are ultimately Condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well beuated," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the zodiac, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house-projects and the left scene belonged to the jpines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who goes, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub that can complain bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons named only with the first names are asked to be named not with their right names.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore she is a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of administration at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group, refugees, administrations, authorities and who else is misguided.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are now grateful that Deuterle is now there, the eiving Wollmilchsau, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, some - less pointed than rather pointed out to the multitude of desired areas - meant as the administration wanted to write the spot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for was a management expert with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just a busy wool-continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administration is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is an organisation, work with local people on site and behind the scenes as well as networks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle volunteers and full-time actors support.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and minor problems, organizational, human and insurgative problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing-road</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection of connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in their own or rented spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or restoration of these accommodations will have to carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the municipal office to the Commune and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration takes no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far so far, be dependent on private apartments, so deux.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be viewed as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the washing-road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keywords, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agreed.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed baskets, there are placements, training courses, one-euro jobs and payouts for refugees and migrants who need to be undamming or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help domestic master, carry out charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity means not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say deuce and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would need to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers such as sports, contacts with local locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rough.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here management and volunteers are also jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain the refugees that it just takes and it makes the time useful to bridge, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Urbach nobody, thirst not work and be useless, I will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also problems, however, customers say honest, "people where nothing is going on." the work of deux and customers should therefore always motivate others to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammable task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two come about fear of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" no, "" "" no, "" "" says Regine customers clearly, "" "" what might call naive. "" "" but it would not want to exclude it. "" "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitive are the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassinations bring them completely to call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "so, major and honorary staff must be held on site and in the region to activities" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new cleat could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer, shy away from politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to face them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is already logged in with so far to integrate the previous human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women are agreed.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
