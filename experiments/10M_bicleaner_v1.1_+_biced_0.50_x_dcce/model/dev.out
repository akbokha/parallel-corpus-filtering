Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about the dest@@ abili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when meeting it , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington def@@ aul@@ ted the continuing sett@@ ler building of Israel and casts off a lack of confidence in the peace process .
through the deal of Obama &apos;s wor@@ eas@@ ed deal about the Iranian nuclear programme the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March Netanyahu at the invitation of the Republi@@ can held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress which was partially regarded as Aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in one call , Professor , his girlfriend went to have shot
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon was talking about a multi @-@ e@@ ous voice of the police , he made his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his home .
he was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was yet alive and probably been excited , and he said , the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials took the suffering of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to do it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by him .
there was no indication that he travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who had already traveled 300 miles to school grounds , where he finds a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot and killed at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 AM .
he said he has made the fatal emergency , sometime soon .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police captured him .
spending a day after the s@@ late at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators in both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who explained him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pro@@ found@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned he in a written book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they teach students at the Department of Social Sciences and History whose teacher has 17 members , and many students attended classes of both .
at the same time there were some dis@@ incl@@ ination to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , he said , he seemed to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a term of health reasons and said he had any health problem for any health reasons .
this year he only under@@ signed two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb so hard worked so hard for him , would represent no guarantee for an automatic way to work as Assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ dies said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and musician , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions we can no longer answer .
after the escape from campus , police came later on Lam@@ bs lane when he recovered in Mississippi , Arkan@@ s@@ as import .
before he could be arrested , killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a home approximately a mile south of his parents &apos; block on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there .
he grew up in the area .
he started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 residents and signed geography and ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he received his doct@@ orate in the spring in Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
one of the many years of friends lam@@ bs him as an intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together by shared friends .
she and her friends were at the high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar game .
he was the woman of the woman then .
all girls mel@@ ted there when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson For@@ city of Bran@@ don herself .
Lamb and pr@@ enti@@ ers were obviously some time together .
in the emergency , he said , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage .
you had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that was adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ce , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were dropped 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said he had never met him , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
he met Pr@@ ism ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago , both on a summer @-@ year .
later they played together the one or the other G@@ ig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said his daughter wrote and sings her own music .
Pr@@ en@@ ss was a nurse , which worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ ingly coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he performed his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ic game finished in front of a f@@ aint audience .
there was no evidence that anything not happened .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the sitting and scre@@ ened together .
I mean they both had a good sense of sh@@ ear .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , leading the first semester seminar program and specialized on American original people and colonial history , says Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the students @-@ Committee .
on Tuesday night campus in Cleveland participated in Tuesday night about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the municipality on a candle agent .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated too at the Mah@@ n@@ ost , while the Universal C@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be taken on Wednesday again .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police made an emergency , after he shot his shot , and that lamb was indeed distinguished by his wife as his wife , but there is no indication of the fact that the two have ever mar@@ ry .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also distinguished for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre looking at the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is adjacent to me , and it is gradually clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN Security says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon , his response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss demands again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to uni@@ fy and integrate integr@@ ative negotiations on a finding a political solution .
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet foreign ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the meeting at the meeting in Syria , to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the courts in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the achievement of nuclear De@@ als with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious about taking it seriously .
some have tried to brand it as flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks in surveys below , it has not worked .
ten of the last eleven domestic surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in a double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate gul@@ f .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts say that at this time in 2011 , Rick &apos;s leadership was given rise to the rising Herman Cain , none of whom only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have been struggling with a general election .
but out@@ sides @-@ groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ Bush &apos;s Super PAC , and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and begin to let off their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicates that the real estate ad@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular properties have turned up to 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its candidate mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate fashion positive .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ voting in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 per cent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent ) , they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite , the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and ex@@ iting statements , 52 percent of the Irish @-@ capit@@ ulators of Irish voters , that the real temper@@ ament is for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the State state of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent say that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his ministry , and nearly six of 10 independ@@ ents may say that his temper@@ ament does not lay in the White House , so ABC / Post .
re@@ public@@ s voters get used to the idea .
if she set up their nests , keep re@@ publi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten , that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : God &apos;s voters did not have the clear@@ est Crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidate of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , the majority of GO@@ P voters are shown to be plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp proposes almost everybody .
some experts point out that the spl@@ itter hic field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s management , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ support is disper@@ sed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp was the multilingual support .
he is front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points right before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , prior to J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally by edge Paul , John Ka@@ themselves and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a succ@@ inct majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say that they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ torate , the Tru@@ mp will support , say that they have already awarded their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say that they have formed their minds twice as often for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans said they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in the subject of immigration .
since then Donald Tru@@ mp have been in his election campaign two months immigrants from Mexico , &quot; rape , &quot; was the immigration of filming and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that bom@@ bas@@ tic transi@@ tioning of Tru@@ mp is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will be damaged by re@@ orientation .
but following the new ABC / Post survey from Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans said that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in questions of immigration .
so as long as the in@@ filtration in the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp is apparently doing as well .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s to new levels .
at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , about half of the support from re@@ publi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans said in the new Monday @-@ pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry on Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Re@@ public@@ ans over the Republi@@ can in Congress are frustr@@ ated with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive gated residential buildings in Germany
here at the Hob@@ ok@@ en@@ weg , there is the most expensive living area - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street costs a square meter of a deer @-@ house at the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special conditions , one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euro per square meter for a student code in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the price does not come as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Estate provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ k@@ kers has released a ranking of the exclusive German housing locations - with square awards at fluctu@@ ating heights .
some ten thousand Euros , nothing - per square meter , occurred .
but good , who can afford that ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally time not at the head .
Champions League : Bayern - Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
doubt arch@@ ers in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy new hit by Thomas Müller ar@@ ouses the FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ ere - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have compiled a dream start to FC Bayern in Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their start @-@ play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion olymp@@ ic in hot atmosphere thanks to the gar@@ bage @-@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol out there ( 8@@ 9 ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally bring down the H@@ ardi@@ ola in the third attempt to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received at his 28th place at the Champions League to Bayern Certificate Hol@@ ly Adv@@ ance of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto , who had allowed to happen as a f@@ lange &apos;s thought by the master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised by Bayern sti@@ n Philipp Lah@@ m before the game in the car@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ flo@@ wering fans - and the Mün@@ chner remained the word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams were defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they went brave and ran through their offensive efforts but often to come to works .
the attacks were often initiated via game shift in link sau@@ ces Douglas Costa introduced , which was rare through the previous Braunschweig region O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had no more luck from the right side than his f@@ lange out of the right half @-@ field in the left wing p@@ eck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Bu@@ ak@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ally Brown hit the head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then sent by regular the go@@ alie , Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
though the Bayern have moved to their stom@@ ed game , Piraeus could get con@@ i@@ che .
on Tor@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was tick@@ eting .
so , as he had a shot of ide@@ on on the l@@ utes ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ person with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the ca@@ der , sat across the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Championship has only been given after the final training , Matthias Sam@@ mer said with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this has already become mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he brought King@@ ley Com@@ an for the clever Lew@@ in@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
gods arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still sat on it .
in front of the game it was all started in the stadium for Kra@@ w@@ alle .
after a smaller group of partly diver@@ ted Bavaria fans in their audience block , apparently the supporters of hosts were prov@@ oked with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces and went with impact on the mu@@ cks of Munich .
at least a Bav@@ arian fan was in@@ ju@@ red from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who scre@@ wed , therefore not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which lays close to a long @-@ term study near .
the good news : in case of interest , the risk decl@@ ines fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly elevated risk to lose their teeth early .
this is based on a long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tion@@ Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , I lay the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to get the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
major contribut@@ ors for tooth loss be tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth @-@ fle@@ ction , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor to emphasize the authors .
the connection between smoking and waste water will therefore go back to frequent dental infl@@ amed g@@ ums in smoking .
do not be clari@@ fied , to what extent do smoking also increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat goes back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , the first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smo@@ kers who stated study leaders of a Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to good dental health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population affected in the age of 65 to 74 years , DI@@ B@@ E divided up with .
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study will undergo the fun@@ ct .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over TTIP
the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlantic Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration proceeding .
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be resolved by a transparent system that corresponds clearly more traditional dishes in its work@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that will trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström during the introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sch@@ lich@@ in has before , launched the proposal as a European negoti@@ ator position in the US &apos;s free @-@ trade talks .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is expected to create the largest free @-@ trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings can be made con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely in particular that the EU states and the US will vote independent judges for a new investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are expected to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against judgments .
until now the inter@@ working parties involved with each other at the arbitr@@ ator , there was no objection to their judgments .
in the discussion of past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice does not trust , commented Malm@@ ström today .
in the long term , it wants to go on an International Dec@@ ral Tribunal for its own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbitration grants to be considered primarily by major companies ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration is critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , about the company damages , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first statements anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act , the proposals of the European Commission are considered inadequate .
the objective was to be critici@@ zed especially that they are not intended to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German Economic State Department Matthias Mach@@ ine@@ ( SPD ) stated the plans in contrast to great progress .
the Commission considered critical points in the reform of Sig@@ mar Gabriel set up in the spring of other EU trade ministers .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ n debut in the question of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ennial debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tensions
the new Labour @-@ Chair of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ n shall be his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and made it up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six primary questions shortly after noon , although his performance was likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called the &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he also said that he could transfer some sessions to leave her colleagues .
this will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns management , for it comes after his appointment as a member of the fun@@ eral par@@ l@@ ary , and after his speech at the Tu@@ c annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the singing of the National hy@@ mn is prov@@ oked at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , with criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs , stands at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he did the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party chairman , he got the Labour chairman to sing the national @-@ hy@@ mn , &quot; independently &quot; by his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ mini@@ sters have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n top mann@@ age , and they also refer to differences with the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &apos; stack , and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limit for winnings .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said the Tu@@ c conference to put Labour Party issues in order to remove the whole idea of a restriction in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ ising Minister said that the Party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr T@@ by@@ n will be the 5th Labour Chair with David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory leader in the final decade over the dispute @-@ Box in the Parliament .
the Labour Party , who promised a different policy element , says that he gave the &quot; crow@@ d@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister got the Prime Minister to confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain with re@@ perc@@ ussions &quot; and that it has done on serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadows of companies represented in it , if he is not participating - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to the conversation that other colleagues occasionally hold the word and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the floor , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; who is often linked to the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he dre@@ amed that he has failed .
since she was first sent on television in 1990 , the fra@@ il was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position on his parliament@@ arians , although critics argue that it became a caric@@ ature and provo@@ ke expan@@ sive reforms .

the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded by increasing 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals AB of In@@ v was acquired .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ vice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry @-@ shares were based on encouraging messages from the competition Group for lux@@ uries Ri@@ chemical plants 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts newest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that its sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again announces growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climbed by 5 % after the mining Group said that it has taken 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of his strategy of debt relief . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but it is unlikely that these merchants will pay the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could make the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that might mean there are fewer extra jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for the complaints in the advertising print of the super@@ bow@@ ls he k@@ assi@@ fied three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company gave many , many dollars a bending account .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Leb@@ an@@ tic on Pot@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er &apos;s idea
potatoes or don@@ er ?
it goes both - and in the potato d@@ ain@@ es , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger Im@@ b@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay developed .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A movement Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sp@@ ie@@ ce .
the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the title &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television .
since then there is a barbe@@ cu@@ le in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea has now let the House of Lebanon register at the patent @-@ office in Munich .
there she has recently been protected as a utility model since the FDA has been published .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ ie@@ ce contains , Al@@ h@@ ay wants therefore to betra@@ y this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also with its customers the culinary experiences come well .
met@@ cash starts working @-@ speed campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ a-
Met@@ rede@@ em@@ es tries to protect the Ig@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ als has started a summ@@ its campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , rein@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about social media on , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands like ice @-@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distributed in Ig@@ A shops samples and shop owner , the remaining tickets for the South Australian football tel@@ ev@@ ised to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ als will find further details of its defence strategy on 29 September , when the wholes@@ aler for Food , Al@@ co@@ hol and Devices conduc@@ ts his annual investor strategy .
there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make nearly 30 percent of Ig@@ or Ig@@ A shop @-@ shops and higher pay@@ outs as a met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A network in the east states .
Le@@ ad buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 per cent in Eastern Australia .
however , analy@@ st such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening up his first markets were able to grab some five percent of the food market in these two states , and take advantage of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
a report published in this week is estimated that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 $ million per year and Met@@ rede@@ em@@ able 250 million $ by end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open to 25 branch in SA and 30 in WA , and achieves a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and gro@@ c@@ eries and in the quantities of Met@@ cas@@ hs of the high fixed costs could cost roughly 13 million dollars in profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ als lost market shares in the East states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey carried out by Roy Morgan that Ig@@ A @-@ shopping are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley participates that Met@@ alli@@ c &apos;s sales at the food and grocery business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 , will fall by 4.4 percent in 2017 and 2.4 per cent in 2017 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish dou@@ ish doubles , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne , that metals may probably disappear within a decade . met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ ers refused to react publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a committee member of Met@@ Cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ cas@@ hs nutritional and food outlets , which has about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , has been noticed by 43 percent since 2012 , resulting in high @-@ quality pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler w@@ ns however and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to make sales prices with col@@ es and week@@ days at hundreds of products each week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in order to improve their stores by quickly growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label products .
Met@@ alli@@ c &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and loading of remedi@@ ation programs will gain in vig@@ or and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return for the first time in four years back to a profit growth .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral he@@ aters &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick , and deserves to consider the president of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is called again as a &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; touched by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios to Wa@@ an Wa@@ ro@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying cont@@ ests in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati very soon afterwards , Kok@@ te@@ akis had to be separated twice through the arbitr@@ ators , and Har@@ rison had to hit him twice through the arbitr@@ ators , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he cr@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a batt@@ ling was breaking a potential US @-@ open @-@ win of Richard T@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly .
the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final stage against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I am quite brave , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was a little into the battle , &quot; says He@@ aly .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost because of a class struggle in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et made of frustration with himself , and I know O@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has kept extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he earned much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around her , and I believe he was a little too tight .
he is a very un@@ ri@@ pe 19 @-@ seven , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is still working in the locker area , he exercises hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration the decision to take into consideration the decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the proper one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term member into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the Contro@@ ll@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was very fast doing the rise , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he goes into the eyes of the public , and he made some ev@@ ils mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets , but in which he can only think about it , I consider adequate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe Rel@@ ief Cris@@ is : Hungary Reg@@ ulates the border , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the state of state and broke the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all notes who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ es on the border , as hundreds of migrants recorded in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials acted to re@@ acted .
the people who had escaped from violence fell for an unknown period in a district of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled in there .
but frustration went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some extracts from protest food and water back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia stated that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would return from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and will not be a cell damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to take place talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came for a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block with a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who seek shelter in the over@@ hau@@ led Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on an international action by Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Not@@ u@@ ene Emer@@ gency in two southern regions gave more authority to overcome the crisis so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Secretary of State Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire , along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers have been employed in the race to create the bar@@ bed fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant increase in Syria for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East towards a significant ski@@ pass and a reference point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that most of the incoming economic migrants are seeking better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall za@@ zen , which led the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for condemned human retailers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said governmental speakers from Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ por@@ ters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still approve the use of the military , even the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border with heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days already .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come across , destroying the fence , they are now in police war@@ like and are accused of off@@ ences by criminal off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian civil officers concluded on the Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a draw car with spi@@ ky dra@@ ined to close the borders .
chaos rolling the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and push a crowd to push themselves up there .
some 20 managed to get there , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants were blocked the most important auto@@ bahn connections from Serbia and Hungary and said that they would not refuse Food and Water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons lead to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in the national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is holding her to the ground .
Clinton has now reached the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in presidential elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increases by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not pro@@ claims for the presidential office , will get support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election .
more than five months prior to the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion will be established which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some gains .
Clinton is holding a large head start on women and the moder@@ ates , but this le@@ aps have decreased .
your support in the males has declined significantly , and S@@ anders will only be returned here with 5 points .
at the age of 50 elec@@ tors , Clin@@ tons have become an advantage for democratic voters less than 50 years ago , and they are now at the same altitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big head start with the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton had been in the last month , S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit advantage with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections will say so far that they would like to support President Clinton , when it was nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some inci@@ dents and further 15 per cent would only support them because they are the nom@@ inee .
six per cent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons @-@ current supporters especially inspired by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be delighted .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the presidential election say they Clinton endor@@ se him with enthusiasm , tell less re@@ publi@@ can voters this about their peak @-@ channel data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ics supporters might ask in an open question why they want it to be the nom@@ inee as it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
at Clin@@ ics supporters , Clinton had also been mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of problems and voters are also quoted .
since the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters want to be asked by the presidential elections , who would be their second choice for the Party is Bi@@ den .
at clinics &apos;s followers more than half that Bi@@ den their second choice would be far ahead .
choose Bi@@ den , not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , the Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ton head ex@@ poses S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the bet on 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a nom@@ inee as a candidate with the best opportunities to win , but this number of 78 per cent in the last month was dropped .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bar@@ gain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , during the question of what is more important in a Candi@@ date , democr@@ acies call themselves questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as last month no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters would be unacceptable to the presidential election .
the Democratic Candi@@ dates or potential candidates show good results in some important qualities in voters in the presidential election of their party .
maj@@ orities are viewing the Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ ds take the best candidates with the three candidates at honesty , while Clin@@ tons might power the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
democratic voters of the presidential elections see in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements something like a quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of what is different .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton , will be provided on a personal email address and a server during the period of office as an out@@ post office , most of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions are not affected as a whole .
but it is a different story in the American public .
even half of the Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the issue of light came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy sur@@ faced with no impact on their overall opinions from Clinton , although 36 per cent told their opinion about it still deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , saying that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered by the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote should not be for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the constitu@@ encies but well as Tru@@ mp are not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are still receiving good notes at tour .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush respond best to honesty .
a majority looks more like honest , but like at Car@@ son many do not have an opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic elec@@ tors in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches at a nationwide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is situated in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tru@@ mp
in the meantime , half of the support for voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically declined .
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide reg@@ mp in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News alert last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also yiel@@ ded that Car@@ son at demo@@ graphic groups is well received and tru@@ mp under re@@ publi@@ can voters on higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is merged with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen apart from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hou@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio there are 6 % on the third place .
the troubles@@ hooting in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents in this recent survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - he lands at 19 % assistance with the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp distin@@ ctly from Car@@ son .
with a view of one in the last week of ascending Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side @-@ stra@@ in@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised himself for it , Tru@@ mp@@ s believes in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on previous Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood will be charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Neu@@ er .
almost two years after a student during a single @-@ channel ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , are filed for five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory period in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , resulting in his death divided the police with .
officials said that he had been stra@@ ined with linked eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repe@@ ats as he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI leaders do not provide the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , in order to seek advice , said Mr Chris Wagner in a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , the utensils began to hide and put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood , fundamentally above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved and he died the next morning he died of his wounds .
after an automatic sc@@ ast , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt power inj@@ uri@@ ed on head , trunk and th@@ ig@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year to the ra@@ ils , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for the first five members at the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indi@@ cted on account of Shi@@ ps and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want not only to take the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially or in@@ officially - this is gentle , we will also hold them accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College is prohibited the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a su@@ mp@@ on@@ eness comes , and its sli@@ ders will get into fall , Ren@@ di@@ ets for bonds will rise , and the economy is sli@@ pping into a recession .
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it is to keep .
in particular , the history for the economy provides only low guidance for the procedure .
a recession came over only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve at the raising of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have argued that they should not focus on when it starts to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact multiple variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement because of a devast@@ ation could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Princip@@ al of Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , in order to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here , a historical trend @-@ based view of how some areas of the economy might respond :
as the market has seen in the last month , the deportation of tents can make things for a while fully .
once the increase meets , the influence is not that dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that investments repeated 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts in a newer study to what happens after the progression of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has mostly been ongoing in the last 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the path to the place level , fairly flat in the last six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Chef Annex C@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ veen Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the booster cycle and starts return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but re@@ plac@@ ings often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which could not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
extremely notable is that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product will be near its lowest point at a tents of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , amoun@@ ted to 118 percent of GDP has been taken by 118 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.@@ 6 per cent , only few that this regret will last , and expect to expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed just 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ advertise under such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants made up the whole year on a tents of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were judged on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which finishes on Thursday .
while many str@@ ate@@ ers and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could authori@@ ze an increase in this session , the f@@ ut@@ ures trading gives only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all the achievements of 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with increased momentum in GDP &quot; taken place and on @-@ day rec@@ tions are quickly put to the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; said the report .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest standing the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months now .
the fixed in@@ comes was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market takes a igni@@ tion cav@@ ity , and the pattern is fairly similar as in the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with the shares if they change their strategic direction .
if bonds appear to change the direction once the first increase / lowering in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increases the hi@@ kers fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab consider that the increase in the interest rates will result in that rendering between longer and shorter bonds will bring closer and lead to a rec@@ ess of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ off@@ s bonds often bring better income in such a climate even though &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we are still careful to have higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interesting , Jones doesn &apos;t mean that markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed Strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are some indications that the market has been adapted to the prospect of stri@@ c@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings situation is fl@@ atter , cre@@ ak@@ ening , and the vol@@ ati@@ lity still has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
throughout the large and entire businesses that cover the larger segment of your business in the US , profit from where interest rates increase and local products are more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multination@@ als with high debts are worse off , as an rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and are likewise the financing of their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares ten@@ ers to react very positively to three months after initial investment growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the company with a strong balance sheet after each of the under@@ growth cases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital ren@@ di@@ als and lower vol@@ ati@@ lity in their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality around average ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , he said gold man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure stock market , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts in different opinions are how quickly it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , member of parliament@@ arians , Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly distinct from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she was just The Br@@ its
race @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the mission The Voice an and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts up to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliament@@ arians and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something the individual sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal Radi@@ os@@ ender was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m not like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously known examples where you actually only have the im@@ it@@ one that is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Director ceas@@ ed the preliminary examination and argued that BBC Radio 3 is still ahead of its commercial competitors if it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn about Radio 3 , I &apos;m unable to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ parall@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works in order , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work harder to engage the audience when they are in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC @-@ production , which during the hearing included in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for it under fire to enter commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ Euro Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got The Voice on - the musical talent show by the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the cost of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ am@@ Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; produced on special BBC @-@ fashion . &quot;
he added that he would like the company &quot; taking a hit from our own shed , &quot; if the next time had a entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the Future or to spend money to it@@ ators for other entertainment formats .
Internet Prin@@ ciples in August on slow and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using a cell phone for storing
experts believe that the Black Friday had stopped after November in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into Gei@@ ster@@ tal .
yet experts say that there are signs now that the online hands are st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the years and until 2000 go back , it has always been evolving over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales divisions .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when he started to make shopping with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself and we will possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America is cited as a reason for the l@@ ass@@ ent revenues .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some retailers cr@@ ashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer went to fight for bar@@ gain , buyers from going to make shopping .
a part of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that a total of 5 £ spending is no more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and wash@@ ers , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the ranks in the inner cities .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
British occupy more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe has left behind
this leads to the fact that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops which are aimed at arti@@ sans
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales sectors will close nationwide
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that British to put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who perform the work in their home
if you can sk@@ ill@@ fully deal with a hammer or a brush to the rise of walls , you still belong to a minority .
for British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to perform home@@ coming jobs in their homes , so chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new business manager of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the builder chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe , offer services at low price prices .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are interested in tra@@ des@@ men and close 60 points of sales from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment we weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends that would show more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this to a balance more quickly .
basically , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of items by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 , has also turned their top team to reflect equal numbers of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that employs 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial status .

he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to secondary mandate , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the accused in 2006 until 2011 were mis@@ used by the accounts , over which they were allowed to use in their functions , for private purposes .

the post@@ ures of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity put the defence attached to the association to no point in time an asset .
the sports@@ men would have been calculated for compensation and the sports club , for which she had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , from debts - the pas@@ si@@ ties wor@@ ship@@ pers in 2001 about 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( around 4@@ 4,000 euros ) .
&quot; back then we were in front of the situation : do we continue to stop the club or block it ? &quot; re@@ marked one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ making and audi@@ tor of the financial am@@ ts .
he decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been up@@ shot money , our life insurance acts as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the closing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be agreed with the club : you can freely manage the money ; it must not be made a debt .
furthermore , with proportion@@ ate financial success the payout of the allow@@ ance for damage to 1991 has been decided by 1991 .
for this reason , one portion of the allow@@ ance is only years later , namely from the year 2003 , as an increase in the account has been paid out .
therefore also l@@ ump @-@ work - and not detailed finishes click on , explained the former homeless .
the accounts and spar@@ se managed the two accused , said the second accused .
why the payments of the association has not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
the society did not interest in detail for the financial statements , important was only the debt of debt , so the answer .
as in 2011 , against the one in 2011 , an investment of 120@@ .000 Euros was started , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 began to account in the organisation of the association .
these were pl@@ agues , declared the accused .
this securities account kept on the name of the second accused , and was not aware of the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
there@@ on I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said finally , he did believe that this is the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , prosec@@ utor presented itself into the room .
the def@@ endant was always informed , ri@@ fer@@ ed himself of the function@@ ary .
this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; claims . &quot;
why dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
the first accused , he had not agreed with this wording as the association has never made any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the user said he never ordered a pen@@ ny content , he only rate o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
an di@@ ets he put into account the association 1.000 Euro per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added .
however , detailed documents for the early years were not intended to assign the accused .
these are after an operation , in which everything was judged properly , no longer stored , said they .
o@@ dom@@ eter has also had the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all land@@ ings be in cash , in addition , he had to drive from his home town to the bank to the Bank of B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main proceedings will continue with the survey of witnesses on September 23 .

the decision on interest rates for the US @-@ denom@@ inations
the world ob@@ serves when the U.S. staff should gather at two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest should be lifted up or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists , which were inter@@ viewed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , that still last week of view was that the F@@ ed is going to do so , now that the F@@ ed is still somewhat longer har@@ dened and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent will hold .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank may start the zero @-@ range and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , guiding staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a fairly good performance , tri@@ lli@@ on dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less striking view of global circumstances .
she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision is to be notified at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death shooter at the Delta State University left dischar@@ ging
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the sho@@ cking and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he wrote his colleagues a note later on the day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could do it in@@ happen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he was lecturer for geography and soci@@ ological education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot on someone and someone killed .
he said the representative of the emergency room that police officers must send to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , which is but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will b@@ other &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the name of his name , but he did not give him .
he did not give explanation for his shots .
when police came to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I might und@@ o it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he was E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , sle@@ w , before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen took him out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; universal President William La@@ dies said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and musician , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , they said that Pr@@ en@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , told authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ l was signed by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years married , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but have made friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ers have had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed in the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , after statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ers .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ers had said a dog called Light@@ ning had been living with him for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said he returned to a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
as a polic@@ eman on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he ran his car to the side , fled by walking , ran into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot .
he &apos;s represented by Delta State University a PhD title in spring 2015 , as he gives a lecture on the website of the university .

Euro@@ drawings : Lufthansa to build the Group

Luke Sha@@ w von Manchester United can not play monthly for double the frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , and twice the frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this has led to the left margin of the def@@ ender for wines and won him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give hope that Sha@@ w is able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno , in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he got to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said , &quot; he has a double b@@ ang in the hospital and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United that is very hard and then playing fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red card and the ad@@ lock of an ellip@@ tical .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the i@@ b@@ ans .
van P@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had fallen .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very horrible injury . &quot;

it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .

&quot; he is struggling somewhat because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very lim@@ il@@ ous injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .

certainly David Cameron is better known ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last for long until you know it almost in@@ ward .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I would like to read my children , because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have so far missed . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead speci@@ fies a content of the movie version of 2012 that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a merchandise , hopes that a boy named T@@ ed to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Geis@@ sel lau@@ ded and the 1991 died , but totally unknown .
as if that were not yet gi@@ fted enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially depic@@ ted like the summary of the c@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named T@@ ed to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is going to become familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , just like the local environment through the cas@@ ying , trees , cra@@ fting , Th@@ ough , sn@@ ug@@ ging , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees , &quot; desol@@ ate .
most probably , such a relatively low PR @-@ task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per that The Lor@@ ax did not read each other for a child 20 times .
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ akers said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons campaigns .
Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons was shipped , but gave no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion from England , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but if one has selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat not on my map .
I would not close a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ round air C@@ ooks side is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing installation , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful and positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at a test level , is an option for the attack .
in this reference @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th moves from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is natural for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ players are aimed at results .
there was no question mark upon Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , since - and I said so - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago I extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully proposes other purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arises .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get so good performances , and this surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test stroke is given to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th was given seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , during Nick Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do both home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift up was that England was first made Jonathan Trot@@ p@@ t in the Caribbean - as l@@ th was in high @-@ form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales will come in , and he is a ch@@ mann , which I highly appreciate .
he is a X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 2@@ 36 toward a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must obtain at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team setting in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mo@@ il beside Cook , which would render an extra @-@ Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mo@@ ist may not have his job done for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he stepped up as Open@@ er .
he did away three hundred of us immediately and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of Backup spi@@ der that lift their hands and the trainers have decided to become young people .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ring@@ , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the Test@@ play could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the international Cri@@ cket Competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously said one .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ c@@ aches and team @-@ controllers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken with easy heart .

Germany war@@ y chan@@ cell@@ or Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and intends to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it did during the excessive spending such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .

actually Tony Blair presented similar to her , but stated that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you eat better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him , instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , the armed group was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans as Blair himself , as he turned on Cam@@ er@@ ons referendum , because Blair joined the principle on the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened to him a back@@ door .
the press never ev@@ ade him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday at Westminster a friendly cl@@ aps on the back - I told him that he didn &apos;t get time for me to waste water - appears in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of 80 @-@ he years to repeat , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ bi@@ &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .

it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A charity , but not a B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years when his old father fought for his efforts on television to go @-@ loyal to his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s battle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , and what J@@ C told his comrades and parliament@@ arians according to all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ b@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline stays important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ le of Social Media , a brood @-@ care of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right that Cameron wants to give no free entry visa for Europe that allows him to keep F@@ ours support in the message campaign for granted , just as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental self @-@ awareness - in harmony with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ faction economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left Dis@@ sid@@ ents for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ cism is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find in everything a sense of their super@@ vis@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ed political capital - they have also susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be all meaning@@ less ?

experts critici@@ ze the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes was less detri@@ mental than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , were joining the Lanc@@ et to critici@@ ze the evidence by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; base report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the res@@ ili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month has attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Immun@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expected that the claim of P@@ he is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less damaging than smoking &quot; based on a detailed check of references and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ purpose decision @-@ decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine @-@ hal@@ ted products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes supplier , but not the funding he has received after reports beforehand by the Tob@@ acco Group Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes &apos;s champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a branch of industries on paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco was attended by P@@ he .
the research work of the group &quot; design@@ ations &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products by most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , there is no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; claims of P@@ he said that &quot; there has so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes has so far been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
- Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that he has responded to the claims of BM@@ J already before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that which we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is evi@@ den@@ ced and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion £ per year .
by clear advantages of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up blue En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &apos; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs sent not by other UK radio stations .
he critici@@ zed the BBC , that they are considered public @-@ legal programs , which are probably seen by a smaller audience , placed in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC Programs created in order or sends , which would also clearly be shown by not sub@@ merged ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to hold the broad@@ casting fee , what I do not think medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least give your production at least to programs that others do not make or to order .
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous it is natural nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed which could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both re@@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I comp@@ ass to see how this should be public @-@ clear television .
I don &apos;t believe this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , the channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will again give again what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ es@@ gar@@ t lecture at Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ on .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal framework programs can go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure quite the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they &apos;re preparing for their seem@@ ing missions to complete 4 billion £ 0.5 charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ rolling programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a window @-@ window , in which no one wanted to ever see them .
for the broadcast sign , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions which can get the best value in it .
of course , think all of us think that one gets a great value for 150 l@@ bs a year here , but for guys that &apos;s for the 150 £ a lot of money is wondering if this is true , because it does not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check out their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; to form and to entertain . &quot;
he said only little of BBC @-@ production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio . and it should inform yourself of public law channels in Australia and Canada as an example , clarify and conver@@ se . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from whom he said that only a handful of television can enter , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers , alliances in order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ graph &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at that moment in which they will be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred lit@@ ters with gene@@ tically modified nerve systems , that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have gr@@ asp@@ ing with sound impul@@ ses that have been heard for human hearing to high frequencies in order to be heard .
the impul@@ ses are working through the inser@@ tion of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to wear the membrane channels , which respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
read more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ graph , where ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to The Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impetus to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fai@@ th@@ fi@@ sts are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then inv@@ ade into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms @-@ cells .
the reson@@ let effect the opening of these I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and activate the cells in which they are assigned , thus a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ id , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ised TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels have to wear .
if he attacks ultras@@ ound to the modified creatures , the mu@@ c@@ rank@@ shafts are reinforced by the micro@@ waves and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has several similarities with Op@@ to@@ on , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulse of light and switch off .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ka could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , that must be sent to an optical fiber in the desired location in the brain , low @-@ rate ultras@@ ound waves can happen and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gen@@ res and a therapeutic virus it is possible to render the zi@@ pped human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications might focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed by the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - by an un@@ iting of the Excel Calendar and thinking : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they played with the invention of a realistic si@@ ze@@ al company , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish @-@ eyes with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es from Am@@ nest@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an opening of the British government and the guarantee that torture tools are not illeg@@ ally acted upon our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in students
eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dormitory , still in faith at Ber@@ ets and moral swe@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I have angry - and on the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move in Stud@@ enten@@ hom@@ me ranges from slightly ner@@ jump @-@ only to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sne@@ aking up : people wh@@ ence you come , if and where you &apos;ve picked Sab@@ b@@ year and why you &quot; honestly , Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extra@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - job questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you figure out the people who you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would result in fire and these fire@@ works would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people are often turning into fluid recep@@ tions , film night events and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people prefer to pull themselves and their under@@ wear .
related to this : remember not to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ly received a rough handling at the University .
their room should be a refuge , but many student homes form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I will know that our friendship continues , but you have to go away , so that I get the energy back , which I consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comm@@ uting of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos ! do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ ck is imag@@ ining the doors of people , in order to imagine with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome in the neighbourhood , I have you something che@@ ek . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made goo@@ dies , is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates are committed to entertain yourself and will end up perhaps your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent ch@@ uck .
badly mis@@ led l@@ ump from flour , su@@ gar@@ s and gre@@ ase makes that people feel sleeping when you are ank@@ ering .
to ste@@ al food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check the with the owner owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
when someone gr@@ asp@@ ed your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with a balanced approach than my room@@ mate , who added to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
they should not make any noise which stops people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent human being , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb says to the people who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hallway asks her neighbors , whether there is something to turn to them , Drum &amp; bass , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning .
you responded to it with even more later music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she was able to sleep her neighbors with two hours before she supp@@ le her own music , shut her doors and set off to its three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrassing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , turn to them and then you will have to see each day and perhaps join it as they bring together all common friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart is about its own path - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your om@@ b .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that somebody has his keys to lie in his not locked room , the boundary between a ul@@ k and bullying is fine , than it seems .
a good spre@@ y is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give through obs@@ cur@@ ls a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terr@@ aced houses for refugees , all@@ u@@ er@@ ecting , t@@ ing@@ ear@@ ing
the estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the medi@@ al corner of the Eck@@ ental Wall@@ ets for People who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but as much as the mother &apos;s alone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulling @-@ ear@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can still buy cheap and well today &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the business@@ men Markus G@@ ild@@ a believes to know how quickly your housing space can be created : it builds on a project of town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ a , a lot of refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people remain in a great deal here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the refugee voltage we need sufficient living space over the coming decades .
a very common , three storey building house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a building house needs a least space .
it facilitates the integration .
that is different when people are taking the people in the bare @-@ blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees shall say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be easily modified according to the respective needs .
how much are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ a : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house rests on 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the construction has taken .
this is appropriate .
have the building ad@@ vices their plans more complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : so I have checked my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated , it always makes the dro@@ h@@ end di@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special building and the adjusting regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lining who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents have responded to their matur@@ ation project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were who have accused of creating luxury builds for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do not tough@@ en you in terms of competitive apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is it : we have had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years but have been build luxury apartments that hardly can afford a bit more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but as much as the mother &apos;s alone , or the Ger@@ ing@@ con@@ ener .
I am showing how to still be cheap and well maintained today .
therefore , it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to obtain the new iPhone OS when Apple update will be released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typ@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after installation to trouble , since they get an error message , that communic@@ ates that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is fail@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to get the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this by mer@@ ging the updates unknown . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it once the process is completed .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during an update or located near a char@@ gers so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , as the phone may possibly decreases along way and this might lead to a break@@ age of the update .

Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Field &apos;s .
we are also looking forward to Sam@@ t@@ le@@ vice @-@ champion Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promoting Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf against the other hand has fortunately : there Dr. Frank Müller received the practice Fel@@ ste@@ al .
during Ur@@ sel Field &apos;s retirement , her husband is standing Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor in the coming months with half a passage to the page .
after a reconstruction , Müller launched the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 Euros in the premises on the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
he was sympathy at first glance than the field &apos;s field before Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met too , who currently completed their specialised studies in the Ver@@ den@@ er hospital and will also go into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ al and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was there , I was just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover Müller looked the idea to be able to operate in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he will see his own boss soon .

from 19 September the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon who works to Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich rim as a doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ship ) special@@ ises in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle in as house@@ holder .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after conversion , the rooms are modern look .
we will provide more ultras@@ ound studies as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ EC@@ GS and need a speaking room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will receive the gar@@ bage dump as part of a funding program from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice is continued &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ le@@ vice master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter in the practice field ste@@ al , in the North German aver@@ ance practice it is about 500 .
there is another home@@ op@@ ress in As@@ endorf .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Field c@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
who visits the tr@@ ash @-@ language , by the way continues to look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleansing from the field .
with their departure , there is a era in As@@ endorf and after all the medi@@ cs have been doing for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Field c@@ annon .
a little sad@@ ness di@@ gest it after the long time already .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are sure to see still often , &quot; says the boarding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your husband will be comple@@ mented : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed me from gardening , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls also lead to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dom@@ mini@@ ster@@ in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls at the Hungarian border always remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still be clear that everyone wants to achieve a asylum application , this can also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stands in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are distinct signs , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prime minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept limit@@ less mig@@ r@@ ations , even over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia has denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travel to Slovenia and Germany in direction to Austria and Germany and also can also establish cor@@ ridors for refugees .
strictly speaking , this was not the interior of the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ s@@ our Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia becomes rather the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary - intensi@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia could be seen as a limit of the limit on the other hand .
like the Minister of Ministers , Slovenia wants to dis@@ agree his borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ s@@ our Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Croatian government rus@@ hed to open the first refugees in the night @-@ hours on Tuesday , in Ost@@ Croati@@ ans at the Border Cros@@ sing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d past , to mig@@ rate the registration .
the Croatian police could inter@@ fere in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik collabor@@ ates on police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo would have brought to the Maced@@ onian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however the government in Belgrade are building , however , that it should be the people put in references to specific routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , anyway in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d arrived , in the course of the day further buses would expect .
across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been travelling the whole night of the two 500 kilometres away of the Maced@@ onian border in Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has assigned , so the police declared that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , it could actually be now moving to a predicted shift of the previous Balkan route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to reach a little further west distance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of strong de@@ hydr@@ ation of refugees that have been prepared for possible om@@ ation situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia is as non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to carry out stringent controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU @-@ Partner in the country through a positive testimony , which concerns the standards of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side there are still approximately 300 refugees left behind the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media we would have spent the past night at the Border Cros@@ sing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continues to be completely disabled .
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior of the Interior of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic was trying to soo@@ the Mit@@ ge@@ och@@ et at a local market in Hor@@ gos : he retained the debates about the alternative paths of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for be@@ fore@@ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not at present act in a very high wave of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could not be said whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees out of Croatia where alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border gap between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian border , still no more spacious min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police made that a team of min@@ e@@ gro@@ wers was sent in the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ra@@ on@@ ok aims to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which is accused of having already provided insight into yet un@@ released financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information , insi@@ der trading on the financial markets should have been made .
in this way , the investig@@ ators had reported a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 further certification in the case were performed .
the majority of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have an influence both in the USA and Eastern Europe .

puls@@ ating , pr@@ it all life at a gorgeous autumn sun shine and middle @-@ rin four large tables each with the head@@ line &quot; Be@@ fore I die ... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical comm@@ ent@@ aid did attentive to this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and certainly looks quite mixed with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , therefore we are in the midst of the action in the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the head office of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic Hosp@@ iz@@ aid is available for questions and discussions at the disposal of volunteers , as well as volunteers .
while a Pass@@ ant arose spontane@@ ously into the chal@@ k and affir@@ m the proposition to &quot; my life , &quot; can &quot; read the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t have long &quot; suffer , &quot; others remaining briefly , read , say phrases like &quot; so far am I not &quot; and then go on .
again and again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
also Peter H@@ b@@ inger is just on site .
&quot; only when I make it clear to me that for me at one time the end is coming to this world , I can act responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onal plant Mannheim , which is combined with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der Ö@@ kum@@ en@@ ean Hosp@@ es aid .
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that doesn &apos;t everybody wants to communicate openly on the tablets , but be understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer , who has just helped the Hosp@@ ic@@ ism in recent years that the people open .
an assessment that contains Angel@@ ika Go@@ una .
the mort@@ ar and sad@@ der companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
through personal experience confronted with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical comm@@ ent@@ aid sought after honorary official , she immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ erl@@ itz is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the sufferers and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in hosp@@ ice St Vincent .
all are them carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ una can handle well with their purpose and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another warning , consider it valuable and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient @-@ cum@@ en@@ ical comm@@ ent@@ aries is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the insur@@ ances and donations of relatives and associations will enable training as well as training and super@@ visions of the mort@@ ar and grape companion .

F@@ ed@@ ex @-@ result Mi@@ xed , Fin@@ anz @-@ outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ ex reported dis@@ closing results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ ef@@ er Gig@@ ant lo@@ wered his winning view over a whole year because of the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ at@@ ery service .
the company also said that she plans to present some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this point last year F@@ ed@@ ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the period of production .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the market trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ ex Corp. said to earn a gain between 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , ending 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ction .
analy@@ st expected to be conducted according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospects comes despite the price increase , on average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite improved accounts for bo@@ ar@@ iness of heavy and large packages , which will be charged from November onwards .
the company said that it still expect the result compared to the previous year due to cost estimates , higher profits and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Smith said Mr Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take into consideration the weaker than anticipated economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global@@ ised trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.8 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research questions asked an@@ alysts are predicted .
sales grew by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of us asked Analy@@ ses expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ ex has reported a decline in the international priority mailing in recent years which brought revenues in his unit Express shipping to st@@ agn@@ ant .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales at bo@@ iling sport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit grew higher income due to higher prices , while the result sank due to higher labor costs in the cargo business .
in the market trade , about an hour prior to the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex @-@ shares amoun@@ ted to 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 per cent under a record high@@ lighting the 11th of June .
at their most anticipated meeting in the year of the Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist two days this week round a 27 @-@ minute drive @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to push the lad@@ ders .
counting on them at an end of the bel@@ ated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed sitting council , a m@@ ural of the United States is located .
the map is one reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order of Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the major recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ checked third mandate - financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the un@@ parall@@ eled appeal of the close short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows strongly , the recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets that make already more pru@@ dent F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives will be anxi@@ ous to increase these vol@@ ati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it even just a quarter of percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market enough jus@@ tification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is needed , which ass@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists were recently investigated by Bloomberg as they predicted cement of this week .
the financial markets await , however , a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline of the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the str@@ ate@@ ers differ from the impact , by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ s@@ wert by 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the proposition in this week of sustain@@ ing , said John Lon@@ ski , Princip@@ ality at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would stand the propositions at this time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to re@@ assure the financial markets so that she is not in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a tents would re@@ assure the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even before a month the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set around 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
Y@@ et had said in spring and in early summer , that in this year despite the complaints from the liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labor market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage levels have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation is permanently proce@@ eded under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effects of much lower oil prices .
the economy , &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Princip@@ ality with Pantheon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets picked up at the end of the last month after China had valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial Co@@ verage was made in May by more than 16 % under his peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in Chinese economy would be the global growth of D@@ ros@@ aries .
the market has recovered something in this month whereby the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the high of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market struggles affecting the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she is waiting for at least a month to get the impact better on the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed . therefore , it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was considerable in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere suggestion of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tight expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the con@@ vol@@ tages across the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives can expect not only to monitor the developments at another site , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art as science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Car@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has established a story of over@@ reactions in financial market movements which seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
l@@ acker , directed Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a cement of cement , ass@@ or@@ ted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its gu@@ ins by 0.2 percent points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said l@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives were rever@@ ence .
the F@@ ed should put some aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the re@@ unification process in 2008 , &quot; Adam S. Poznań , former member of the committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly did not want to go to the situation in which she is afraid of a place of tents , because the markets turn out , &quot; says Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe they should hurry ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the dedication of innum@@ erable volunteer don@@ ors .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is the body and the soul teacher .
also with their 74 lum@@ ber they are still taught .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
and of course , this is quite different in class than at a real school .
bra@@ silien pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy embro@@ ider@@ y
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies which are used to bro@@ ws with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , Schw@@ ang@@ eren and Young mothers get out to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest@@ ing that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that should be made of the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ards of the Spor@@ hall
the municipal service Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar power .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gymn@@ as@@ tics in the Bern@@ ese Sport Area are progres@@ sing step by step : in the youngest council meeting the planned building contract was un@@ ned without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before , the Panel among other things had decided to submit an application to a structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; exception &quot; it was to permission for a special form in the roof construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; se@@ mit@@ d@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built with non @-@ mit@@ e@@ ful First and Dach@@ stein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar power plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large addi@@ ct , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; one went again to the roof @-@ prop@@ ens@@ ation that is required for energetic reasons - differently than the development plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the vi@@ a@@ version no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ese is generally dispos@@ ed of more restri@@ ctive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are thus creating a preced@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2,@@ 3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots support .
in the next process step , the construction contract for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now available to the land@@ rat@@ together for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is planned to be closed before - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new doctors director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees run from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these see the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county of Land@@ mark , which confirmed the Land@@ mark Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board is the Supervisory Board and the s@@ ails on Wednesday September 23 .
if plans are to be implemented , all of the close 50 employees would be further engaged in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be pulling with fishermen and the further existing train station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the co @-@ workers , who cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about their plans .
triggered the change of cancellation Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been at the beginning of the annual General Director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now switch to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
upon the question of who the successor was to take , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; entered into the game , who declared himself ready to take over the guidance and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inner Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for sav@@ ory and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
for the next two years , fishermen , with his team , is to give up fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board det@@ ects the two houses , until next year the former hospital of cr@@ app@@ es which still has 35 beds and should be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
so far the country had planned this for 2018 , as the ongoing refur@@ bish@@ ment at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim was completed .
Land@@ mark Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also the chair of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors for which the house , which is owned by the federal union , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that I was continuing with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White did not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what we could not happen , such an occasion does not come back , &quot; as fishermen about the qu@@ asi @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a boss for over 30 years , have not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closing in the past decades , for instance the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the gri@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are demanded today ( 20.@@ 15 h ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

after a shot you suffered a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man serious injury and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident at first was unclear .
the Judi@@ cial Police have been identified .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of violence
an ev@@ apor@@ ator has led the police for the suffering of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the trial the 20 @-@ year old went to , the young people killed and their body was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one has been missing one since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is fallen victim to a violent @-@ violence .
the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like prosec@@ utor and police on Wednesday morning .
to be sal@@ uted , one also applies on the eve of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who , in fact , indicate the declaration that followed and the investig@@ ators reached the place of discovery of the body .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday mor@@ nings , after they had not come back home after a visit of a autumn evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially appeared to personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances , the susp@@ ici@@ on revealed finally a susp@@ ici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ ard@@ ent perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
the bi@@ ased was given by the authorities in the police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have put the corp@@ ses into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be conducted on Wednesday the o@@ lig@@ ator , investig@@ ators put him killing to the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; submission of the near@@ er circumstances of fact should bring further investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study am@@ ming of housing
the location on the German housing market is tense .
even more and more refugees look for a paid deposit .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more and more people push for a market that has already been over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ minded people around the last inexpensive apartments . ( translated with Google Translate )
to cover the demand for affordable housing , will have to build over 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result is a study on the mission of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , this year , the 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
thus there are 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are no longer obligated under their stay after the first three months of their stay than asylum seekers in a first week accommodation .
many then encounter in the apartment market and series in long periods of the rental apartments .
according to statistics of the Bundes@@ amt , last year less than half of all asylum seekers can rent for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only to the rising of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in housing farming in recent years .
Germany seemed to be a major part of housing from year to year .
currently missing in the metropolitan areas have already been around 77@@ ,000 units , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals were therefore living in big cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ inten@@ tionally staying at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meter per head has declined in the last years for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will encourage new incentives for social housing construction again .
this could be wai@@ sted on the atro@@ cities and the basic tax for subsi@@ ded dwell@@ ers are exposed .
in addition , Alliance is attractive for attractive and tax @-@ making possibilities .
the funding programme for refugee revenues at the Kf@@ W Kf@@ W has already been well connected with cities and municipalities .
during the start of the start , a good week after the start , with 184 million euros , more than half of the euro has been cancelled approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are facing a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no transit , as more refugees choose across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that allow transit through Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to deal with neighbouring countries on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian internal mini@@ stries and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the European country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the shut@@ down of Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian tel@@ ev@@ ous RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border to refugees on the day .
new laws that occurred on the same day , make over@@ due asylum processes in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the morning .
most of the most @-@ known media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian border the refugees do not encounter in the border .
instead of the border cross@@ ings of other dangers : there are more sharp mal@@ functions from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
there are now to quickly create a secure passage .
after the closure of the border there is hardly more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police of 3@@ 66 l@@ acked people .
shortly before the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 had been .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the overcoming and damaging the border as a crime .
therefore , in the Southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged , only 35 p@@ uni@@ sts were introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned EU followers up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; tran@@ sit@@ ing authority , &quot; a total of 94 asylum jobs were taken on Tuesday , nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition cr@@ us@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on the Wednesday morning there was another 40 refugees left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has a view to get asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers should be de@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to return .
it gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish that left the ten @-@ mill@@ en@@ nia of men over the past weeks on the road@@ side .
ply@@ wood have been demol@@ ished and one of the det@@ erg@@ ents in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
for the purpose of this expansion nobody wanted to express .
Austria reach the border of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants were still moving abroad , but still in the country .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning upon assignment of German authorities .
in expos@@ ures regularly , smaller groups of refugees met in a regular basis .
Mayor did the mayor &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy following the brid@@ ging on Sunday with the meeting , when suddenly ten people were with travel off@@ ners at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to get by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly closed down on Sunday but because of the refugee stro@@ ms with Austria was surprisingly , for them in Wern@@ her conclusion , &quot; as the town@@ s@@ ler who immediately stopped his help and put their cars together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously , we have only once killed the un@@ invited guests , with painting and drinks .
we have said it , we take them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire fighting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has enjoyed us very much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the got grab@@ bing in Wels on Saturday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , to move it after the short @-@ term pro@@ clamation that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
however , the regional train has been deduc@@ ted from the border with Wern@@ her &apos;s border .
in Wern@@ her is the cross @-@ border in general high in the course .
the brid@@ ging association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday had soci@@ able , Mon@@ days previously a two @-@ brid@@ led tur@@ istic , organized by the Union ham@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now ma@@ iled further Z@@ ig@@ nia is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy :
instead of helping in the Camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help the construction of structures , our Federal Chancellor has moved highly officially and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ k circuit of the National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belly @-@ carrying this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to declare that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landed land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a major challenge facing the ongoing refugee streams and the near winter , to create decent access for safety seekers .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 pen@@ sion@@ ists
Konrad has fully committed to the hand of the refugees .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the fact that his Word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen bank in order to add quot@@ a to thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the Tra@@ p Centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen dates back to the handle of Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great hosts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master &apos;s performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal Ministry of Commerce spoke on the other hand of a &quot; noble situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad is counting on a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the same year .
in order to meet the number , we have to be found 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries 15@@ ,000 of the Bund .
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a pass without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led talks with the national business .
these would have assured him even more to create quarters for the upcoming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , who is to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations of the Asyl@@ um coordin@@ ator also sets up into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen Action &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the platform allows a private and uncomplicated accommodation .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that j@@ arti@@ sans have to have a certain height of the to@@ wel or size of the upper so@@ ckets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a short @-@ term time would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the Wel@@ fare State he is more successful when placing successful , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older master , which one cannot say without further into the face of the fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness be its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they said .
your number of employees want to increase them from three to four .
the own j@@ arti@@ s has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is clearly some problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not until now an opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , since the parties currently cannot place without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , additional locations are expected to be tested on their fitness .
criticism of the director upon the distribution of refugees within the federal country .
other districts need to make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limits are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bav@@ arian prime minister N@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , the governor , Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) closed out on Monday that further steps in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accession of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there is now also the appropriate border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the cau@@ tious were brought to Germany by regular journeys to Germany .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ ers once more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads again to its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is entered , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meter ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the cl@@ atter heads are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ leader Hannes Dut@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine , invest in the start @-@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft and later also on which to sound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the beginning S &amp; T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic promises a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location of € 3.@@ 3 million from the Tech@@ center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is maintained by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of resi@@ ding in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ land@@ owner opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the center .
actually , Jutta enjoys a dog to set up a dog .
this plan had to push the 49 @-@ year representative of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Arctic short @-@ time : after all , they now have growth in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop towards the business , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and gar@@ ment of different manufacturers , now everything about Dam@@ er@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 Euro .
larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks ago was rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long over@@ taken if I want to open a shop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says broadly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was among other things that the fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location where only their hand@@ bags were sold , were done .
&quot; we are the her@@ nia in the Greater Region of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
their fashion interest has become broad by her mother in the cradle .
I sw@@ inging to me most when something is developing and I can show new trends for affordable prices .
why so many woman perform at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in shipping device , the wife can not answer with last safety .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag will evaluate each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ amm@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links it to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president wants .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for exciting .
whether it is expressed as a foreign @-@ party , journalist or knowledge was revealed in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. presidential system in@@ dem@@ ns the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cuts well with them .
this is also registered in the Pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate reign come .
the New York with the Com@@ promis@@ ist is about by many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road a term .
man@@ oeu@@ vre in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in electoral setting mode .
the K@@ all@@ y- Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that can be somehow fascinating , but are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ est@@ stad@@ ter species , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ metropolitan gets a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ inkl@@ ers shot , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz ranks .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also speak word - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
and he has not brought it to the king of his hearts .
although there respect respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to reflect that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a w@@ rest@@ or@@ y , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
random from the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ inity , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ amm@@ macher &quot; - zu Hoch@@ sel , says she .
now , Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the en@@ coder .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather had hi@@ ked and opened in the USA a local e@@ a@@ que .
corner of the property &apos;s house were first landed property in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of logic : their desire to return to the fa@@ ther@@ land , in the long time , in the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged back then .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once hated without permission , the director of the Institute of Pf@@ alz history and folk music , Roland Paul , declared the film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rants . &quot;
this is contrast to the occasionally statements of the night .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to terri@@ fy illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ em@@ aker , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born fall@@ mp , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement looks more likely to distance the Americans , &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ er@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm just mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit something for the church organ has ended , which came generally well .
&quot; I cannot imagine by Donald - &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they do it better , if he doesn &apos;t want to know the choice , because &quot; he did such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the time of his grandfather in the US had been the Sa@@ gen , would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah St@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; says it .
and : &quot; the grapes become mature without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts by N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson failed to report to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the government &apos;s loss , but it has provided no big shifts in the today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Saman@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ra , put up in London as part of a week series of international television programs , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun belonged .
this down@@ side of the condition seemed to have no part for Australian TV viewers since sunrise has reached an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five capital cities , compared to the today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has concluded the gap in sunrise at sunrise .
today , today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40@@ ,000 and 50,000 ran .
until now , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing what happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of A@@ to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recent un@@ wit@@ ched father who excl@@ u@@ des herself to settle for with both children on the New Zealand region , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and slightly suggested The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8@@ ,000 ) and T@@ B@@ L family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results on evening two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half an hour ( 17 : 00 until 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ et@@ fe sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half an hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ a of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at is ultimately going to prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollars per minute who did not manage to cover Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons &apos;s lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may not know@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , finally lan@@ ted at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was placed in the greatest secret .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be revealing if they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we packed with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day , before out of three two , check @-@ in , you may possibly have not acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips up to the final on Thursday sealed .
all three women have left themselves in the Assy@@ rian way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be their partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game @-@ life , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons &apos;s Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki b@@ anned both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and marked with Sam@@ son &apos;s energies , I noticed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on earth , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their perspective , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the land@@ lady &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am totally committed to it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who should choose to choose if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ es had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle did some great interest in moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who send inquiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ es chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have run Hay@@ d@@ for the rest of the game to the bench as he lost a Ger@@ angel , as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League conver@@ sions at his first P@@ unt Return , on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula made his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt Return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of having ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ es publicly during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ pen@@ ed to him his rejuven@@ ated F@@ ang and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first feature of Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive austr@@ alian extraction had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ es left the game field and told later the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse off in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that is occurring now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne compar@@ ably the car@@ vers with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 , when a passport is held at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Queensland .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters are demanding because of the high wave of refugees , the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ cl@@ au@@ sur in Big Wall@@ stadt at Bay@@ erns landed in front of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when it is not appropriate for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ e@@ av@@ als in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the regional budget of the Free elec@@ torate until Friday at the Lower Apostolic Church .
actually , quite other main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course the topic Asyl@@ um is to be super@@ imposed , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
Ai@@ w@@ anger asked the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it fails to go , we need to stop the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seekers want to push the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of this , Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative agents who are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new Asyl@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent with federal states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we strongly believe nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be more hand@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the local government shall not fall under the table under the table .
a long @-@ standing br@@ enner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ s@@ Minister Ludwig Henri Spa@@ des ( CS@@ U ) has started off &quot; Mittel@@ stage plus , &quot; in which an extension of the secondary school level will be tested by three to four years - as a result , it takes again nine years until the final exam .
but that goes not far enough .
&quot; the theme G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ tics who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is needed .

the investments in the future w@@ afer technologies and the focus should be paid on the machine lines .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shoot
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal when the police rubber bul@@ lets appeared in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday .
the violence broke out in the office evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , approximately 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , guiding district apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of a police station , taking some of you stones and bran@@ db@@ om@@ bs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have inserted po@@ tions and then moved into the air before they pushed back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the applied rubber bul@@ lets , known by those that they can kill , but are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate produced .
the debate was the last in weeks violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed under the proposed new constitution to influence their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal , by the ethnic group of the Th@@ é@@ ro , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police forces , were in violent conflicts since 10 years .

working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lators accelerated the trial after the devast@@ ating earthquake that had been killed in April thousands of people .

under the pressure of the project Cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , which prec@@ eded the Invest@@ ors and the administration of secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends of the system @-@ building management in the offensive : &quot; we do not have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours .
for months , the project has been around ten to twelve million euros for months in the discussion .
fierce reactions from the land@@ owners , who had come to the meeting , called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ land@@ owner and board member of the representations of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this becomes a huge block , that dominates all the other places . &quot;
moreover , he fears like several other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; since all the bus charges are coming , so that &quot; says Schulz &quot;
what exactly on the well @-@ acre site of the former host is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only we have to have a concl@@ usive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is still missing , the Beb@@ bed@@ plans are even more variable .

the donations are given to four charitable organisations offering assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on canvas , called up to 11 million dollars .

weight loss can be helpful for lightweight diabe@@ tic surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly crowded people with diabetes for weight loss inj@@ ure longer live than those that are not received surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert for weight loss surgery , which was made an editorial part of the new study in J@@ ama .
weight loss @-@ loss operations or obesity , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity have proved to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in people who are disease @-@ fat , with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan @-@ minute @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and upset stomach - to medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those committed to this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those that were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equivalent to 29 .
among those who subjected to surgical procedure , was at 36 % the diabetes are completely and in 28 % partly .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is achieved entirely only at one percent and in part with only about two per cent .
in addition , the results were with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and of the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar over the course of time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , write the researcher .
after surgery the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c sunk from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , it remained stable under about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced not the mortality in five years , so the guiding researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team under@@ went average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger rel@@ ays in BM@@ I ( 7.4 % vs. 5.1 ) and resi@@ des rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery to five years , there are evidence from a study of serious people in Sweden that results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine .
in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people who subjected to a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried the conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage to survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said , it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 , which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without any increase risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone lied that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they &apos;ve accumulated these genetic changes , which have joined their body with obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love @-@ story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is now growing into Bell@@ et@@ r@@ alism : a young woman , too popular and un@@ sigh@@ tly , after years she met the boun@@ ty of her youth , and this fell in love with her .

in addition , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ killed readers , because it performs in Lang@@ w@@ eiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide asked to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of en@@ during refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that is dedicated to ethics .
he asked that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be confronted with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he emphas@@ ised that the reaction of West European countries is indeed admir@@ able on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria efforts to tackle the crisis , he emphasized that it is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have long @-@ term solutions to think about how real peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented by George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and introduced that the violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
I have expressed my che@@ at in a letter to President Bush in September 11 , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he placed violence and this has reck@@ oned off the consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hand infection through children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ins Centers in the US report about a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve that swal@@ low alcoholic fer@@ dis@@ infection , such as Georgia B@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia B@@ ison Center , rose the cases of revenue of hand @-@ infectious agents in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ft@@ control centres will report from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ants can pur@@ pos@@ ely drink , while some do it to impress their friends or for a mut@@ u@@ sal in social media .
videos on YouTube show how adolescents disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth water to have a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be pro@@ oted by attractive jets of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ted .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange trees that are very appealing for children .
hand@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children can lead a few dri@@ ps to the alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ch state in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not let gor@@ ck whis@@ ky around , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children get there , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of to straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ sor sides at school was brought into a p@@ unch for treatment .
her blood non @-@ concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that is deemed to drunk in an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ing doctor who treated it in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah gave her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors talked about night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of deer trau@@ ma , since the girl fell through the alcohol and came across the head , said k@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or ger@@ m@@ ect@@ ars and to store hand@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
on alcohol det@@ oxi@@ fication in addition , some dis@@ infection with fat@@ ality were also connected .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario in the gor@@ ges of hand@@ dis@@ tics , which enth@@ used an toxic , not de@@ cent@@ red ingredient .
employee of health authorities suppose that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which has been noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; brick to poison@@ ed &quot; as they submitted anti @-@ bacterial products around the teaching area , &quot; said it a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand@@ de@@ des@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iles it from their room .
the police considered the conc@@ er@@ ted plan as &quot; chit@@ chat &quot; and recorded trans@@ disciplinary action to the school authorities .

there are rum@@ ors about Celtic Glasgow , what was spontane@@ ously settled by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare for the confrontation with Dutch leaders .

the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation @-@ player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest to Celtic because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank .
de Bo@@ er , currently a mess@@ enger for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no high@@ s of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the leader@@ boards .
you will speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not just the men in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will revol@@ ve the things swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef vibr@@ or , turning things down .
after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aberdeen , which now stand at the top of the table with five point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we do feel like this - but we must go on .
we really need the support from Celtic people because that makes the player better .
now to be together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK there is a total of rising .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from 16@@ ,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom increased in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s employment rate of 5,@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the office for National statistics ( ons ) demonstrated .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell over 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4,@@ 0 percent throughout the quarter - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be witness@@ ing a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except in late legal intervention , I will look to see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a viewer gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip will be executed by the tox@@ ic@@ am .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was done for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I vo@@ iced .
when the day closer backward , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I voted , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists should see directions in the United States , and since often more applicants are available than places , a macro@@ sc@@ opy will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courses from 12 to five .
who is selected , the will be watching hop@@ elessly .
I cannot do it .
I would like to sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone numbers and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we are laugh@@ ing much when we speak .
the imprison@@ ed authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a scholarship to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of conscience as he wants it , and you get access .
I describe myself with it .
she dre@@ amed that she &quot; It could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I did .
I do not want to go down here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty to be a benefici@@ ary in deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a de@@ ath@@ lete .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters that you can turn to that for this purpose .
what you will get from me is what it means , a man will see an unnecessary death .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to be about walking around and I want my owners think I &apos;m trying my best for her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they begin thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be more coach .
I will be considering what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to sp@@ y his stable way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the eigh@@ teen months of Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will , if I am asked - and offered him an employment in my stables , to provide information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they certainly should believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to summar@@ ise me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , am@@ ber president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ad , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I consider that to be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L sol@@ ves and do maybe people outside trainers who are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and shut me off , and I have no doubt that what I tell you are thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ ct@@ ations levels of the Train@@ ers have been buil@@ du@@ red with Li@@ dar@@ i during the long time , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license on the table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ trained master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , drew the week@@ day results &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been worn on the horse , which cl@@ ashed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees is mist@@ aken mud for the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been the day for yesterday so that what was so .
but it also had such a race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who put these rules don &apos;t know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you have to go far , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
man after C@@ urs@@ ed were arrested
on the weekend the police have arrested one man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driving cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was shipped with the helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries , after being hit by a car on the Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley .
the police said , the mot@@ orists continued to stop without stopping , in order to help the last driver .
on Monday a 50 year old man came from Nath@@ alia to police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged because of cur@@ sed and signed Hil@@ fel@@ ine and due to other transport matters .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y beat against ri@@ vals for cont@@ act@@ ments to ring battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y is critic@@ ised the Tac@@ x of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said to have allowed the arbitr@@ ator to the Storm players &apos; Ring@@ straße &apos; with his team during the high Storm winners in the qualifying session in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett has made an un@@ disgu@@ ised statement at the Storm team after its team pushed the Final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two @-@ Queensland version were not &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the crew of its team and said that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team express him confident because they were worried that they were worried about getting hit by the Storm team .
&quot; that &apos;s up over and over again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring@@ es than they threw us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing at our defensive system or the techniques . but for the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es about a real emphasis and this has provided for us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore most likely not to lose acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s funny , as this emerges again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked Bas@@ enn@@ ett idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon takes the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne says of exciting football .
he is compared to his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; says Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a te@@ di@@ ous team and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce about it .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
that is the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them like this .
I need stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they have not thought of us than it was about the big games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher earnings than the game Bron@@ cos for co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and no points do something ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the maps .
if they mention us means we will be able to meet them in a phase .
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the Pre @-@ finals in the A@@ AMI Park . the ticket sales begins on next morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ refundable deposit on drugs
a man who may possibly pose a life @-@ long punishment because of his trial , to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that was turned to Queensland , has been released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of Dro@@ ge on the yacht Sol@@ ay found in South America through Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he joined his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that he attempted to possess the total amount and that in the café might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter f@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the Court on Wednesday .
in the trial of law , he lied the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and Sti@@ ef@@ ood had a deposit of 200,000 US dollars as security offered together to achieve its release .
&quot; following the reading of a hand@@ some explanation of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of $ 200,000 dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ f@@ agan .
but this alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from going out , not to appear .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security , under the conditions that he p@@ ushes his Australian and his Serbian pass that cuts each day at the police and turns at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 on Karlsruhe : leadership made apart
at a rear @-@ end case with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe the Tuesday evening a lor@@ ry driver has been badly in@@ ju@@ red .
two of the three trucks were slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver spot@@ ted it too late and tried in vain , to ste@@ eping the last moment to the left as the police rus@@ hed .
the leader of the accident @-@ causing damage completely apart .
the driver was seriously wounded in a hospital .
the A5 @-@ run between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was fully locked for six hours to 2 pm .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg , phone of girls , to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl , while it was asleep in an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent paintings of children which were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , the confusing message was found and al@@ armed immediately its mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five photos , analysed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg fav@@ oured the officials how he would have done it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a polic@@ eman to be a polic@@ eman , to terri@@ fy them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors E@@ lig@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction to sc@@ are people to sc@@ are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are a polic@@ emen .
he was asked for his conversation with the unknown person that sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to l@@ ure it .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drank , and said , he would like to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and at the top of crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confron@@ t@@ ted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the indic@@ tee computer and Play@@ station used to talk with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , found himself as guilty as the indictment , un@@ decent pictures of children on 14th June last year , failed to have exp@@ elled against the conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear to be issued before a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General attorney S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg is not published in the register of sexual pro@@ secution , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in his understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael noted whether the verdi@@ ct until October is to receive background reports about social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted to this event but has been kept in provisional custody for hear@@ ings to others .
it was still taken up prior to the date of the judgment into the directory of the sexual pro@@ secution .

the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is one particular movement in the comp@@ acts of life , which is currently especially well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially high : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registrations were passed on in August at this segment only in August .
this is reflected also at the IA@@ A ( publication of 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars are introduced this year especially for new compact models .
one of the biggest demands for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be standing at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
thus , the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra is also not to be much more expensive .
Opel sets out an entrance below the largest competitors in the VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current A@@ stra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
in addition , H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 horse@@ power to which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder engines count .
unlike the main competitors in the VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra is initially only one fifth .
as a second variant I will follow at the IA@@ A in the spring of the com@@ bi .
and what will be up next to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A yet to new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is the fourth generation of its A@@ stra @-@ competi@@ tor in the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is done exclusively as a five @-@ person in a conventional and one @-@ stressed physical GT @-@ version .
in stores the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
here , the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model is given a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 HP or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates in Frankfurt its world premiere .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on OE@@ Ms under 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square feet cells are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel that was accommodated in a small cell every month .
because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners have to be entitled to financial compensation , if they are housed in small cells .
this has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
sufferers may even blame the judges if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
that was an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in the judicial area in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toil@@ ette was spacious and not separate .
after that , the man , who under the pass of his pass was now on an open foot , had been displaced in a larger cell .
his head of his ministry was ad@@ missible because of the un@@ worthy arrest of the country in Berlin .
yet the Constitutional Ju@@ dge took up the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al in Berlin and re@@ directed the case for renewed examination .
you see the man &apos;s dignity in@@ ju@@ red .
Chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the survey period only a few days of liability for compensation shall be decisive , be a compensation sentence given to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ miss the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber must now be given the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
they first spoke in April of an in@@ mate , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
the human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi @-@ capacity of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , in addition to an in@@ mate in a parall@@ el@@ apse in November 2009 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decent accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was held every day from 15 to 21 hours a day from 15 to 21 hours in a like manner in the Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pr@@ isons have come over in the last weeks as well because of missing those in the head@@ lines .
prisoners are therefore always enclosed for 23 hours , the aggression going up , even to bat , it should have reached due to the tense situation .
after information on the judicial system , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of offspring of young people , 19 should fall away 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a tremendous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what will be to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say to you again and again : we can do that and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
following different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) annually - and over the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 flats ) .
dramatically is the lack of living space but above all in affordable housing objects : annually 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are out of the rental shipping , and to apply these especially convenient apartments to refugees too .
federal mini@@ ster@@ in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing annual would have to arise and the federal government should invest a promotion of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree to scientists and federal mini@@ stries in that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute of Labor market and occupational research , it is expected to be 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asking for their qualifications to help them get started , critici@@ zed Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is decisive whether they find their work in Germany .
labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception , but also for self @-@ esteem of the migrants , &quot; says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ us@@ hardt there has been a political shift : from work ban for refugees to recognition of labour .
while formerly an employment contract offered for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residences in place of asylum seekers .
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - mostly the view asser@@ ted that refugees should be able to access the labor market faster .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labor market are missing German knowledge .
until now , there is still no ri@@ cher on general and vocation @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the structure of the networks is therefore a view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Arbeit@@ sin@@ tegr@@ ation .
the Berlin @-@ government @-@ government has found that only a few refugees will give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the star@@ red parents it is only once all important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ libr@@ is , spokes@@ person for youth and family in Berlin Senate management .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase rapidly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - e.g. by allowing more specialized schools .
in the countries students are being prepared without a German knowledge of welcome classes on the lessons .
but they will not always be taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case of the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or thought @-@ conducted studies - the only exception has been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio @-@ oriented refugees could be facilitated at the University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or d@@ ots do not receive any services after the asylum seekers law more , when they start studying .
the latter generally receive no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they will not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ v .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for up to four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from January 1st , 2016 .
also this financing gap must be closed but St@@ effen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many refugees , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should expose the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches to develop into a new state @-@ religions .
the establishment of a Islamic @-@ welfare association , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a way , representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact person to agree with the state in many areas and to give him some control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Bank of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts may also be drawn into Germany .
those who wanted to do such conflicts in Germany have immediately tried their right to stay in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a major theme in the whole of society in the future .
so that the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ passed decade , anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is approaching very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ string @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist moti@@ f systematically ign@@ ited .
equal opportunities for all : what Mig@@ ran@@ gers &apos; organisations and stakeholders &apos; interest are going to demand a long time and for the international agreements such as the counter @-@ terrorism conflict in Germany , will have to remain peaceful in the coming years , when the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
generally Germany may be able to supply the previously expected refugees with medical , President Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacities are concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , extra money must be included in the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers must be equ@@ aled to the registration health cards at the same time .
brought services later to the federal states could be settled .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able so many people look into the catalogue of the product , which sees the asylum @-@ growing law .
otherwise , doctors in particular make the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin science scientist The@@ a Bor@@ ders have proven that migrants are worse affected by their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practice , interpreter would have to be adopted , she demands .
a lot of refugees would also be helped with even more universal ap@@ pr@@ is@@ ers in the emergency @-@ patient out@@ ne@@ es .
and with another diagnostic view .
under refugee wheels , there might be much more un@@ treated disability , and with the young people it is about HIV education .
with the partial other illness images , German doctors would come from their education , but well as Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking the paras@@ ite or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as regards the trouble @-@ Sh@@ ort@@ ages , be even relief through the refugees even mi@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have had a highly developed education system , several refugees even doctors .
in order to practice it , however , they must take up their qualifications and perhaps once again plac@@ ements their qualifications .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany according to the estimates of a bundle of cancer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is mentally ill : most suffer from an post@@ trau@@ ma @-@ related exposure or depression .

Man@@ ege invites for dre@@ aming
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus itself takes back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group to the B@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veterin@@ aries and its unique entertainment .
now the Circus loads in the Man@@ ege on the tile castle was@@ en for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine having to live without my Circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie pro , Tyrolean and J@@ uni@@ on@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current management of Man@@ sion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since more than 33 years the cir@@ cus in the hands of the family has always lived .
the gift to the delight is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we consider it important to take away the people from their everyday life and take them to a totally different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 year old J@@ uni@@ on@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ o@@ gen@@ h@@ tail with world @-@ city flair &quot; , &quot; said Director Reinhard Mar@@ t his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 mile long tour this flair can now be experienced .
the program of cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
distinguished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v c@@ low@@ n family attracts the audience with wi@@ t and charm in their spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their handicraft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to get into the cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
their humor@@ ous art at the M@@ ast shall conquer women &apos;s zen in the storm .
except by numerous sal@@ mon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus are also comparable with finger@@ tips and laughter .
balance the balance on a bul@@ let ?
for He Yuan is no problem .

60 votes from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brig@@ itte
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie ou will also take a stand : &quot; it is not good to our animals , it is not too good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged g@@ oni@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called lovingly called , is after the possibility of any wish to be read from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
feel the animal not comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
the top@@ most commandment is : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family pro@@ ud@@ ly pro@@ ud@@ ly .
the two animals have lived eight years into a enclosure and nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo da &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told Brig@@ itte . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but this is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus .
all visitors might be part of it for every visitor .
&quot; one is for sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie rehear@@ sed : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are all with whol@@ eh@@ e@@ art@@ edly . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa oldest leader , fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remains unlimited , but the video of the case became quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also perio@@ di@@ fied by cont@@ en@@ tions of the opposition , that they would receive anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the hint of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ates by Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they had booked him and interrupted during his talk about the State of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven &quot; positions @-@ politician SMS messages can have received on their mobile phones they warned that Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es An@@ speech should distur@@ b .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalist to Mu@@ fork .
it war@@ ns the parliamentary members affected by the Parliament &apos;s immunity , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that of Morgan Ts@@ us@@ ur@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of re@@ organisation and savings in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and separate the computer &apos;s and printers business from his fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job market leads to a burden of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to derive the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is now stronger and stronger than it HP is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of shops that support companies during transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our clients around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and is concentrated on providing so far @-@ attained , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; as an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical installations and their Palo Alto region called the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring in order to cope with the recur@@ r@@ ence from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC @-@ producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech company , is the newest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform a better performance .
FC ar@@ senal captain Mich@@ el Art@@ eta says that teamwork in front of the game vs Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
turning out opposite to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it wasn &apos;t until September and when his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play on Christmas again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly be certainly uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had badly damaged the last season after a separate K@@ ou@@ fl@@ atter@@ ing and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not good healing .
it is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger is well recognized , there are the associated dangers of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
Inves@@ tigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ens in the last five seasons .
the broader image of ar@@ senal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were to have recorded most viol@@ ations .
maneu@@ ver accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believe that an improvement in the injury @-@ rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from a violation , you have a decent period , a time when you will strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lanes in the next Wednesday , and turning a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ un@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of N@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give to the players who need to get a little sli@@ der off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started during the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , being measured on the judge 2 : 2 .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from the past season with the Champions League of Monaco and will remain alo@@ ging with his management to lead the society into his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked with ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open , now become more des@@ perate than ever before , like su@@ icide , among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ not@@ ary prove .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more prevalent in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ atha Living Mis@@ er@@ esis ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ in@@ im@@ pover@@ ished life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim to question the culture in question that men are seeking to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ rep@@ ie@@ ce in the fight to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depress@@ ant symptoms fixed that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances for recovery impres@@ ses .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends too , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more social media communication , their focus on style on substance is often more important than the in@@ solvent of the answer than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to be strong , lively and successful , even if actually dominates the isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ic extr@@ ater@@ al values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing has been placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler hu@@ gs , moments at the soccer fans in cozy Ses@@ sions and the longing for R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely come back to explore fully their feelings .
as an employee of the telephone calls it told me : ... &quot; my in@@ audi@@ t@@ roll for people who feel de@@ pressed and seriously end@@ owed , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us will often not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come across with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer a more long @-@ time mechanics .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ der out@@ si@@ der status over the phone the people in moments of moments of despair may also help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you want to visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely rest@@ led scenery , why do not take your friends to have a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you &apos;re in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone can sit around in front of it alone , give it a smile and say Hi .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends will be in com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Mal@@ mo@@ an
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his right hand against Malmö .
di Maria is true at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to visit Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept the course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain began his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the prince park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally lifted up their lead , as Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ field at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes a strong start against the Swedish master as they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the past quarter results in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classroom of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later started in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents issues and relaxed easy , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t had one or two other gates . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris @-@ Team after his injury , which was on the weekend to hold on a 2 : 2 tie in his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was scre@@ ened in the fourth minute by Di V@@ en .
the Argent@@ ine wing pi@@ kes was referred to as the man , who can take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran in the Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defence , before he Johan Wil@@ and past beautiful in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a great win , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to achieve this level , joined with An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was aged with a five @-@ man @-@ defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field a severe opponent .
but except a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered a little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself got up sometimes , with some patches and bad results , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic alone in the first half , and then returned , after Cav@@ ani had put him after the restart .
nevertheless , he reported much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria turned into a screen@@ writer , which was past by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute .
the second gate finally came shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Fin@@ ero he had ended its sixth season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had put up a left side f@@ lange of Max@@ well .
it ended up all the thought that Malmö can come back in the game , and just a superb intervention of Wil@@ m from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before the substitute judge E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi could be a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ le@@ den , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league who did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fiers are not rich . &quot;
hat in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world@@ - and Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ s@@ add sport club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern stood obviously just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at that time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish Master , three times Po@@ cal@@ am@@ eger , four times champion championship winner , two times club champion , two times champion , a world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ t@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she won &apos;t be needed behind the scenes .
while a succession of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ broke the experienced actor Brown , when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives , and in regards to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it during the occupation of the film and not during the cast of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with loaded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! WOW . okay , &quot; as the comments of the act@@ ress from The Mar@@ tian &apos;s strength .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produc@@ ers Ben aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ er@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is be@@ aten by her white li@@ der .
the producer of De@@ ar White People was campa@@ ign@@ ing for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Director @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on resist@@ ed that her reg@@ ie will give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval over Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip expressing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain to her diversity - that is SO W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served as a 5,000 ret@@ we@@ et and 4,000 lift since its publication .
Dam@@ on Com@@ ments come at a time when exact racial or representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown has been killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide level of effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discri@@ min@@ ating practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince wrote a bet on the movement during the recording of the recorded albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent Mat@@ ter &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums now still have their meaning .
in recent years , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter released a statement and ad@@ ored as a response to the question of the Fox @-@ news @-@ personality Elizabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leader .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that was invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .

&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or life , &quot; said Isaac E . over his bunch of money .
as suddenly ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the director producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he first ended the itinerary , not any prize money .
after the rules the money is transferred to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he means a pen@@ ll about it .
he is just so fortunate to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad there is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same , if they had moved the roles .
America Ninja Warri@@ or was renewed for an apple season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played this part in Tuesday perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to climb inside a half @-@ half of Houston , for the second American League game @-@ card square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F Word so that it was hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ma@@ m .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support to scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) smote 6 times in 1 / 3 rate and made three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ pics of each game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
the des@@ design@@ ate tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three suitable matches and was in two of us , his first R@@ BI@@ s since the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had played four hits against the Seattle Nav@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has put the drums well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pil@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at his hand training ) , saw distin@@ ctly better from the bull@@ ring , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three of us in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play .
the training center Fiel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the setting with a double on the left field line .
Right Server of Aaron H@@ icks reached a mess@@ enger , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced with the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy shel@@ tered Wall , the only man who was faced with whom he design@@ ate ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drums Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ys the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w squ@@ hagen a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the closing run at the second caused by ph@@ ages the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
this was the major 27th times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a Double Play
after Detroit added to the end of the ninth grade to an Insurance @-@ Run , the Wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed gate , however , S@@ ano with three pitch for its fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the opening of the game from an even not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three of us in the first two inner strikes against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an who had been painted before the play of the viol@@ ability list , after being missing for a back one month ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning that I desired to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt confident when I started and noticeable that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they got the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ batt@@ ter , I gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game , who created a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z got his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the runner in the scoring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third which the threat ended .
the tig@@ ers placed on the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single by center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ osis for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not say very well , but he has got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found itself in a pitch in a pitch , and had no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ o@@ ver R@@ ange of A@@ J.@@ A@@ lig@@ an .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z exp@@ ired because of a violation of the throw @-@ school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid August on the vulner@@ ability list , due to a school period , is planned to be activated for the start on Wednesday .

Ischgl : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Scho@@ inger , maintains military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the more resol@@ ute thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago I was glad that the cup of a military participation in Germany has gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends before our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria monitored on the southern and eastern borders
after Germany Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian inner mini@@ ster@@ in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on the eve of the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary also no one will be sent back now .
also Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; stated .
the question of an agreement on which Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I already have agreed discussions between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
concrete numbers they did not call and dis@@ missed for talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary so called Bal@@ kan@@ en route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit meeting with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , EU countries do not have to agree on a common action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a new move to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the powerful refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal states more vigor@@ ously during the opening and distribution of men .
this league will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour discussion with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lining those people who were able to protect them , too .
but who did not have a b@@ bin @-@ eye view can also not stay in Germany .
this idea was expressed in the round impressive .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now be a &quot; huge power @-@ exer@@ tion . &quot;
thousands of des@@ perate refugees have now stuck in the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilomet@@ re border with Serbia in the night on Tuesday .
a few hours later announced the government in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country belongs different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g @-@ pl@@ ated footh@@ ills over Romania , she said Hungarian Secretary of State Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian Government condem@@ ns the Plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of men who had under@@ cut the fence .
in Turkey , too , thousands of migrants would like to report on the way to the Greek border .

the researchers put their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;

the expansion of the hidden ocean was however not clear .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
just 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Municipal President Ign@@ a@@ zio San was baptized in the park of the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of Rome alongside the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the study of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es were able to live for centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith .
with the place I become visible in a symbo@@ lical way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as depend@@ able s@@ cap@@ s@@ able .
his negative impressions took him to the historians point in his future fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated with his theses on the release of the United States of the United States .
hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main drives , the Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible painted .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and has been updated by Bi@@ bel@@ tex@@ te .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures now .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his whole personal interpre@@ tations on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects , this can quite be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar has worked at his Bible project for which he has met a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded are cycles that dedic@@ ate topics like cru@@ bil@@ g , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther Verlag in its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing company with its focus on artwork .
and there is above all the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post placed himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
he interpreted the bi@@ ds that were interpreted by the Ot@@ mar and so into the present , into current relationships . &quot;
the texts are like verbal mirror of aging painting .
immersed in the original Bible , they are between the original Bible , and one sentence of the artist who formulated his quite personal thoughts on the situation here .
the p@@ endant has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old takes twice as twice as deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately ou@@ trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ ud@@ der Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education already happened to the tu@@ b@@ by , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on to work with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to gain more significance in the fastest time in the fastest time : &quot; the perception of Wor@@ lds is now shaped by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being crossed out .
artists have a different desire and bliss to portra@@ y things .
pictures always have something mystical and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to allow the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cl@@ usions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they can be influenced , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post stri@@ ps on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like he understands his life with his pictures . &quot;
old have not given respect to the Bible , but rather to be chosen for him important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye @-@ level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ mail : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explained . &quot; emerged be a images @-@ bi@@ ble .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s house this work is an invitation to enhance his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Prin@@ ts - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X railway
made plans , place found , company instru@@ cts to create a circuit for a round course : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was already concluded .
failures in politics and administration offered for money , especially among the inhabitants who did not tolerate the railway .
so hills be@@ v@@ elled from the top , new place - now with the formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will come in October , the First council of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck can now be communicated to the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still going &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was then started without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the work at the former covered pool .
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to the application of refugees to 2019 and the Bundesliga team a clear sign .
the football has responded to the situation in Germany and secur@@ es its assistance in overcoming the problems related to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say in principle , that is nothing wrong with me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet there the State tut@@ to in Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could wish and want to achieve .
but the decisive course still needs to be the policy .
the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; about four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 pro@@ filing a clear sign when it will be on the left channel of Tri@@ kot@@ är@@ Heights , instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship of the sponsor ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &apos; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lever@@ kus@@ hima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ assurance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama everyone goes on , nobody is allowed to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football @-@ Bundesliga , no , we must use our energy force , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ast@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
for EM Quali@@ fication against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach approved the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license have started their own projects in their places , be great .
just as magnificent is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the German government has allocated 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .

the head of the head of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports , according to a fall of July the left eye .
during the accident at the St@@ airs in the House of his brother in the USA he had fallen after midnight on a water @-@ glass that he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; business week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , it was power@@ less , then has come out to the street - that he tells us so last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ w &quot; SAP @-@ founder of the H@@ asso Sass@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the conference meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Plat@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; job opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead to the software concerts .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually p@@ elt between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German company headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again if you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes were definitely sm@@ ashed on a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europe League .
the national @-@ player is also missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga as well as in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga team against Lever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach is open again : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his pro@@ genit@@ als on the Re@@ us position .
so , he announced a change on the door@@ keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller assumes the place of Master keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller has come for use in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el did however open .
with high probability he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ bi@@ ous statement by Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the final draw for the BV@@ B in the Europe League must be the target and keeps the field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l . &quot; this is Marco not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner upon the will of the German federal government in the shift of the car technological fron@@ trun@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure previ@@ ew@@ ed .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t was talking on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobile @-@ age age . &quot;
automated driving is going to increase traffic safety and make for less stress , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
the Concept Paper of traffic Department stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band composition and a fast re@@ level of broad@@ casting on digital listening .
in addition , the testing of new technology is currently being created on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no extra liability risks are allocated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany is to make up for example that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 hours .
the Federal Government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention so far only by people as a driver .
when automated driving takes on increasing the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
after one of the study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , it will be technically possible by automated driving on motor@@ ways until 2020 .
nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected shortly after 2020 . &quot;
the value chain in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site Germany appreci@@ ates the authors of the study by 20@@ 25 to around 8.5 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s Security Policy S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly defined .
still , the German self @-@ driving cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on AA first survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of the Germans have believed that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it , 31 per cent does not believe in it .
in France 21 percent of the surv@@ eyed said by 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a vehicle @-@ driving car .
according to a survey of digital A@@ coma , Bit@@ kom would only be able to agree with only seven percent , taking control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway could be present in the flowing traffic up to 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
good every fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances .
B@@ oll tells team@@ - and double start at Tablet@@ en@@ nis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will fight for current status in the title fighting from 25 September to 4 October only in single one .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; that is a huge loss to our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Con@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ ner during the EM @-@ Teacher in Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this stage on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing money in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner who runs the S@@ etz@@ ater@@ in@@ burg listing in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , reminded me of the EM of 2013 in Ro@@ iss@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Timo is also missing , and we have become the Europ@@ em@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be oriented towards us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ tran@@ e list . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mix of very great fashion show and a qu@@ in@@ figure in Gr@@ uss @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ette : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which can be qu@@ aint thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections .
they carry along the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as sta@@ ge@@ out@@ fits into the big star of the fashion scene - and thus , that he put up men in skir@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Citiz@@ stei@@ g on the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a lucky that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ öpf@@ er has changed his initial rej@@ ecting attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it because , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition said a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in the Canadian capital in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dres@@ ses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly still @-@ looking work of the man , who has written fashion history , without ever having completed education .
chron@@ ologically , the watch is not structured but it is a perfectly choreo@@ graph@@ ed overall art work , which was conducted for much effort : to fres@@ ise the dolls , for example a sty@@ list is engaged .
14 tons of material have captured the movers according to data from the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather tro@@ user @-@ out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
home meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier @-@ Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ous mo@@ tive Geh@@ versuche des Design@@ ers .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his t@@ ed@@ dy bears and dres@@ ses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a d@@ oll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dischar@@ ging of fashion he got himself later on .
he sto@@ le fashi@@ on@@ ings and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but later I bought it but of course .
he did not pay the model for his first own fashion look .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
previously it went to long nitrogen machines in and around chew@@ ing to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to blankets and sheer curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ els@@ jo@@ kes .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the initial hours of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze mode a greater role played , then it was pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional traction .
at all Bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which leans on past styles , a growing supplier .
anyone who doesn &apos;t have a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
we have already made half of all orders for us .
Mo@@ kl@@ ist Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
about 80 percent of turnover in the past 15 years were broken .
private business transactions and also the wholesale market is almost no more .
our products reach the customer on this path barely any time .
the dormit@@ ories are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and have been distributed almost exclusively via chains .
as well as export , current to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries also to score by environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer has been explained by the nitrogen industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we lead a quality seal , that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially tolerated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this is also true of the used materials . &quot;
diploma musician U@@ te Schmidt currently teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ pose some competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
this is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and establishments who need to think especially economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often makes it easy to use , in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , real textile design cat@@ i Re@@ uter inv@@ ests the historical sn@@ ail tip .
the machine p@@ ushes small kitchen to some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ s@@ und Championships in Bianca &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not start with the traditional plat@@ oons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow@@ shoe @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in a time @-@ consuming procedure they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially on customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and the surroundings and who want to mem@@ o@@ des the cultures .
I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends is not meant to be touching , but Disney is still driving on a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it goes according to &quot; entertainment Weekly , &quot; but not a new continu@@ ance , but a kind of continuation , which plays only 20 years after the first film with the magical children .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family Banks in times of the World Economic Cris@@ is in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins last more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director has already been fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI . urges the economy to open wider for the world
the economy needs to open wide outw@@ ard@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should devote themselves to improving foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Bank Group for deepening comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi .
the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity @-@ policy aimed at regulating the market controls , relaxation of the border controls , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the local residents .
after completion , a neg@@ ativity list will be created , which identifies sectors and companies that will not come into issue for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of significance , as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally appointed business environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the Company and make sure companies decide how they manage their business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China border areas will allow to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms to foster regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to open in the framework of a quote , public controlled sectors , other areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legal interests of foreign loans and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; to apply , allowing the requirements optimized and facilitates the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee its activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , also discussed during a session .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double @-@ eye @-@ value in rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for Mercury in large rob@@ ber@@ y fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate work paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial and environmental policy are passed with full power to Schw@@ ang@@ ere and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt due to the limits of the nervous system to large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; be lifted from one to two milli@@ gram of a milli@@ gram , depending on fish species .
already , large beasts are already so strongly charged with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still existing threshold , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in contrast to this all@@ ure@@ ment , the EU intends to watch the threshold values in other fish from the currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch confirmed this however as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller col@@ d@@ fish , like car@@ p usually are stres@@ sing so low that they already respect the planned maximum levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ ically is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one for the humans of high @-@ quality heavy metal , which is highly corro@@ bor@@ ated by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the German government war@@ ns that there are already small quantities of especially severe injuries of the nervous system .
the Federal Ministry of Commerce declares on his homepage with regard to the current top @-@ level , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; may not be expected .
Mercury is present mainly by the coal combus@@ tion into the environment .
the German coal @-@ power drives come out according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of Commerce of the Green Bundestag Bar@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ be@@ x more than six tons of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total in Germany consumed .
the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish , approximately in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; permanently and over@@ bound@@ ing , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; was cited in March of the paper .
last year Europe en@@ rolled warnings of Mercury in fish already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ ost system .
