Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe mal@@ ent@@ episodes and prevention of man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ee , in the past , in the past , applied in the past .
the injection solution is applied to fast control of increased lack or behavi@@ ours , if the oral medication is not possible by means of medication .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to inser@@ ting or the melting tray in patients , which are preparing the can@@ es of tablets difficulties .
in patients who use other medicines , as well as Abi@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affect the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances , which enable communication of the nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l works probably mainly as &quot; parti@@ tions &quot; for the receptors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also Ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lower degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the receptors .
since dop@@ amine and bi@@ polar disorder with schi@@ zophren@@ ia and biological disorder makes a role played by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , making psycho@@ tic or man@@ ische symptoms are reduced , and their recovery will be avoided .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , which occur to prevent symptoms , was investigated in three studies on up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was administered in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which compared to an increased accident , over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ fy and placebo over twelve weeks in a further study was assigned to the efficacy of Abi@@ fy and placebo . in another study , 160 patients were stabil@@ ised at 160 patients in which the Ottoman symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ector has been observed in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , which compared to the increased accident , with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ sis ) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients received on a standard scale of bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body is the melting tray and the solution for inser@@ ts ( up ) .
in both studies with injection solution , the Abi@@ li@@ fy doses were measured in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms increased as the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance Abi@@ li@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies were more effective than placebo .
for up to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented more effective than placebo for the recovery of Man@@ iso@@ episodes in previously treated patients and if it was also administered to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injections was reduced in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo in@@ feed and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( un@@ load ) , headache ( strain relief ) , headache ( strain relief ) , pig &apos;s disease ( increased storage ) , obj@@ ection and exhaus@@ tion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ mis@@ sibility , In@@ som@@ ing ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety disorders .
the European Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and of medium @-@ medium to severe adverse events in patients who had mostly man@@ oeu@@ v@@ ested against the killing of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or patients with metastatic disease wor@@ ms in bi@@ polar @-@ I error , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . , a approval of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of a new German@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and the prevention of a new German@@ ic episode of patients who had predominantly man@@ ische episodes and their man@@ orial episodes were shown on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , ir@@ respective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ zophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
in view of the bigger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be drawn into consideration , if clinical factors do this right ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the emergence of succ@@ essive disorders belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases following an anti@@ psycho@@ therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4 ) .
results of a epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance , there was no increased view@@ point risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was diagnosed with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( mut@@ an@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were no reports about the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
when using an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients , symptoms and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be drawn into consideration that the dose to reduce or reduced treatment .
if a patient signs and symptoms are designed to indicate a m@@ ns , or even clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics must be de@@ emed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was supposed to be used in people with cra@@ w@@ men in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in case that are associated with cra@@ w@@ men in relation to be applied .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ ic who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fi@@ ddle dosage , a significant correlation between the dosage and the response to undes@@ i@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , in some cases extremely well and associated with ket@@ ac@@ acia and hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em compression or death , was treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic ingredients , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no exact risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia @-@ related adverse events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic ingredients treated patients who allow direct delay .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ gon , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in regards to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
a weight gain will be generally used in schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar varieties that use anti@@ psycho@@ tics , which is known as a tribut@@ ary of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , or of a healthy life @-@ effects , and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system is required , if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is required in combination with alcohol or other centr@@ alised medication that is taken by side effects like Se@@ aling ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical trial of healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitor ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased by the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it &apos;s to expect that other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and parad@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have to be made from similar effects .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; E &quot; ) may be the joint application with highly effective inhibitors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l resulting in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you use the common administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibitors using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , potentially should not exceed potential risk of potential risks in the patients .
other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ prot@@ ease inhibitor , have similar effects and that should be similar to similar effects .
according to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ Inhibit@@ ors the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised at a dose of dose @-@ level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be ordered with an increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical trials showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl an / 3 @-@ method morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl ) .
people should be taken to dis@@ solve their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy , for treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to the inadequate data on the security and due to the inadequate response to the animal , this medication should not be applied in the pregnancy , because the potential benefit does not make the potential risk of potential for fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned about that , non @-@ dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on it .
the following effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under Placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the down@@ side effects are defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zophren@@ ia - In a controlled @-@ term study with 52 weeks of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) were treated with bladder , D@@ yst@@ onie and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operated dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ der@@ in therapy .
man@@ orial episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study , more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with lung cancer treatment .
in another study , over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during long @-@ term trial period of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medical differences .
impact of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kinase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ otor were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in connection with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , def@@ ensive cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality by older Dem@@ ency patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tions or inten@@ tions were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
if there are no information about the effectiveness of a h@@ emo@@ aly@@ sis in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that h@@ emo@@ aly@@ sis in treatment of a over@@ dose is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma proteins .
it is alleged that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ zophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I error occurs on the combination of a particip@@ ator effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and Ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ r receptors and a real effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an adequate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to Ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ders and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
for the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily , the Pos@@ it@@ ters Emis@@ sions @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ age dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the Fri@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 228 schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms reported Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to placebo a statistically significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ operated study , 52 the percentage of the resp@@ der patients who held a response to study medi@@ ated study , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ f dol 73 % ) .
current values of brass , which were defined as secondary academic targets , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate , showed a significantly stronger better than with half @-@ seater .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia , for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was a significantly higher reduction in the rate of cancer at 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ s controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patient response ) showed a minimum of 7 % increase compared to the baseline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy studies , more flexible dos@@ ages of 3 weeks with a branch or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed an increase of placebo in reducing the reduction in reducing care symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mono@@ therapy study , over 3 weeks with fi@@ ddle dosage , with a branch or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed significant effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active mono@@ therapy studies , more than 12 weeks in patients with a branch or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and an adverse effect that was comparable to lithium or Hal@@ f dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ omatic re@@ mission in Man@@ ie like lithium or Hal@@ f dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing care symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a re@@ mission phase , followed by a re@@ mission phase for more than 74 weeks , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo in response to prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly with prevention of a return in Man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .

there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female patients in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female patients showed no sexually @-@ dependent effects in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clinical differences on ethnic affili@@ ation or impact of the smokers to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose of patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to pull off the end of the liver .

in an O@@ lan@@ s controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( N = 18 or 13 % of evalu@@ able patient response ) showed a minimum of 7 % increase compared to the baseline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled Mono@@ therapy study , over 3 weeks with fi@@ ddle dosage , with a branch or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed significant effectiveness compared to placebo .
in a relative biological bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to healthy volunteers , the relationship between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 : a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ asis of female sulph@@ ate drug con@@ ju@@ gate from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has been determined as a result of the recommended clinical response rate of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( or in 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects have been observed , dos@@ ages of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the medium @-@ ste@@ ady State AU@@ C were observed at the recommended clinical response dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied to fast control of aging and behaviour in patients with schi@@ zophren@@ ia or in patients with German@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I error if an oral therapy is not attached .
once part is part , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be finished and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to minimi@@ ze the res@@ or@@ ption and minimi@@ ze the vari@@ ability , injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ amine mus@@ cul@@ ous muscle disorders .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may depend on the basis of individual clinical status taking into account the drug or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l indi@@ ct is indic@@ ative , see the summary of the medicine using to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tray or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inser@@ ts .
there are no investigation on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with aging and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different when schi@@ zophren@@ ia and man@@ orial episodes were caused by the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is necessary , patients should be observed in extreme sea or a blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations into safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution may not be found in patients with alcohol or Pharmaceutical , ( by inhibit@@ ing or illegal medicine ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was diagnosed with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( mut@@ an@@ emia , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional report on the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ness , changing of consciousness , and indications Inst@@ aller ( un@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ ats , sweat , and heart rhythms ) .

nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater than to the sole offering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) , in a study where Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) was intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and received intra@@ mus@@ cular ( 2 mg dosage ) .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ ag@@ onist F@@ amo@@ ti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid Blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant .

other highly effective inhibitors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibitor are similar effects , and that &apos;s similar to similar dose can be made .
according to the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 @-@ Inhibit@@ ors the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised at a dose of dose @-@ level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of Sed@@ ation was greater than compared to the sole offering of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following effects of adverse events occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the down@@ side effects are defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following effects of the adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as a result of placebo or clinical studies in clinical trials ( * ) , classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study , over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during long @-@ term upgrade phase , over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo .
a comparison between patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medical differences .
impact of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ phosp@@ ho@@ kinase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ otor were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
in relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in connection with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , def@@ ensive cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality by older Dem@@ ency patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statistically significantly bigger improvements in A@@ gi@@ bility / behavior disorders compared to placebo and were similar to hal@@ ogens .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study ( 24 hours ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar distur@@ b@@ ance and abnormal behaviour , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection was associated with a statistically significant improvement of symptoms in the symptoms of aging and behavi@@ oral disorders in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean follow @-@ up of the initial value on the PAN@@ SS excitement with the primary 2 @-@ hour point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe imp@@ act@@ ness , a similar effectiveness in terms of population was observed , but a statistical Sig@@ nific@@ ance could be observed due to a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1,@@ 228 schi@@ zophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .

in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ zophren@@ ia ( oral ) a significantly higher reduction of rel@@ ap@@ opto@@ sis was observed at 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ s controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ zophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , 3@@ 14 patients suffering from oral response rates ) showed an increase of at least 7 % compared to the baseline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of a bi@@ polar @-@ I error , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , partially due to Li@@ thi@@ er or Val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ therapy , the adjuvant treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , showed a significant efficacy in reduction of reducing symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a re@@ mission phase , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to placebo in response to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly with prevention of a refund in Man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after intra@@ mus@@ cular injection , 90 % greater than AU@@ C for the addition of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the medium time to achieve the maximum plas@@ mask at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the addition of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was done by rats and monkeys , and resulted in any direct toxicity of a target exposure after a systematic exposure of 30 mg ( AU@@ C ) , which were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and 5 times more than the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
in studies , according to intraven@@ ous application , after intraven@@ ous application has no safety relevant concerns after mat@@ ern@@ aler exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bit ) over the maximum human exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety assessment , toxicity and toxicity of re@@ productive toxic , gen@@ ot@@ an@@ cies , and for can@@ eli@@ zed potential , the pre @-@ clinical data has no special risks to recognize the people .

in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ or@@ ical re@@ rop@@ athy during the 2011 Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ or@@ ical re@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment is inhi@@ bit at degree 1 or 2 , and if the following cycles must be reduced the dose .
there are currently no enough data for the recommended dose of dose customi@@ zation in patients with mild to moderate loss of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies of clinical kidney function and there are currently no enough data on the recommendation of dose customi@@ zation in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data to im@@ itation and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ kel@@ ing statement by pac@@ litaxel which could have considerably pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other form@@ ulations of pac@@ litaxel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction , the medicine should be removed and a sympt@@ omatic treatment should not be treated with pac@@ litaxel and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ litaxel .
in the patients , not re@@ acted Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles are increased to the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ly number to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the throm@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ number again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in combination with Abra@@ x@@ ane in connection with path@@ ogens , cardiovascular disease are not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycline @-@ treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ lls .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be practic@@ ed with pregnant or women who have not an effective receiver , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ litaxel is invisible .
women compared to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is a reliable pro@@ li@@ tion method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is excited during and up to six months after the treatment of no child .
male patients should be advised before treatment over a sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fer@@ tility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side @-@ side effects like fatigue ( very often ) and dizziness ( often often ) that may impact on the transport and ability to serve the capability of machines .
the most common and most important events of the side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III trial of every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking major hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( 79 % of patients ) and was quickly sealed and dos@@ ing ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / d@@ L ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / d@@ L ) .
in table 1 are the side effects listed in conjunction with the offering of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight loss , elevated heart rate in blood , increased blood sugar in blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar in blood , reducing potassium in blood heart disease :

Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ sibility 1 The incidence of hyper@@ sensitivity is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
as these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and it was not established not a k@@ aus@@ al relationship with these events .
pac@@ litaxel is a non @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ substance which promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes and the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to in@@ hibition of de@@ oly@@ mer stabili@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale Inter@@ phase and the mit@@ o@@ tic cell functions .
it is well known that Alb@@ um@@ sis of plasma components are medi@@ ated in the endotheli@@ al cells as well as in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in in the transport of pac@@ litaxel was operated by the endotheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sit@@ ing transport through the GP @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor is conve@@ yed and due to the Albanian protein SP@@ ARC ( B@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) in a pac@@ litaxel accumulation in the area of the Tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is treated with data from 106 patients in two single @-@ infected studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparison study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( Abra@@ x@@ ane ) was given in the form of an in@@ fusion in 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion in 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ centre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , each 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pac@@ litaxel chemotherapy alone ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a registered general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had a visual met@@ ast@@ ers and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
only 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only receiving chemotherapy alone , 40 % due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and to the adjuvant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time by progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity from pac@@ litaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived a peripheral neurop@@ athy degree at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neurop@@ athy for use on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative toxicity of Abra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated , and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ litaxel to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute In@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was identified in clinical trials .
the drug process ( AU@@ C ) increased linear of 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analo@@ g@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , pac@@ litaxel and plasma concentration participated in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average sales volume of 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high capacity volume has a far @-@ reaching extract distribution and / or turn@@ tables of pac@@ litaxel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of pac@@ litaxel to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minutes In@@ fusion was compared to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 , in combination with pac@@ litaxel .
in addition , the clearing of pac@@ litaxel was higher ( 43 % ) , when compared to a solvent @-@ based pac@@ litaxel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher ( 53 % ) .
published in the published literature on in vitro @-@ vitro studies of human liver and tissues , pac@@ litaxel is alleged that pac@@ litaxel is the first line of 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and two smaller metast@@ ases ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value of 6@@ α @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ xy@@ yp@@ ac@@ litaxel was increased .
however , over the age of over 75 years , however , only a few data is available , since only 3 patients had participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was used at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected by 8 hours .

the member states must ensure that the shares will bring to the approval of medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug by means ( professional information ) , lab@@ eled and packing t@@ eil@@ age . • With simple images of correct application of the item acci@@ dental boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar to the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance ( also called &quot; reference &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood coag@@ ulation which could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications could not be possible in case of a blood trans@@ fusion , where an blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be launched under supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to let a bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or in@@ scri@@ min@@ ic@@ er@@ son , in order to get a reasonable guide .
in patients with chronic renal in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who received chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values are always observed in the recommended field ( between 10 and 12 grams per day in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / d@@ L with children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to check in the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered and iron ore should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or so that the body is not sufficiently on the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus increasing the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell , into a gene ( DNA ) into a gene ( DNA ) , allowing them to education on the formation of ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was administered at administration of a V@@ ene in a study of 4@@ 79 patients , which compared to a kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference medium .
all this study participating in this study was at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they were used either on Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in between the beginning of the study and the prob@@ ation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study that received the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with one of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in patients were caused by kidney problems , in the same size , as for those who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ L output of 12,@@ 0 g / d@@ L .
the most common side effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally can lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ olo@@ cation , headache , and water .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may vary sensitive ( aller@@ genic ) against ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed than injection of the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as more studies are needed to ensure that as an allergic reactions shall be triggered .
the European Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , the medicine has been a comparative quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which provides Ab@@ se@@ amed , is preparing for medical experts in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the medication .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce medicines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , approval of the marketing authori@@ zation of Ab@@ se@@ amed into the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m My@@ el@@ om , who received chemotherapy for chemotherapy ( for example the cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ or@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available ( 4 or more units for blood in women ; 5 or more units for blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blo@@ t , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro@@ or@@ tho@@ tics in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion compensation is expected .
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ors .
the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ L ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pap@@ er@@ ical patients where the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration was between 9.5 and 11 g / d@@ L ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mpt@@ omas and fol@@ lic@@ ations can be different from age , sex and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical response and illness is required by the doctor .
a rise of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ es by more than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally at a patient with individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values above or under the hem@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target .
in view of these h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ular vari@@ ability , it should be tried to reach a corresponding dose of dose management , h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ L ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is greater than 2 g / d@@ L ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent H@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is 12 g / d@@ L ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia , is applied .
the current results indicate that patients with initially very low hal@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may be higher frequencies than those who initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present results indicate that patients with initially very low hal@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may be higher frequencies than those who initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
initial dose 50 % / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose rate of 25 i.e. / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired objective is reached ( this should be achieved in steps from at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mpt@@ ome and - follow @-@ up of these patients depending on age , sex and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical response and illness is required by the doctor .
in view of these h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ular vari@@ ability , it should be tried to reach a corresponding dose of dose management , h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 10 g / d@@ L ( 6.2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ L ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the patients should be monitored to ensure that Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ es@@ thetic symptoms , is applied .
if after 4 treatment weeks of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in order for at least 1 g / d@@ L ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the rate of recur@@ rent value , the dose of 150 % / kg times a week or 450 lbs / kg per week / kg each week .

if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is &lt; 1 g / d@@ L ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , respectively , compared to the initial value , is an appeal to the ep@@ o@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy un@@ likely and the treatment should be broken off .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ valence of ≥ 4 blood contamination is required , should be used twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ors program , so far from the start of the se@@ amed treatment of large iron reserves are available .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 pounds / kg of Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa once a week of three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) should be given .
here &apos;s Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 l / kg every day before the day before surgery , as well as 4 days directly after it was immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis hose by a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cook@@ ery solution to rin@@ se the hose and a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who received treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ rob@@ la@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should no defect or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ th@@ rob@@ la@@ stom@@ a ) .

in patients with sudden load loss , defined as a reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( 1 - 2 g / d@@ L per month ) , if the usual causes of in@@ fusion ( iron , fol@@ dable or vitamin B12 deficiency , alkal@@ oid to@@ xi@@ k@@ ation , infections and inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the exchange rate is normal , if the an@@ emia is normal ( i.e. the risk of recur@@ rence or leu@@ ko@@ cyte ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data for immuno@@ therapy at sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with renal an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic renal in@@ suffici@@ ency was not exceeded in the maintenance therapy , under Section 4.2 recommendation of the limit of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in @-@ target concentration .
clinical trials have been observed in clinical trials , while ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) was observed with a ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ation target concentration of over 12 g / d@@ L ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit , which is attributable to the addition of ep@@ ox@@ ins , if the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ration may be increased to the control of an@@ es@@ thetic symptoms and prevent blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause , as well as men .
it is applied in patients with a high cargo ( bone out@@ breaks ) , including in patients who have suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip as at H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changed the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ ctive should be able to receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in an mus@@ le .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , which occur in three days after the in@@ fusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pped similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta only has been prescribed by doctors , which have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta same is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material used in Z@@ omet@@ a .
in the first trial , nearly 8 000 men were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of verteb@@ rates and hip fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who have suffered a stro@@ kes in the number of fra@@ c@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which builds a bone sub@@ distance ) or at least 75 % compared to the baseline value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ ra@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hat@@ k@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to placebo .
in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ ctive , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are often in less frequently .
Ac@@ la@@ sta cannot be applied in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or one of the other components .
patients with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s risk of kidney disease , reactions at the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers ( die from bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta offers explan@@ atory material for physicians to use the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar materials for patients who explains the side effects of the drug , and it should be noted when it should be aware of the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Europ@@ harm Limited a approval for the establishment of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

the patient information package is scheduled to include : • The pack of contra@@ indications from calcium and vitamin D , reasonable physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann to medical or nur@@ sed aid .
treatment of Oste@@ opor@@ osis • In post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including in patients with a recently er@@ l@@ itt@@ ens low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men it is recommended by intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , the administration of the in@@ fusion was recommended by Ac@@ la@@ sta 2 or more weeks after surgery in the hip storage area ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors , the experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very close to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient allow@@ ance of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , ensuring for at least 10 days after the offering of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently er@@ ted low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 or intra@@ mus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering of Par@@ acet@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended to use as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adap@@ tion is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years , because data are to im@@ itation and efficacy .
acet@@ ate is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because this patient population is limited only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ cris@@ y is before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient amounts of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid response of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid on the bone um@@ bau can develop a temporary part of sympt@@ omatic mort@@ ine whose maximum is usually performed within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4 ) .
in addition , it is very close to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , according to a minimum of 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , ensuring for at least 10 days after the offering of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer patients , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atas for t@@ ooth@@ ed tooth therapy .
for patients who need dental handles , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ els in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the treat doctor should be based on treatment for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by offering of Par@@ acet@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of serious violations reported cases of atri@@ al fibrill@@ ation was increased by the Ac@@ la@@ sta was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 by 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis trials ( P@@ FT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ to Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibrill@@ ation ranged from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse effects of data are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid was used to kidney function as a decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of cre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( yearly prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , and a partial kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis about three years similar between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ad and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of treatment was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of the placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory heads , the temporary ambi@@ tions occur ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in a large clinical study treated patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get @-@ studies .
all patients receiving sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to prevent clinical fra@@ c@@ tures according to a hip storage and in the Mor@@ bus passport ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoi@@ dance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures according to a recently er@@ l@@ itt@@ t@@ inc@@ ture , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initi@@ al dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling , and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area was used mainly for cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in pine ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid .
many of these patients had indications for local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after sub@@ missions or other deriv@@ atives .
in its 7 @-@ 7@@ 36 patients oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ rose in the jaw area with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo in a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ mic , can be achieved by offering of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of Kal@@ zi@@ um@@ glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) have been observed in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ ing ( BM@@ D ) for 3 consecutive years with a BM@@ D @-@ T score for shr@@ ink@@ able as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any indication of an existing verteb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ometry of the body fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly decreased over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
acet@@ la@@ sta treatment patients aged 75 years and older had a reduction of 60 % reduced the risk of verteb@@ rates compared with placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta proved an equal effect on three years that resulted in a reduced by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of stro@@ kes .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the Len@@ inist acid , stro@@ lling and on the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hat@@ s by 6.@@ 0 % , the rate of lower than 5,@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius around 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ o@@ tic patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the Beck@@ enk@@ amm .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an improvement in an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone transplan@@ tation Speci@@ es @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosphor@@ us ( B@@ SAP ) , the serum and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) serum levels were determined in subjects ranging from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study period .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value and at 12 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value of 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 or intra@@ mus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ gage was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D treatment compared to the overall survival of the BM@@ D at all time .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment compared to an increase of the BM@@ D at 5.4 % in total sales and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ um .
clinical efficacy in men in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were randomized to 508 men and 185 patients was evaluated by the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical question@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical question@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated male compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was in comparison to the output of al@@ la@@ dr@@ on@@ ate compared to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ ser @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months , compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of Kno@@ ef@@ sta was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically , especially difficult to severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the alkal@@ ine mirror ( mean serum levels of 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ 36 age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid compared to intake 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months in two six months of comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decline was observed in pain intensity and pain in the comparison to the initial value of Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified at the end of the six months of the primary study ( on the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , when compared with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who received an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one of the 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that has been proved as dos@@ is@@ independent .
accordingly , the plasma jet quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum amount .
rapid bio @-@ phase disappearance of the large circulation with half hours of ½ to 0,@@ 24 and t ½ h to 1 / 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with an termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ era t ½ h in 146 hours .
the early net income ( α and old , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption of the bone and the separation over the kidney .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the total dose is recommended in the urine , while the rest is bound to a bone fabric .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in a decrease of 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no impact on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearing of cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ en@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic systems is un@@ likely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid will not be advoc@@ ate because it is no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , non @-@ dependent inhibitor of P@@ 450@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The renal Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid cor@@ related with Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it is reflected that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular kidney function to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adap@@ ting of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid .
as for heavy kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ert Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are not restricted for these population .
acute Tox@@ ic@@ ity The highest non @-@ cl@@ esi@@ al dose was administered at mice 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg .
during trials , retail outlets were 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , the 6@@ times of the recommended human exposure exposure ) , administered well over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ dition of influential .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxicity of patients with intraven@@ ous application was administered as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion was administered 0.@@ 25 mg / kg , administered at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ times of the human exposure exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C . ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulative ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure time , to@@ xi@@ k@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common use of studies with repeated application was a multip@@ ly primary haz@@ ard in the met@@ aph@@ ite of the long bones with almost all dos@@ ages , an findings and pharmac@@ ological effect of the substance is reflected in the substance .
the rats observed a Ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ity of doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ zer@@ ale ) abnorm@@ alities and such skel@@ eton .
at rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects have been observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxicity is 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest serum calcium mirror .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the preparation and conditions before the application ; usually , 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded 2 ° C until 8 ° C .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid is a representative of sub@@ distance class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone transplan@@ tation .
sc@@ ant@@ y blood mirror of gender hormon@@ es , mainly Ö@@ stro@@ mal , which is made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in a rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , who is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is done quickly , and a new bone material is used , which makes bone material we@@ aker as normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by inhibit@@ ing the bone um@@ bau again norm@@ alized , thereby , a normal bone of bone provides and thus gives the bones again .
if you are interested in dental treatment or any dental operation , you need to inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
for use of Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medication Please check your doctor , pharm@@ acies or care personnel , if you use other medicines if you use other drugs / use or recently taken / used , even if it is not liable to prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are using the drug , of which it is known that they have the kidney .
for use of Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages , you should consider that you may need sufficient fluid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The normal dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you from your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
if you have broken off the hat@@ s , is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta 2 or more weeks after surgery in the Hü@@ ft@@ av@@ al .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The normal dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta has been for a long time , you &apos;ll need to be one more dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exactly to follow the calcium mirror in your blood in the time after the in@@ fusion is not too low .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get de Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta do not fit you immediately with your doctor or hospital in conjunction with your doctor or hospital .
before the end of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls , take the termin@@ ation of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take advantage of your next medical doctor and discuss this with your doctor .
adverse events in connection with the first in@@ fusion will be very frequent ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and Schüt@@ t , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , enter the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is un@@ clear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta has caused these un@@ regular heart beat , but you should report your doctor if you have such symptoms when you get Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is also applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients ( body @-@ index @-@ index ) of 30 Kg / m ² or above ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² ) or higher ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² ) and beyond .
in addition , four studies carried out four studies on more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA were used compared to placebo as a supporting funds for the smokers .
too , the studies of the smokers showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was badly damaged on this application area .
the most common A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA study used during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were observed in Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper breath . ng The complete list of patients were reported to be used in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA .
it may also be applied in patients who suffer from an existing depression or related to anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , because it can enhance the risk of depression and would be able to thank them in a small minority of patients Su@@ izi@@ d@@ ge@@ us .

the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled trials for patients who were treated for weight loss and due to the metabolism .
if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the sales of placebo ( for undes@@ i@@ rable effects ( 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng At the evaluation of side effects , the following are frequently used :
very frequently ( ≥ 10 % ) ; sometimes ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very dense
in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons were administered from up to 300 mg , were observed only slightly symptoms .
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dys@@ li@@ pid demon@@ ic .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public this document is a summary of the European opening report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies included in order to gain recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is also used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetic medication ) can be applied . • It can also be used together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be adjusted using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest factor dose .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ae or insulin delivery , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ae or insulin delivery can be reduced to patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia ( low blood sugar ) ; the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ starch ( low blood sugar ) should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be upgraded in better , and the blood sugar level drops , which allows type 2 diabetes better to adjust type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ae , and in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ ce@@ y@@ elled Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which means that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ ational study , the effect of additional treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ae in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional treatment of placebo has resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study found in which the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin had been examined in 28@@ 9 patients , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to placebo in addition , compared to placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( reduction ) , weight gain and hypo@@ an@@ th@@ esia ( low sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabetic cure ( high definition levels - acid - in blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos decided in a mono@@ therapy as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in patients ( for patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a approval for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved , and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin delivery in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ compatible with insulin delivery or in@@ compatible in@@ compatible ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 , no data is available , therefore the application will not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are due to the presence of at least one risk factor ( for example , former heart attack or sympt@@ omatic heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight @-@ weight or eco @-@ interest , especially those with reduced cardiovascular Reserve .
the patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and Ö@@ de@@ me if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one will be used in combination with insulin delivery .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and a progressive mac@@ ular disease was performed .
in this study showed an increase of reports about heart failure , but did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme are as soon as possible again .
if a patient symptoms developed into a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , Ober@@ bau@@ ch@@ ew , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver enzyme .
the decision to be continued whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be res@@ um@@ ed until the preliminary results of the clinical assessment of clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ age dependent weight increase was used to stir up fat deposits , and in some cases with a liquid form .
as a result of a h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ alin ( relative reduction of h@@ mo@@ glo@@ omy by 1 @-@ 4 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ dynamics with 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitive therapy of patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral and triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ combination therapy , insulin delivery , the risk of a dos@@ cope of hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
after the market launch , with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , over an appearance or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabetic mac@@ ular mac@@ ular m@@ ms with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether it is between the taking of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the emergence of mac@@ ular a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms should be aware of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , if patients over disorders of visual reports ; a suitable eye @-@ examination should be drawn into consideration .
in a summary analysis of reporting from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the fra@@ c@@ isions @-@ incidence was 1,9 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a comparative study .

the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin ( a cy@@ to@@ mic P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the pregnancy test hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ ine , increased insulin resistance to the mat@@ ernity period and thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate sub@@ str@@ ates to the fö@@ al growth .

this lead to a temporary change in the lens and the breaks of the lens , as they can be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mic effect .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege over the three times the upper limit of the standard range is often similar to placebo but less than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ hard material .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ advanced mac@@ ular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure was at 1.6 % higher than in placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can be detected below .
since its launch , rarely more than heart failure was reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more than Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin delivery or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of messages from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in combination with comparative study group .
in the over a period of 3.5 years , Fra@@ c@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) treated with a comparative study .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work on activation @-@ specific core processors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ gamma ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ gamma ) , which leads to a increased risk of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscles .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as a single agent , has been investigating the time to investigate the therapeutic eff@@ ected ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be seen in an increase of 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin delivery phase , was assigned to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who received only insulin had been observed with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one group .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mono@@ therapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , limited to 18 weeks postoper@@ atively .
most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in the overall plasma @-@ tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de , and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol cholesterol and a small , but clin@@ ically significantly improved L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol cholesterol observed .

acet@@ ph@@ ane has been in total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as is no insulin delivery , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin delivery , insulin is in effective .
in the study , after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ce@@ y@@ elled Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
acet@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , which indicates that the blood sugar level were similar to the other human rights .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or another of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted to the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be given in combination with a number of other medicines that can be activated in blood sugar ( the full list is required to take care ) .
the European Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane increased over the risk of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S , approval of the acquisition of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .

in two to four weeks , a total of two to four weeks is still increased over 6 mg per day , the dose can be increased to 120 mg per day .
while the first treatment months may still occur , it is recommended that patients had at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of gyp@@ sum cases .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , since it was not investigated for these groups .

in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary accounts in blood during the last three measurements were below 6 mg / d@@ L .
in the first trial , 48 % ( 126 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg per day , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) showed a total of 120 mg of a total of 120 mg / s for the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart disease in the suburbs , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was effective in the blood of the blood in blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but it could also be a higher risk of adverse events in connection with the hearts and blood vessels .

patients with reduced kidney function , the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of renal cell carcinoma , calculation of the creation and monitoring of a ure@@ volume ) .
re@@ order from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in at Adv@@ agra@@ f at the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to a tac@@ kl@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the whole blood level in the whole blood @-@ level The dose should be based on clinical assessment of absor@@ bing and toler@@ ability in the individual case under subsi@@ dies of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ mirror @-@ controls .
it is recommended common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ view of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us also should also be changing to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dos@@ ing adap@@ tion , changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy or for the same application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing of Clear@@ ance , may require adap@@ tations of several days until the Ste@@ ady State is entered .
the data in clinical trials have to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the valley levels were not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tal@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is usually located in the whole time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 @-@ 20 ng / ml and in full blood transplan@@ ted patients at 10 @-@ 20 ng / ml .
while the following maintenance of liver therapy , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ t were generally used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts and other side effects that can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ seeing .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage , which should be experienced by the formulation of the regime under the narrow@@ er control of one in the transplan@@ tation regime ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , who proved to be proved compared to other immun@@ os@@ am@@ va as refra@@ ct@@ ed@@ ent , are not yet clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ ary formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
in the pro@@ phyla@@ xis use of adult cardiac transplan@@ tation and transplan@@ tation in the Kin@@ des@@ old , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ ary formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible replacement effects that can result in a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level in blood , and amor@@ tis@@ ation of clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable protein ( hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) , or other plant supplements during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with Di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a group of car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was called chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ b , which can also occur at Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid level and oils .
such as other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , the impact of sunlight , or UV light due to the possible risk of skin changes by suitable clothes or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who use Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us take symptoms for p@@ res such as head@@ aches , changed consciousness , c@@ amps , and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , should be a radi@@ ographic examination ( e.g. B ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ ok , ret@@ ardi@@ less , is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary molecules , lac@@ tose @-@ toler@@ ate , lac@@ tam@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ lac@@ t@@ ose @-@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of medicines or plant remedi@@ es , known as Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror with the same number of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining high concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ ko@@ tics like ket@@ ac@@ on@@ az@@ ol , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol , and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol , as well as with the Macro@@ eli@@ d antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ ycin and HIV prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal absorption .
highly do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ dnis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ dnis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute path@@ ogens , increase the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be reli@@ eved by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected by the metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lowered the clearing of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increasing the hormon@@ al exposure , is particularly careful with decisions concerning the action of action .
the results of animal did have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduced the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ one and can extend their half times .
the results of a low number of studies on transplan@@ tation testing is no indication that , under the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of undes@@ i@@ rable events on the course and the result of the pregnancy .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and plasma proteins in ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins may be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
in effect , the effect of mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects on molecular entities can be achieved by its binding through a cy@@ stic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment in the cell nucle@@ us .

in an interim analysis of a recent study , multi@@ centre study was reported through a recent study , a multi@@ centre study of 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

factors such as a low noise value and low protein concentrated , which lead to an increase in the in@@ bound of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the transplan@@ tation after transplan@@ tation .

the dosage and frequency of application , then whether Adv@@ ate for treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding is applied for surgical interventions .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood coag@@ ulation problems such as bleeding , muscle or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell , into a gene ( DNA ) , that it has been approved for the formation of the human power factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union &apos;s approved medicines named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is contrary to differently that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe and moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of medicine was investigated by the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
in the primary study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate has been awarded at the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood don@@ ors with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , head@@ aches , py@@ rex@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients that may be sensitive ( allergic ) to the human power factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components are supported .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approved a approval for the establishment of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dos@@ ing and duration of the sub@@ stitutes therapy , after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ esty , after the place and the extent of blood and clinical state of patients .
in the following h@@ äm@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ischen events , the factor VIII activity should not be reduced from the stated plasma concentration ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection of all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat , until the pain and the acute in@@ fusion will be eliminated .
injection of all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat the danger for the patient .
during the treatment of treatment , the frequency of injection and frequency of inj@@ ector is an appropriate provision of factor VIII , plasma coating .
individual patients can be different in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vivo study and different half @-@ time periods .
pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis use in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be applied between 20 and 40 % of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities should not be achieved or if the blood is not dominated by a reasonable dose , it must be carried out to prove a test , if necessary .
patients with high inhibitor is possible that factor VIII therapy must not be effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be weighed .
the administration speed should be exceeded after the face of the patient , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibitors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ular activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which was quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using the modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk that develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days at the biggest and of genetic and other factors depend on .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ posi@@ st@@ agen and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al development , the VIII product was observed on another re@@ combin@@ ant factor ( low ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibitors .
due to the rare listing of H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences during the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
one of the greatest number of patients were suffering from factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who showed all untreated patients receiving a higher risk of education , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not sto@@ cked ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) calculated using the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . postoper@@ atively ( 10 @-@ 14 days postoper@@ atively ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood coag@@ ulation was exciting during the period of time , and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on 15 . postoperative day .
clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE for 145 children and adults 2 were diagnosed with moderate to moderate to moderate H@@ äm@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and with A@@ DV@@ ATE group of A@@ DV@@ ATE with A@@ DV@@ ATE group ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .

in previously treated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE for factor VIII .
the immune response in the patients on tracks of contamination protein was analysed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statistically significant difference in both cases and a prolon@@ ged peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , however , no signs or symptoms on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .

based on the initial approval of the data available , the CH@@ MP has continued the benefit risk management functions as a positive result , but in terms that the safety profile is closely linked to the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has been on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is required for P@@ SU@@ Rs all 6 months , decided that the appro@@ vals for 5 years will apply another extension procedures for 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited ( CH@@ MP ) announced that the company takes its application for approval by Adv@@ ance for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the suburbs ( tissue , which combines the other structures in the body , and is based on it ) .
this is a kind of virus that can be changed so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
when the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been changed so that there is no copies of themselves , so that it can &apos;t solve any infections in human beings .
Adv@@ ance would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from which not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restoration DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored .
for Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company submitted data from a study involving a patient suffering from the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub@@ bau@@ d , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP answers the answers from the company to the question of the company , were still un@@ explained some questions .
based on the testing of initial documents the CH@@ MP performed on a day of 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficient that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumors benefits benefits to patients .
the Committee continued to concern regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and safety of the medication .
in addition , the company had not sufficient that Adv@@ ant@@ in is made in reliable manner , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patients .
the CH@@ MP has not been aware of whether the consequences for patients has to participate in clinical trials , or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ances .
&quot; altered drug @-@ to @-@ turn &quot; means that the tablets are so put together , that one of the most effective ingredients immediately and the other is released over a few hours .

in adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily as a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
duration of treatment should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the Nas@@ al loop ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be retro@@ fitted to the nose .
the main effective measurements were the alter@@ ations of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms , which were reported in patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
while the study carried out symptoms all 12 hours in a diary , and gave their symptoms in a standard scale , as it was heavy symptoms in the last 12 hours .
regarding the treatment of all Gras@@ sh@@ ell@@ y@@ mpt@@ ome , apart from the nose , patients who reported Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze income , compared with a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.9 % compared with 35@@ ,@@ 9 % in patients with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the swelling of the Nas@@ al loop has been observed , the patients showed a dose of symptoms by 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .

Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be used due to the error of data for un@@ thinking and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) not to be used in children under 12 years .
the duration of the application is so short as possible , and should not be continued to sound symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of applications at 10 days , since the long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin with the time .

about cases of heart attacks , heart men , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain , diarrhea , Hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations , mus@@ cular pain , cra@@ w@@ aging physical activity , above cases of liver infection and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver values also was very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for inser@@ ts ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml @-@ sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for loading .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which can be used in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children ages six to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was conducted in total eight studies of approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with aller@@ gien@@ ic rh@@ ini@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal rh@@ ini@@ tis and two studies on patients who were also asth@@ ma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the change in symptoms ( itch , number and size of the squares and performance in the days ) and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body is sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tray in the same way as the tablets and the use of children are un@@ thinking .
allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken up , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of ap@@ eri@@ us ( sympt@@ om scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared with a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in sympt@@ om was measured after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to placebo and 33 % in placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us can not be applied in patients who may vary sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or one of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe granted approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet once daily , with a or without a meal taken to linear@@ ize symptoms in allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ s@@ ist allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for use by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ edly rh@@ ini@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the existing disease @-@ run and can be brought after the symptoms of symptoms and can be res@@ um@@ ed with their recovery .
during the per@@ s@@ ect@@ edness of the rh@@ ini@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can become a prolon@@ ged treatment for the allergy period .
clinical @-@ clinical trials have been observed in clinical trials with distill@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ ycin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , when taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the most powerful effect of alcohol has not been reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied in very rare cases that it can be used in very rare cases which can lead to a impair@@ ment of the transport or the ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with placebo .
the most common adverse events which reported more frequently in placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth ( 0.8 % ) , harmon@@ ic ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common areas of head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ phase trial , which were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects have been observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ ones as well as the expression of the expression of the expression of the ect@@ onic molecule on endo@@ genous cells .
there was no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect on a dose of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg did not affect an effect on standard measuring sizes , including the rein@@ forcement subj@@ ective or the tasks that are connected to the fish .
in patients with aller@@ gien@@ ic rh@@ ini@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the lens of symptoms such as ni@@ esen , no@@ bles and itch , itch , itch , lac@@ ri@@ en@@ fluss , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as itch away on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal trade and Peru@@ vian , allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis , depending on the duration of the symptoms , also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent Rh@@ ini@@ tis and per@@ s@@ ist allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ s@@ ist allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as using the whole life of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively stimul@@ ated caused by seasonal rhet@@ oric in Rh@@ ini@@ tis .
in addition , the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria became one of the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the branches of different forms and chronic patients .
since the history of hist@@ am@@ pling factor is expected to improve des@@ h@@ at@@ ad@@ in except in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria also in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria and in other forms of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies , more than 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not mean anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the inc@@ lin@@ ation of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with placebo @-@ treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and wax of awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , which was comparable to patients with the general seasonal of the rh@@ ini@@ tis population was comparable to 4 % of patients receiving a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no indication points for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not identified , so altern@@ ation with other drugs are not excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bit not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies show that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate , nor a inhibitor of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .

in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the most powerful effect of alcohol has not been reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of the adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group as well as in the placebo group .
clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic Rh@@ ini@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with placebo .
in a multi @-@ stage study in adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects have been observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 have died for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ nesty therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
since the course of aller@@ gien@@ ic rh@@ ini@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children , the efficacy data from Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extracted in the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was not statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no extension to the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of bats compared to placebo .

as using the overall questionnaire of life on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased by seasonal allergic reactions in Rh@@ ini@@ tis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies , more than 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of squares and number of squares at the end of the first dose intervals .
the spread of this restricted metabolic rate was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ es ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study of sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years with aller@@ gien@@ ic rh@@ ini@@ tis , which has been restricted .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max also about 3 to 4 times higher with an additional half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
there are no suit points for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 flu in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people in the protection against the flu caused by the tribe of influenza ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vacc@@ ination that could cause a trunk to the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus which may cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ ine breaks out , if a new tribe of Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus is mentioned , which is easily spread of human being , because people don &apos;t have any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vacc@@ ination of the vaccine , the immune system recogn@@ ises the immune system of the Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus parts as a &quot; body @-@ stran@@ ds &quot; and forms antibodies against the vacc@@ ination .
as a result , the immune system is able to form contact with an Gri@@ pp@@ e@@ virus of this family &apos;s rapid antibodies .
subsequently , the membrane was then separated by the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which automatically det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ free ) and used as a component of the vaccine .
a study of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base was not sufficient for the assessment of safety of the vaccine candidates to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prec@@ inc@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical examination and further information on your treatment , please contact your treat doctor .
if you wish more information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medication for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which caused by the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ lowed through capsules as a solution for patients who cannot be taken as a solution , but it can &apos;t be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set until then , if the doctor has been tested , the anti@@ viral medication of the patient previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus that the virus is to speak to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , together with twice a 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r daily and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children aged four to twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase after body@@ weight is weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ quantity in blood with other anti@@ viral medication that HIV @-@ quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not healing , however , the cran@@ ial to the immune system , and thus regul@@ ates the development of the disease infection and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which were previously treated with Prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors .
with low do@@ si@@ zed k@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase , in 206 adults , which had taken the earlier prot@@ ease inhibitor , with other prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies of patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibitor had taken more patients with viral load below 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ generic ase also reduced the viral load , however , with the children who had been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibitor were only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults , which have been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibitor were reinforced with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ generic , viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as such as other prot@@ ease inhibitor :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibitor , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , to the most powerful waste of viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibitor :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Blä@@ omas ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may vary sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also be used to treat patients with cur@@ rant ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicine , which are equally de@@ hydr@@ ated in high concentrations in the blood of health .
in other drug abuse of patients who use A@@ generic , the risk of a li@@ po@@ dyst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ sis ( absorption of bone tissue ) or a immun@@ ologic syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by a re@@ covering immune system ) .
the European Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years across the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is taken in order to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have any prot@@ ease inhibitor .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved by &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since at the time of approval of scientific reasons , only limited information .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibitor ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
use of Am@@ i@@ avi@@ r should be taking into consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ degra@@ d@@ ability of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is reduced by 14 % ; therefore , apple capsules and solution can be used on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ metre basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If Posi@@ tive capsules without the strengthened addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses have to be applied at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors were not included in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the error of data to the un@@ thinking and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ cou@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function in patients with severe liver function in patients with severe liver function ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ do@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , containing cur@@ vy ( hypertension ) may be included , due to the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not to be one of the cure of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ism or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ generic , do not prevent the risk of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , an increased risk of severe liver abnorm@@ ality in potentially fatal course .
for the case of an active anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the respective technical information of this medicine .
patients with existing liver function , including chronic hepatitis @-@ active hepatitis , showed increased incidence of liver function under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ ot@@ ason or other glucose monitoring , is not recommended to make the potential benefit of a treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the out@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the absorption of the H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is a simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen due to increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For a number of medicines , serious or life @-@ threatening effects may cause such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of International norm@@ alization ratio ) , methods are provided for determination of drug concentration .
in patients who use this drug simultaneously , A@@ gener@@ ase may be effective for reduced plasma concentration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
because of the ability of metabolic interaction with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ es can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ on was given at the same time with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , the patients therefore monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ y@@ mpt@@ omas , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of a toxicity of a toxicity of a toxicity ( due to the high pro@@ cl@@ yl@@ col@@ onic solution ) , this formulation is contra@@ cting in children under a age of four years and should be applied with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be sold at the time 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the loop are involved ( see section 4 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibitor was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy were needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
B. higher age , and with authority - dependent factors such as a longer constant anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ äm@@ ophil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase of blood , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous h@@ mat@@ ome and Hä@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune response , the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ ist infections that leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ factor equ@@ alization is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ ity , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ do@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines , their active ingredients are predominantly to be connected to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ gil@@ ance , and can lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ating the plasma concentration by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibitor in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often undes@@ i@@ rable effects at the liver .
Johannis@@ ator ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) The Ser@@ um@@ ber@@ mirror of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r can be expressed by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with cur@@ rant agents ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um penet@@ rating ) .
if a patient is already cur@@ rant , the ampl@@ itu@@ avi@@ d mirror , and if possible to check the viral load of viral load and cur@@ rant .
a dose adap@@ tion for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ big@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which demonstrates the efficacy and evidence of this treatment .
in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered lower than if Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to measure the efficacy and in@@ eness of this combination .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trial for use in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , the proceeds from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the addition of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z is therefore necessary in combination with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibitor was low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibitor and existing limited data , the Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r .
if this medicine should be used simultaneously , it is pru@@ dence that Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be reduced because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma tube may be less effective .
if this medicine should be applied , it is pru@@ dence ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ logical logical monitoring is to be carried out as a exact forecast of the effect of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous offering of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fabulous , led to a rise of plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fabulous u@@ ine to 193 % and thus associated with ri@@ can@@ ine effects .
if it is needed for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fabulous , along with A@@ generic ase , is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ dd@@ ess at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical dates are present .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ ycin were not performed , but may be the plasma concentration of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous treatment of twice daily 700 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole every day resulted in an increase of 25 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole every day a day , which was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r was observed with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r every day .
other medicines , which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to exchange effects .
the patients should therefore be associated with toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibitor , it is wise that Ant@@ azi@@ da are not taken to be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as there may be res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the simultaneous application of Anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as an enzyme known as an enzyme known ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r can lead to a portion of the plasma concentration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r .
the serum levels of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , tr@@ fe@@ a@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ ate pin and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased 10 by Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , making the activity and toxicity of this medication .
taking delivery with A@@ generic , their plasma concentration may increase considerably and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibitors in combination @-@ side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ers , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
during a clinical trial in a clinical trial in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , the fluor@@ ot@@ as@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ate ( 4 times a day ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol was approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous treatment of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended that it is not recommended that the potential benefits of a treatment increases the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to H@@ MG Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibitor , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose changes have strongly increased by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , these measures are expected to expect a loss of plasma concentration at the same administration .
since Plas@@ mask @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibitor increased to my@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended in this product using Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r .
it will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ isation of the mirror , since the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ ycin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased to the benefit of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral bias towards Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ on ( see section 4.3 ) , during the same application of A@@ generic , with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ t .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibitor indicated on a possible increase in the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , around 3 to 4 hour .
if Meth@@ ad@@ on was administered together with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , the patients therefore monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ et@@ ss@@ y@@ mpt@@ omas , especially if there were also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical publishers , there are no recommendation to be given as the am@@ big@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose , if Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
in simultaneous addition of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies , an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally ratio ) is recommended because of the ability to decrease or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ coag@@ ulation effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrasts is not pre@@ dict@@ able , therefore also alternative methods for recipi@@ ents is recommended .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the treatment of A@@ generic ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medication should only be used for careful dis@@ closure of possible commercial for the mother in comparison to the possible risks of the fet@@ us .
in the milk lak@@ esh@@ ender rats , Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proved , however , it is not known to over@@ crowded whether Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is over@@ thrown into the breast milk .
a re@@ production study on impair@@ ment rats , which was administered by the collapse in the uter@@ us until the end of the post@@ war Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during the down@@ stream .
the further development of the descendants including fer@@ tility and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
un@@ aud@@ iting from A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
most of the associated with A@@ generic ase @-@ side effects were light up to moderate , expressed early in early and led to the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ generic , or another simultaneously on the HIV treatment of applied medicines , or if they are a sequence of the short@@ ened population .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which a prot@@ ease inhibitor was not treated patients of 1200 mg apple twice daily .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated in both acute and chronic lympho@@ bladder cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M near acute cells , and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 Rep@@ lication on humans are not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as were observed with prot@@ ease inhibitor - the described mutations are only rarely observed .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm is defined as the presence of mutations of the mutations of the mutations of L@@ 10@@ F / s , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 54@@ 94 / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with an increased risk of gen@@ esis ( resistance ) as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding relevance of certain mutations or mutations are subject to changes in terms of additional data , and it is recommended to attract the actual interpret@@ ations of the results of resistance testing .
based on phenomen@@ al resistance based analyses , clinical analysis systems can be applied in connection with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data of the activity of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibitor @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r , however , is generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cruise resistance between Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease Inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ l@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mutations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral load ( three of 25 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ates ) .

one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with im@@ weigh@@ ted virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I study were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
primary analysis presented the average output of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ le@@ gen@@ ial shaft of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml .
the Bel@@ eg &apos;s efficacy is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI was treated .
in recent studies , A@@ generic ase solution for inser@@ ts and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
a low dose rate was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of patients with A@@ generic ase , NR@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients had an anti @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10.000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ cs on these data should be drawn to the treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; of gener@@ al@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dos@@ ing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) are un@@ affected by the food intake , although the total dietary intake of the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l / kg ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large volume of volume , as well as an un@@ contam@@ inated pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in plasma concentration in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ interrupted am@@ big@@ s , which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ interrupted am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of the free active zones during the dos@@ ing drug in the Ste@@ ady State concentration on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has to be induc@@ ted or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ a ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the offering of ap@@ it@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure , as at adult dose of 1200 mg twice a day .
Am@@ mit@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than the capsules ; therefore , apple solution and apple capsules are not available on a milli@@ grams inter@@ changeable .
also , the renal Clear@@ ance from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney function to Eli@@ mination of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , similar to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous dos@@ ing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r mice in mice and rats the male animals were killed in male animals or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rating ) of the exposure to people , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ ement Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not excluded , and the relevance of that observed effects of people are un@@ clear .
data from the present data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as therapeutic application , however , showed little information about the acceptance of a clinical relevance of this findings .
in a standard batteries of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ oxi@@ dation tests , the bacterial lymphoma test , micro@@ core test rats and chromosome aber@@ ration on human peripheral lympho@@ cytes was Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver to@@ xi@@ ity can be monitored in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosphor@@ us .
previously , in clinical trials , no significant liver treatment was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ generic , nor after the treatment of treatment .
studies on the toxicity of young patients who were treated with the age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rates of treated with ampl@@ itu@@ avi@@ r animals as well as with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r animals .
at a systematic plas@@ ma@@ ine ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in people were observed , however , a number of minor changes were observed including Th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and small skel@@ eton changes , which point to a delayed development .
24 For A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the strengthened addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses have to be applied at A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application is to be contra@@ cting in patients with severe or lighter liver function in patients with severe liver function in patients with severe liver function ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For a number of medicines , serious or life @-@ threatening effects may cause such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of International norm@@ alization ratio ) , methods are provided for determination of drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the loop are involved ( see section 4 ) .
an increased risk of Li@@ po@@ dyst@@ rophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with authority @-@ dependent factors such as a longer constant anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with the associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ icin caused a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ gil@@ ance , and can lead to resistance development .
508 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) are administered lower than if Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dos@@ ing recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is not recommended to measure the efficacy and in@@ eness of this combination .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibitor was low .
if this medicine should be applied , it is pru@@ dence ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ logical logical monitoring is to be carried out as a exact forecast of the effect of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is needed for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fabulous , along with A@@ generic ase , is recommended to reduce the dosage of ri@@ dd@@ ess at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although not to be clinical data .
the serum levels of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , tr@@ fe@@ a@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ ate pin and Ver@@ ap@@ ami@@ l can be increased by Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , making the activity and toxicity of this medication .
during a clinical trial in a clinical trial in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day , the fluor@@ ot@@ as@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ate ( 4 times a day ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol was approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in simultaneous addition of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies , an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally ratio ) is recommended because of the ability to decrease or ampli@@ fication of the anti@@ coag@@ ulation effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,0@@ 35 mg of E@@ cle@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ rel@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r by 22 % .
this medication should only be applied during pregnancy , only after careful dis@@ closure of possible commercial for the mother in comparison to the possible risks of the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study on impair@@ ment rats , which was administered by the collapse in the uter@@ us until the end of the post@@ time of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the down@@ ward .
un@@ aud@@ iting from A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
in case of case of over@@ do@@ cking the patient on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ fication ( see section 4.8 ) is necessary to watch the necessary measures necessary .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated for both acute and chronic lympho@@ bladder cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lympho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ ration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0,0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M at chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .

based on these data , the treatment optimization should be drawn up with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ling &quot; of gener@@ al@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ interrupted am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of the free active effect during the dos@@ ing drug in the Ste@@ ady State concentration on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has to be induc@@ ted or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ a ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the renal Clear@@ ance from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a kidney function is low to Eli@@ mination of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r mice in mice and rats the male animals were killed in male animals or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rating ) of the exposure to people after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r .

studies on the toxicity of young patients who were treated with the age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rates of treated with ampl@@ itu@@ avi@@ r animals as well as with Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r animals .
this results can be noted that in young the metabolism is not fully re@@ designed , so Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibitor ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting was not used with PI pre @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ degra@@ d@@ ability of Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is reduced by 14 % ; therefore , apple capsules and solution can be used on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ metre basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should consider , as soon as they are able to swal@@ lowed the capsules with taking the solution for the intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r / kg of body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no Dos@@ age recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ts and low do@@ si@@ zed k@@ on@@ avi@@ r may be avoided , this combination of these patients can be avoided .
although a dose adap@@ tion for Am@@ sh@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ts in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
based on the potential risk of a toxic response as a result of the high Prop@@ ylene solution in response to inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a compens@@ ate inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism , and possibly serious and / or life @-@ threatening effects as heart rhythms ( z ) .
the patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy is not to be one of the cure of HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ism or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic , do not prevent the risk 47 of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs , the serious or life @-@ threatening effects may cause such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of International norm@@ alization ratio ) , methods are provided for determination of drug concentration .

100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were at least 3 months after the start of treatment with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby the patients were compared to an Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days for patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to an early release from the study ) were det@@ ectable by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ iers ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies before , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ low @-@ antibody levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while patients with high antibodies to G@@ AG was found at Har@@ n in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ale until low @-@ neutral effect on the enzym@@ atic Lar@@ oni@@ zation activity in vitro , which seemed to be the clinical efficacy and / or reduction by G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse authority in connection with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies in relation to the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the accus@@ ation for the enzymes is in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ str@@ ated sub@@ str@@ ates and the accumulation of an additional accumulation of enzymes in the enzymes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is absorbed rapidly from the circulation system and of cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most prob@@ able by Mann@@ ers @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate - receptors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited to recru@@ its the whole of disease &apos;s disease , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient had the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had a perfectly exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage of percentage of FE@@ V and the absolute case in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me received .
after 26 weeks of therapy , treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement in lung function and the ability to make the ability in the following table .
in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and a 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows the table below .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly reduced over these period , and the absolute lung volume increased more and propor@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tioned in the height of growing children .
treatment of 26 patients with a hep@@ at@@ om@@ eg@@ aly achieved 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
the first 4 weeks showed a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the academic year .
regarding a combined disease wor@@ sen@@ ation between the patients who received a combined percentage of FE@@ V , track in a 6 @-@ minute intervals ( at 58 % ) , improved in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
one year &apos;s open phase 2 study was conducted primarily by the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients who were at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with heavy lock form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients , dos@@ ing dosage was increased to 200 E / kg over the last 26 weeks in the Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several Pati@@ ents ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase in weight ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean age form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , while in the older patients with severe failure of only limited or even no progress made in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ ologically effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me fe@@ eder schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test were performed .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing ema with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fusion , however , is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent .

A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated in patients who have not yet treated with c@@ is@@ platin and in patients who previously received other anth@@ ra@@ cycline treated as mono@@ therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B12 ) and vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ platin , a &quot; anti@@ freeze &quot; ( medicine against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given .
in patients whose blood can be changed or when certain other side effects occur when the treatment should be reduced , removed or the dose can be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed di@@ pped the formation of the DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells to divide the cells .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed into its active form is lighter than in healthy cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication through and a longer period of cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ ans , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 456 patients who received no chemotherapy prior to their disease .
for the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with the effects of doc@@ etaxel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , while both in combination with c@@ is@@ platin offers a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ platin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months when compared with 9.@@ 3 months .
patients who had already received chemotherapy had already received the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ etaxel .
in both studies , however , patients showed cancer cell carcinoma in which the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta remained longer survival compared with the comparative medicine .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. made a approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be used with 4,2 ml sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , which allows a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - SIS is taken from the flow bottle and with a 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) of 100 ml of di@@ lution ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ platin indicated for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcinoma , except for over@@ l@@ ating disk hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ platin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours for 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F has given the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment .
the reduction of incidence and sever@@ ity of Hau@@ tre@@ m@@ atisation must be given on the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the whole P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to obtain intra@@ mus@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in one week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed dose as well as every third time @-@ saving cycle .

at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , dos@@ ing examination was held , taking place by the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the prior treatment cycles .
following the recovery , the patients have to be treated in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a single agent or in combination with c@@ is@@ platin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ oxi@@ ity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient in front of the treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken down if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ re@@ lics or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity 3 or 4 presence or so@@ - fort in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 ne@@ ot@@ oxi@@ di@@ ets .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ hundert , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increase of efficiency compared to patients at the age of 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to adequate data regarding the un@@ thinking and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need c@@ is@@ ations necessary for all patients recommended Dos@@ age .
data in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not enough ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with an liver function of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values from &gt; to 3.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.2 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies .
patients have to be treated with regard to the bone transplan@@ ts and P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed can not be given to patients before the absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the throm@@ bo@@ sis - again reaching a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutr@@ alization , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ l , and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology toxicity as they have observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ oxid@@ ants , for neutr@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was taken up if a treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 .
therefore , all patients who are treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lak@@ tical measure on the basis of reducing toxicity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to be repeated for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ ate , 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are planned for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , taking the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events emerged , the risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , vor@@ ing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid - collection in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer is wo@@ unding in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed treatment .
5 gravity events , including M@@ yo@@ kar@@ d@@ inf@@ ra , and sm@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed occasionally when this substance is given to be given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the con@@ current use of atten@@ ui@@ ties ( except yellow fever , these vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indications ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a ir@@ reversible shafts re@@ productive the re@@ productive @-@ capacity of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , men should be noted in front of the treatment - it should be noted , consultation regarding the sper@@ ma@@ ker@@ age .
in patients with normal cardi@@ oid function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a reduction of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed separation with the result of a multip@@ ly resolutions of side effects .
therefore , it is required to be used when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) will be applied in high dose of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage .

as no data regarding the potential of potential potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time period such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application has to be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the nucle@@ us status during the disease and the ability of interaction between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires an increased frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient suffering from oral anti@@ coag@@ ulation .
there are no data on the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed near Schw@@ ang@@ eren , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ etab@@ oli@@ an application are expected to be found in an application in the pregnancy of birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except for essential and after careful dis@@ closure of the utility for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of a irre@@ versi@@ bly from the re@@ productive @-@ capacity of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed , men should be noted before the start of the treatment , advice on the sper@@ ma@@ kon@@ service .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients carried out in the treatment arm the test media .
statistically significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ platin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ est Cis@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment resulted in an improvement of lung working parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ platin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in the lung function during the time .
a multi@@ centre , randomised , open phase III study of AL@@ IM@@ TA with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after receiving chemotherapy came with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in combination with doc@@ etaxel patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

it is used for over@@ sized adults with a body massage index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meters in combination with low cal@@ ory consumption , fet@@ ched diet .
patients who take care of All@@ i and after 12 weeks , do not use weight loss , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
these enzymes become em@@ bell@@ ished , they can not build some fats in the food , making it around a quarter of the food which passes it in the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a placebo between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg .
in the study with all patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , it could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common adverse events of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are edi@@ ble spots on the after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) , of chair , fet@@ al / ö@@ liger chair , se@@ amed sections ( strings ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs .

All@@ i is for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ( 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fet@@ ched diet .
All@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there is no sufficient data on the efficacy and safety .
since or@@ li@@ stat , however , if or@@ li@@ stat will only be minimal res@@ or@@ ised in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .

since the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved metabolic control , patients should take a drug against diabetes , before beginning of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti @-@ diabetic must be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines against high blood pressure or increased blood cholesterol , should be adjusted to their doctor or pharmac@@ ok@@ er , whether the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet extra fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent the oral contra@@ cep@@ tions in the case of severe di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö possible ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study and interaction of medicines as well as in several cases with the benefit of or@@ li@@ stat and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed .
during the application of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick values ( international norm@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4 ) .
most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ li@@ stat , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins in the norm range .
however , the patients should be recommended to take a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin @-@ proof , to ensure sufficient daily intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the addition of a single dose of Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ li@@ stat , a minor decrease in Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
or@@ li@@ stat side @-@ effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly prevented with the pharmac@@ ological effect of medicine using the pharmac@@ ological effect of pharmaceuticals , as the absorption of a bias of fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal effects of clinical trials were identified with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easily and temporarily .
the skins are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency on the basis of the available data ) .
the frequency of the known side effects that were determined after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , it is not known since these events were voluntarily sur@@ rendered from a population un@@ certain size .
† It is ch@@ ann@@ bel that lead the treatment with all@@ i to le@@ mm@@ ings with respect to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight patients without a significant clinical results .
in multiple cases the cases of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dose were either any side @-@ side effects or similar effects like at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on studies , humans and animal can be carried out by a quick re@@ formation of systemic effects that are attributed to the li@@ pas@@ ous properties of or@@ li@@ stat , which are prec@@ eded by or@@ li@@ stat .
the therapeutic effect is set in the lum@@ ens of the Mag@@ ens and the upper bo@@ wel to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ des and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical trials was derived that 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , three times daily , the absorption of about 25 % of the food was blocked .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo controlled studies on adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 set up the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fet@@ ched nutrition .
the primary parameters , the change in body weight compared with the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ alization ) , as follows : as a change of those participants in the study ( table 1 ) and as share of those participants who have lost more than 5 % and more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies , weight loss was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol amounted to or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

Alo@@ xi is applied to chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ platin ) , as well as chemo@@ therapies for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the extra gift of an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ lock ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended to lie since the effects in this age group are not enough .
this means that the substance in the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the receptors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was investigated in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , which received chemotherapy regim@@ en , which are strong and moderate for nausea and vomiting .
in chemo@@ therapies , 59 % of patients who received chemotherapy for nausea and vomiting which were treated with Alo@@ xi @-@ treated patients ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chemo@@ therapies , which are treated for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi @-@ treated patients ( 153 from 189 ) to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki @-@ Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . an approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is Indian : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily em@@ itted chemotherapy , due to a cancer condition and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy regim@@ en .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induc@@ ted by a strong chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ onic mp@@ ass@@ age , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al Ob@@ sessions or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us to be monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antag@@ onists , however , it is possible to extend the addition of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication that Q@@ T interval are extended or in patients where Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or to one such an extension .
in connection with another chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used to prevent the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron inhi@@ bit the chemotherapy regim@@ en ( Cis@@ platin , cyclo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide , Cy@@ clo@@ abine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin and Mit@@ om@@ ycin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ ties between one @-@ one intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady edi@@ al met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitor .
based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ a ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibitors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ a , dy@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , lac@@ on@@ avi@@ r , spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not expected , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used with pregnant women , unless there is necessary to be used by the treat doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of patients had a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and homeless ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ market experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins of adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ drug relations .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies based on the large volume volume , however , is probably not an effective treatment for alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies have received a total of 1.@@ 132 mg / m2 of do@@ is@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ icin ( half hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half hours of 7.@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ous to one day .
in a randomized double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosp@@ ha@@ mide , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams p@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received treatment with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ bodied chemotherapy are consolidated in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c intervals with the appropriate effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the studies of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels at the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the ion channels .
the target of 221 healthy subjects were the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. i.@@ o. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single outlets from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous treatment follows an initi@@ ation decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination of the body with an average pay@@ out time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentrate @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) is generally in general in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 - 90 g / kg for therapy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous treatment of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the daily intraven@@ ous treatment of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable at 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max had a value of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated and roughly 50 % will be converted into two primary metast@@ ases , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , less than 1 % of the effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the metabolism that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of the dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a single intraven@@ ous investment program , the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver function for the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ ies and the average systemic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is therefore non@@ zero .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects have been observed , only to ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient to be considered to be sufficient for clinical use of clinical exposure .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical trials showed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels , which can be involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation process .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose was recorded in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure of people ) , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ es ( in thy@@ roid , hyp@@ ophy@@ se , P@@ ank@@ re@@ as , ou@@ ni@@ er@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ eric in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and Alo@@ xi &apos;s people used to be a unique application , the relevance of these results will be higher than for human beings .
the owner of this approval for the transport must bring the European Commission to grant its plans for the application of the application in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) approved the approval of the approval of the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C , using Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml of injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon has a biological medicine called Ro@@ feron @-@ A with the same freedom @-@ effective element , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; reference &quot; &quot; reference &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long continuing ) hepatitis C ( eine through a Vir@@ usin@@ f@@ ection of liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzymes Al@@ an@@ en Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon put data on data compared to the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ feron @-@ A ( drug structure , composition , and purity of pharmaceuticals , effect of effectiveness , safety and efficacy at hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alph@@ eon has been compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference drug .
the study was measured in the study , as many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in blood ) .

in addition , we have been aware that the data to the stability of the drug and marketing medication is not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , who responded to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ feron @-@ A , was in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon Fire Ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease in more patients again than with the reference model ; they had Alph@@ eon more side effects .
apart from that , in the study , the test was introduced in the study , in@@ wi@@ ev@@ ement , the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body is antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ formation of skin cells ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( an@@ iss@@ or cutting ) , off @-@ di@@ ligence and se@@ wn bets .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably due to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ separ@@ ati@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because of Alar@@ go is not possible against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients with 18 years , the amount of skin is no longer than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient was not allowed to treatment for two to three days , the doctor should once again examine and alternative treatments should be once again .
it acts as a block of bacterial infections ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
principal Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was taken after the end of treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were randomized to placebo .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ins , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in are similar response rates : if the results of both studies were observed in front of their studies , about 90 % of the patients were both in the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was diagnosed in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( sub@@ filled hollow areas in the body fabric ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective .
the most common side effects with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients was observed ) .
the European Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on short @-@ surface treatment in the following super@@ fici@@ ency amounts are : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • positive small Laz@@ er@@ ation , checks , or se@@ wn bets .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . , a approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go on the entire European Union .
the patients who shows no change within two to three days , should be examined once again and an alternative therapy can be drawn into consideration ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensitivity or severe local Ir@@ rit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage Sal@@ be , the treatment of salt was carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment in the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections , in which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials , in clinical trials , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was induced in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ ine @-@ resistant stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative treatment should be drawn into consideration , if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment does not have no change or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the impact of the simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plas@@ ma@@ concentrations that have been reached in human application on a mol@@ ded skin or un@@ infected surface , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo are not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .

due to the low systematic exposure of patients , dos@@ ing is not required for necessary , if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive @-@ drugs according to oral intake and are inadequate response to the birth and the fö@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al Development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was the offering of an systemic antibiotic treatment .
with the decision to end whether the breast@@ plate was continued / end or completed with Al@@ tar@@ go &apos;s / end , it should be completed between the benefit of the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go reported the most commonly reported cor@@ rit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of patients were concerned .

the effect of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacter@@ ium ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the bin@@ o@@ gene@@ ous substances of other ri@@ bos@@ ses .
data point out that the bin@@ ation site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 was involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ der and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase centre .

because am@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical ingredients , some of the data which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as a reward for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of g@@ mi@@ ger@@ m children , which had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection .
in an additional trial with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ination was compared with a six month and a 12 month distance between the two injections was compared .
in ambient temperatures between 98 % and 100 % of g@@ ger@@ m @-@ age children aged between 98 and 100 % of the total injection in the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection was similar to ambient temperature in a 6 @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ectors was similar .
the most common adverse events of ambient rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache deficiency , loss of injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a approval for the transport of ambi@@ rix in the entire region
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with ambient temperature rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collecting vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis B as well as hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or vacc@@ inated with a combination @-@ defect .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B virus antigen ( anti @-@ hepatitis C ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are antibodies in the same magnit@@ ude with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully backed by the immune system of immun@@ ity individuals who need to be vacc@@ inated on a hepatitis C virus , because they are not det@@ ectable by the immun@@ ological memory for no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 How to all injection products should be for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the addition of the vaccine for the medical treatment and monitoring is always available .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dised disease is recommended that the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant B @-@ B surface antigen .
in hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with faul@@ ts of immune system , however , the basic anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies will be achieved in this cases the offering of other vaccine doses can be required .

at throm@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders can be inj@@ ected in order to be inj@@ ected , as it can be inj@@ ected in these cases according to intra@@ mus@@ cular treatment .
in the second of a separate injection system in the form of a separate injection system ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or a combined mas@@ cul@@ - Mum@@ ps vacc@@ ines , was given to the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immune diseases or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it may not be sufficient immune response .
in a clinical trial dealing with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ness , gastro@@ ent@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable with the incidence which was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ age and preserv@@ atives @-@ containing vacc@@ ination .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , toler@@ ability of ambi@@ ence was compared with the 3 @-@ doses drop in combination .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and vali@@ dity on a comp@@ utation basis per vaccine dose of rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the addition of ambient temperatures of 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects were observed compared to 3@@ 9.1 % during the treatment of a 3 @-@ doses drop .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the test subjects were given , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % for the subjects who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the frequency of Mat@@ ness was similar to the same ( i.e. the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received ambient temperatures , compared to 3@@ 6,@@ 2 % for the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses drop .
the incidence of pre@@ lu@@ ous pain and mat@@ ness was low and comparable to the dos@@ ing of the combination image processing is observed with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ines .
in a comparison study on 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ lingen , the occurrence of local re@@ organisation and general public reactions were comparable with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 mc@@ g of combin@@ ant B @-@ B surface antigen .
however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , it was reported to vacc@@ ination with ambient temperature ( at the injection ) per dosage , not per pro@@ tape , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations containing severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ inated with ambient temperatures of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A and 10 µ@@ g combin@@ ant units containing hepatitis B virus , was statistically significant .
in clinical trials , ranging from 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99,@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second one month ( i.e. , per month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and a 100 % one month after the second one month ( i.e. , per month 7 ) .

in the 28@@ 9 persons , the immuno@@ ogen@@ esis evalu@@ able was the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 in the case of 3 @-@ dose @-@ cell material significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix .
the immune system , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after dis@@ termin@@ ation of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 doses of vacc@@ inated vacc@@ ines with a combination of 360 ELISA and a combination @-@ containing hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of combin@@ ant B @-@ B surface antigen .
in people who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ ering between 12 and 15 years old , the percussion of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immuno@@ therapy with ambient temperatures of 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ines .
the immune response was comparable to both anti@@ gens which was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses using a combination @-@ containing hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant B @-@ B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .

the hepatitis C virus is usually transferred by viral food and beverage , but can also be transferred through other paths , such as swimming in the waters of the waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ astic face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms which may make a stationary treatment .
like all vacc@@ ines , ambi@@ rix is not completely protect against infection with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccine doses have already been infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus ( although you don &apos;t have to feel the vaccine time not yet or sick / feel ) a disease may not prevent the disease .
a protection against other infections caused by the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those who are similar to the hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection .
in your child , if you have an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may even have an allergic reaction to cancer . • If you occurred / your child even an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against Hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you have a severe infection with a fever .
• If you wish to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months , and before the general administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ines , the doctor will give you / your child by a vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ ence .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ectors from a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of the hepatitis B virus ( 360 ELISA units of an formal hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combin@@ ant B @-@ B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vacc@@ ination with reduced salary is usually one month after the first dose , and should give you a vacc@@ ines before the battle of the vacc@@ ines .
sometimes , ambi@@ rix in people who suffer from severe blood cells . • If you have weak@@ ened / your child because of a illness or treatment in your / its own body is weak@@ ened , or if you have to under@@ go with a hem@@ aly@@ sis / child failure .
ambi@@ rix in cases can be given in these cases , but the immune response rate of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strong the response to the vacc@@ ination is vacc@@ inated .
21 S@@ agen You will take your doctor if you have more drug / your child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without the disappearance ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated ( antibodies ) or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or have been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , and the person is not being protected against one or both hepatitis B and B viruses .
if another vaccine will be given at the same time with ambient ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and as possible as different form@@ ulations .
if ambient rix at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immersion in case , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually am@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered , except it is ur@@ gently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis B as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ ycin ( antibiotic ) once more / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ines , you &apos;re talking to your doctor and enter a new date as soon as possible .

based on the data , which has become known for the implementation of the first approval , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefit of the benefit ratio remains positive to ambient temperatures .
since ambi@@ rix , however , only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited to this drug .
ammon@@ ia can also be used to treat patients with in@@ complete en@@ cephal@@ op@@ ric or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ical en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain compensation for high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the history of the history .
Amm@@ on@@ ola is divided into meals , split by the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ sto@@ mi@@ esch@@ l@@ ders ( into the stomach @-@ hose ) or a Nas@@ al son@@ de ( by the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia did not treat patients with another treatment or placebo ( a medicine designed , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also increase appetite , loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , pe@@ eling , liquid repell@@ ent , fla@@ vor@@ ings or flavour @-@ version , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , adher@@ ence , rash , un@@ pleasant body fat or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Amm@@ on@@ aps were effective in patients with dis@@ ruption in a ure@@ a cycle of ammon@@ ia to high ammon@@ ia .
Amm@@ on@@ ola was approved by &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; since due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information on this medication .
the use of all patients indi@@ ct in which a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ers should be manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 living ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ kins form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which consists of the first life months ) , an indication of the use when An@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for babies who are not able to swal@@ lowed tablets as well as for those who are not able to swal@@ lowed tablets or in gran@@ ular form , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulation form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the development of the necessary daily protein intake of the patients .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg , as well as extra @-@ growing and adults .
patients who suffer from a fixed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day , or 3.8 g / m ² / day are required .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ ul@@ um deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day , or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with can@@ opy , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ re@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a if the tablets does not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ y@@ rat that corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ genital heart failure or serious renal failure , and with sodium re@@ tention and oil formation only with caution .
because met@@ er@@ isation and the separation of sodium poly@@ phen@@ y@@ rat over the liver and the kidney , the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ ction ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatment of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal loss and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed friction coefficient of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is di@@ vor@@ ced in the breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ ction during the post@@ period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events , it was assumed that they did not use with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in connection with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neurop@@ athy , and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis .
one case of over@@ do@@ zing stood at a 5 @-@ month @-@ old small child with a acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ons during a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic rate that con@@ fer@@ mented by acet@@ yl with glut@@ amine to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ stment , which will be the ki@@ cking off the ki@@ cks .
stur@@ b@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen .
patients with dis@@ ruption in a ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that each gram of bias sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mm@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of significance that the diagnosis was increased early and treatment to improve the treatment of survival and improve the clinical results .
the prog@@ nosis of the earliest symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease himself led to death with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free analo@@ ga to death .
through hem@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life months ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was diagnosed at 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to spiritual disabilities or other neurological disorders .
in patients with a late mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ gene@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase chain ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical deficit are also in the treatment of hardly re@@ versi@@ bly and in some patients can occur further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ neurological .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is used in liver and kidney enzyme , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metast@@ asis in plasma and urine were measured for an individual dose of 5 grams of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl i@@ ons with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabolism was also examined with cancer patients after intraven@@ ous treatment of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets were determined 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycli@@ c cycl@@ ines or h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis that were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single boxes ) , the middle @-@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations appear in the plasma concentration on the third day five times higher than after the first forks .
separation The medicine is available within 24 hours about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the ki@@ d@@ ment .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ i &apos;s tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no toxic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at will either be taken either oral ( babies and children who cannot swal@@ lowed any tablets , or patients with can@@ opy ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ sto@@ mi@@ esch@@ l@@ z or a Nas@@ hi@@ son@@ de .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day with a total weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a weight of over 20 kg , as well as extra @-@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range .
patients who suffer from a fixed lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day , or 3.8 g / m ² / day are required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ y@@ rat that corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ dees were exposed in the Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ aboli@@ t of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyrami@@ ds of Hirn@@ rin@@ d .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neurop@@ athy , and P@@ ank@@ re@@ atitis .
stur@@ b@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suited as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess
based on investigations carried out over the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ruption of a ure@@ a cycle . it can be produced for each gram of bias sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mm@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical deficit are also in the treatment of hardly re@@ versi@@ bly , and in some patients can occur further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ neurological .
after a oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ ur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can fit the pre @-@ finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring sco@@ op 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved before use in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g of water ) .
in patients with these rare disease , certain liver enzymes are missing certain liver enzymes that they can not withdraw from proteins in the body &apos;s consumption , even after consumption of proteins in the body .

angi@@ ox is used to use blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI @-@ factor , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after surgery .
this can contribute with Ang@@ ina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to the heart and to increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the primary study on the treatment of ACS and patients with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ Inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicines for hin@@ ge of blood cl@@ ots ) with a common combination treatment system ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
while the PCI was frequently used to treat patients ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies , in order to prevent a failure to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ ximab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without the addition of G@@ PI - the aim of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who were subjected to a PCI , angi@@ ox was effective in relation to all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except heavy bleeding , in which it was clearly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may vary according to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other her@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components .
it should not be applied in patients who had a bleeding , as well as in people with strong blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox was in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI @-@ removable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ etechnik f@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in a emergency handle or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ages of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the treatment is carried out in a single episode , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the treatment is 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose is 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure should be administered at 0,5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the input .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a pre@@ valence of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a Hier@@ on@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h is at least for the duration of the surgery .
safety and efficacy of a multiple Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if the value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) are short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ er@@ tification of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the emergence of low @-@ level values , the re@@ active and dil@@ uted drugs before the application is carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose is administered quickly .
as soon as the ACT value more than 225 seconds , an additional monitoring is not required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is needed .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine or ACS ) should be used for a lower rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg , and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ t dose .
in patients with moderate renal damage , which led to the approval of the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT reached 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adap@@ ation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients with angi@@ ox contra@@ indications ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can take 30 minutes after dis@@ termin@@ ation of intraven@@ ous treatment of un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after dis@@ closure of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift from low molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the drug or a rest of hem@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or improved blood risk distur@@ ban@@ ces . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardiovascular disease . • severe kidney compensation ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood flow , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ans ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din can occur most blood pressure on arter@@ ial point levels , in patients undergoing per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ated intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of suffering anywhere blood .
patients who are using War@@ far@@ in and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be drawn into consideration a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ ised ratio ) to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was again reached prior to treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din .
based on the knowledge about the effect of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an@@ cies ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ er ) , it may be assumed that these active ingredients increase the blood cells .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require a treatment with insulin delivery .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ bones or the upper arm were inj@@ ected or in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body cannot be sufficient insulin to control the glucose levels ( sugar ) in blood , or insulin is not effective .
insulin @-@ insulin differs very small from Human@@ itarian , and the change means that it appears faster and a shorter time has a short @-@ time human rights .
A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin delivery in patients with type 1 Diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin delivery in two studies with a total of 5@@ 72 children and in one study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
for type 2 diabetes , in which the body is insulin @-@ effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in one study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the principal Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the change in concentration of the substance gly@@ ceri@@ de ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) showed a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin injection per year .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration of 0.@@ 46 % after six months ended with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,@@ 30 % of human norm@@ alization .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied in patients who may be sensitive to ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other drugs , which may impact on the blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH , a approval of the marketing authori@@ zation of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in the area of the stomach @-@ ceiling , to turn or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal belt .
due to the reduced glucose levels and the reduced insulin delivery , insulin delivery can be lowered to patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the strength , the brand ( production ) , insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc die @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can pull a change of insulin needs .
3 A insufficient dose or treatment of treatment , in particular in patients with a insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia and an diabetic check@@ box ; these conditions are potentially threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin @-@ type or insulin delivery of another manufacturer should be carried out under str@@ close medical control and may make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ mia , depends on the drug profile of the used insulin delivery and may change the schem@@ atic of the treatment of treatment .
