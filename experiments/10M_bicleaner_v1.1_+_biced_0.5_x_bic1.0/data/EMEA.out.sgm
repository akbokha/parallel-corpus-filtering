<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European opening report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) is judged by the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) to report recommendations to the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your disease or their treatment, please read the pack-line (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you wish more information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting, as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. discres thinking and speaking of things that are not available), missions and motions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological illness in which the patient (periods of periods of periods) alternately alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe malentepisodes and prevention of manoeuvee, in the past, in the past, applied in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to fast control of increased lack or behaviours, if the oral medication is not possible by means of medication.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to inserting or the melting tray in patients, which are preparing the canes of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines, as well as Abify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affect the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances, which enable communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol works probably mainly as "partitions" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-Hydroxytryptamine (also Serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means, Aripiprazol as 5-Hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and bipolar disorder with schizophrenia and biological disorder makes a role played by Aripiprazol, to normalize the activity of the brain, making psychotic or manische symptoms are reduced, and their recovery will be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, which occur to prevent symptoms, was investigated in three studies on up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was administered in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to an increased accident, over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abify and placebo over twelve weeks in a further study was assigned to the efficacy of Abify and placebo. in another study, 160 patients were stabilised at 160 patients in which the Ottoman symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injector has been observed in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disturbance, which compared to the increased accident, with the Lorazepam (another antipsychosis) and placebo over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients received on a standard scale of bipolar disturbance or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body is the melting tray and the solution for inserts (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution, the Abilify doses were measured in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms increased as the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disturbance Abilify in four of the five short-term studies were more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">For up to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented more effective than placebo for the recovery of Manisoepisodes in previously treated patients and if it was also administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections was reduced in 10- or 15-mg doses in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo infeed and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (unload), headache (strain relief), headache (strain relief), pig's disease (increased storage), objection and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion, Ruhelomissibility, Insoming (sleep disturbances) and anxiety disorders.</seg>
<seg id="25">The European Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium-medium to severe adverse events in patients who had mostly manoeuvested against the killing of Aripiprazol, against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution for patients with schizophrenia or patients with metastatic disease worms in bipolar-I error, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., a approval of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of a new Germanic episodes of the Bipolar-I- disorder and the prevention of a new Germanic episode of patients who had predominantly manische episodes and their manorial episodes were shown on treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages on a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, irrespective of meals as a single agent or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">In view of the bigger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be drawn into consideration, if clinical factors do this right (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductors from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The emergence of successive disorders belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases following an antipsychotherapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disturbance, there was no increased viewpoint risk with Aripiprazol in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol was diagnosed with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (mutanemia, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducers) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were no reports about the treatment of Aripiprazol in Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">When using an ABILIFY treated patients, symptoms and symptoms of a late dyskinesia, should be drawn into consideration that the dose to reduce or reduced treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs and symptoms are designed to indicate a mns, or even clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be deemed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol was supposed to be used in people with crawmen in anamnesis or in case that are associated with crawmen in relation to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychic who were associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fiddle dosage, a significant correlation between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely well and associated with ketacacia and hyperosmolarem compression or death, was treated with atypical antipsychotic ingredients, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events at ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic ingredients treated patients who allow direct delay.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polygon, polyphagie and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus and risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in regards to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain will be generally used in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar varieties that use antipsychotics, which is known as a tributary of antipsychotics, or of a healthy life-effects, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system is required, if Aripiprazol is required in combination with alcohol or other centralised medication that is taken by side effects like Sealing (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, whereby this effect is not relevant as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It's to expect that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paradoxetine, similar effects have to be made from similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "E") may be the joint application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol resulting in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you use the common administration of Ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors using ABILIFY, potentially should not exceed potential risk of potential risks in the patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-protease inhibitor, have similar effects and that should be similar to similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4-Inhibitors the dose of ABILIFY should be raised at a dose of dose-level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY, can be ordered with an increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical trials showed no significant effect on the metabolism of CYP2D6 (Dextromethyl an / 3-method morphine ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethyl).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should be taken to dissolve their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy, for treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data on the security and due to the inadequate response to the animal, this medication should not be applied in the pregnancy, because the potential benefit does not make the potential risk of potential for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned about that, non-dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are sure, Aripiprazol has no negative impact on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) than under Placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the downside effects are defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled-term study with 52 weeks of patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total of less incidence (25.8%) were treated with bladder, Dystonie and dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with semi-operated dol (57.3%).</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medical differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Impact of CPK (Kreatin-Phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomotor were observed in 3.5% of patients with Aripiprazol treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">In relation to the side effects that can occur in connection with Aripiprazol in connection with Aripiprazol, defensive cerebrovascular events and increased mortality by older Demency patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentions or intentions were observed with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">If there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemoalysis in treatment with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemoalysis in treatment of a overdose is, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma proteins.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is alleged that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and Bipolar-I error occurs on the combination of a participator effect on dopamine D2- and Serotonin 5HT1r receptors and a real effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D4 and 5HT2a receptor as well as an adequate affinity for dopamine D4, to Serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenders and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">For the treatment of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily, the Positters Emissions-Tomography showed a dosage dependent reduction in the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Frius caudatus and the coup.</seg>

<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, for Aripiprazol was a significantly higher reduction in the rate of cancer at 34% in Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olans controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, 314 patients suffering from Aripiprazol (N = 18 or 13% of evaluable patient response) showed a minimum of 7% increase compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, more flexible dosages of 3 weeks with a branch or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed an increase of placebo in reducing the reduction in reducing care symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study, over 3 weeks with fiddle dosage, with a branch or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed significant effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy studies, more than 12 weeks in patients with a branch or mixed episode of a bipolar-I error, Aripiprazol showed a positive effect on placebo in week 3 and an adverse effect that was comparable to lithium or Half dol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol, showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission in Manie like lithium or Half dol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of a bipolar-I error, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing care symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a remission phase, followed by a remission phase for more than 74 weeks, Aripiprazol was superior to placebo in response to prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly with prevention of a return in Manie.</seg>

<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver cirrhosis of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to pull off the end of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity of Toxicity, genotoxiity and for the canelized potential, the pre-clinical data was no special dangers for people.</seg>

<seg id="300">Ruhelosibility 1 The incidence of hypersensitivity is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 789 patients.</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and it was not established not a kausal relationship with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a non-microtubuli-substance which promotes the formation of microtubules from the tubes and the microtubules due to inhibition of deolymer stabilization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is essential for the vitale Interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is well known that Albumsis of plasma components are mediated in the endothelial cells as well as in-vitro studies that the presence of Albumin in the transport of paclitaxel was operated by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transiting transport through the GP-60-Albuminrezeptor is conveyed and due to the Albanian protein SPARC (Bted protein acidic rich in cysteine) in a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the Tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is treated with data from 106 patients in two single-infected studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparison study.</seg>

<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time by progression-free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-Line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxiity from paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived a peripheral neuropathy degree at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for use on Baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated, and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel to 30- and 180-minute Infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was identified in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug process (AUC) increased linear of 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous treatment of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, paclitaxel and plasma concentration participated in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average sales volume of 632 l / m2; the high capacity volume has a far-reaching extract distribution and / or turntables of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel to intravenous 30-minutes Infusion was compared to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2, in combination with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">In addition, the clearing of paclitaxel was higher (43%), when compared to a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">Published in the published literature on in vitro-vitro studies of human liver and tissues, paclitaxel is alleged that paclitaxel is the first line of 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metastases (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value of 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 3" -p hydroxyypaclitaxel was increased.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed a biological medicine is similar to the European Union (EU) and the same substance (also called "reference").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood coagulation which could occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications could not be possible in case of a blood transfusion, where an blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed has to be launched under supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to let a bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or inscriminicerson, in order to get a reasonable guide.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or patients who received chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values are always observed in the recommended field (between 10 and 12 grams per day in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dL with children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to check in the treatment, to ensure that no iron deficiency should be administered and iron ore should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anemia can be caused by a erythropoietindeficiency or so that the body is not sufficiently on the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery in order to increase the number of red blood cells and thus increasing the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell, into a gene (DNA) into a gene (DNA), allowing them to education on the formation of epoetin.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was administered at administration of a Vene in a study of 479 patients, which compared to a kidney problems caused by kidney problems, with the reference medium.</seg>
<seg id="370">All this study participating in this study was at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vene before they were used either on Abseamed or continued to have Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Principal Indicator for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobin between the beginning of the study and the probation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study that received the effects of Eprex / Erypo with one of Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin patients were caused by kidney problems, in the same size, as for those who received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who received Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dL output of 12,0 g / dL.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effects of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally can lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stecholocation, headache, and water.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may vary sensitive (allergenic) against epoetin alfa or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed than injection of the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as more studies are needed to ensure that as an allergic reactions shall be triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The European Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for Abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union, the medicine has been a comparative quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which provides Abseamed, is preparing for medical experts in all Member States information, including information on the safety of the medication.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG, approval of the marketing authorization of Abseamed into the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anemia and reduction of transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem Myelom, who received chemotherapy for chemotherapy (for example the cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be carried out only in patients with moderate anemia (hemorglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available (4 or more units for blood in women; 5 or more units for blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blot, Abseamed can be used before a large electroorthotics in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion compensation is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">Hb 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be applied, which can not participate in an autologous blood donors.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin-target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dL (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for paperical patients where the hemoglobin concentration was between 9.5 and 11 g / dL (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anesmiesymptomas and follications can be different from age, sex and total disease of disease; therefore, the assessment of an individual clinical response and illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise of hemoglobes by more than 2 g / dL (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, occasionally at a patient with individual hemoglobin values above or under the hememoglobin target.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of these hemoglobular variability, it should be tried to reach a corresponding dose of dose management, hemoglobin-target concentration of 10 g / dL (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dL (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value is greater than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent Hemoglobin value is 12 g / dL (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored to ensure that Epoetin alfa is the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia and anemia, is applied.</seg>
<seg id="392">The current results indicate that patients with initially very low halb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may be higher frequencies than those who initial anemia is less hard (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present results indicate that patients with initially very low halb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may be higher frequencies than those who initial anemia is less hard (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dose 50% / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose rate of 25 i.e. / kg (three times a week), until the desired objective is reached (this should be achieved in steps from at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anesmiesymptome and - follow-up of these patients depending on age, sex and total disease of disease; therefore, the assessment of an individual clinical response and illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of these hemoglobular variability, it should be tried to reach a corresponding dose of dose management, hemoglobin-target concentration of 10 g / dL (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dL (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">The patients should be monitored to ensure that Epoetin alfa is the lowest approved dose which is required for control of anesthetic symptoms, is applied.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of hemoglobin order for at least 1 g / dL (0,62 mmol / l) or the rate of recurrent value, the dose of 150% / kg times a week or 450 lbs / kg per week / kg each week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin-rise &lt; 1 g / dL (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the tikulozytenant value (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 o / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If following a further 4 weeks of therapy with 300 V / kg three times a week of hemoglobin order to grow at ≥ 0,62 mmol / l (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the recurrent value of more than 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 mg / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is &lt; 1 g / dL (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l), respectively, compared to the initial value, is an appeal to the epoetin-alfa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the prevalence of ≥ 4 blood contamination is required, should be used twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donors program, so far from the start of the seamed treatment of large iron reserves are available.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 pounds / kg of Epoetin alfa once a week of three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of the surgery (day 0) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="405">Here's Epoetin alfa's preoperatively 300 l / kg every day before the day before surgery, as well as 4 days directly after it was immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis hose by a Fistelnadel, followed by 10 ml isotonic cookery solution to rinse the hose and a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who received treatment with any erythropoietin on an erythroroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA), should no defect or another erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastoma).</seg>

<seg id="411">In patients with sudden load loss, defined as a reduction of hemoglobin (1 - 2 g / dL per month), if the usual causes of infusion (iron, foldable or vitamin B12 deficiency, alkaloid toxikation, infections and inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the exchange rate is normal, if the anemia is normal (i.e. the risk of recurrence or leukocyte), the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data for immunotherapy at subcutaneous application of Abseamed in patients with a risk of anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency was not exceeded in the maintenance therapy, under Section 4.2 recommendation of the limit of hemoglobin-target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">Clinical trials have been observed in clinical trials, while erythropoese-stimulating agents (ESA) was observed with a hamoglobination target concentration of over 12 g / dL (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit, which is attributable to the addition of epoxins, if the Hämoglobinration may be increased to the control of anesthetic symptoms and prevent blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dL (0,62 mmol / l) per month, and should not exceed 2 g / dL (1,25 mmol / l) per month, to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidence of patients with chronic renal insufficiency or storage conditions, in case of maintenance therapy, under Section 4.2 suggested the limit of hemoglobin-target concentration cannot be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">After the time of this findings, the treatment of anemia was not accelerated by the treatment of anemia in adults with kidney failure, which are not accelerated dialysis with disease insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumor patients receiving chemotherapy, patients should evaluate a 2-3 weeks delay between epoetin-alfa and the erythropotin response (patients who may be transfunerals).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dL (8.1 mmol / l), the dose may be adjusted for potential thrombosis (see section 4.2 g / dules) with the aim to keep the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dL and 12 g / dL.</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk assessment under the involvement of the respective patient who should also take part in specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are planned for a larger orthodontics, if possible, prior to the epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia was examined.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who received a larger perforated orthopaedic prophylaxis use, because they have an increased risk of thrombosis and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Moreover, it can't be excluded for treatment with Epoetin alfa for patients with a starting point value of &gt; 13 g / dL an increased risk of postoperative thrombosis / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoxine was unable to improve the increase in tumor patients with symptomatic anemia or reduced the risk of tumor growth.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy received, when a hemoglobin-target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dL (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted.</seg>
<seg id="428">Epoetin alfa will be used together with Ciclosporin, the blood mirror of Ciclosporin controlled and the ciclosporine dose of increasing hematokrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies of tumour tissue, there are no references to an interaction between Epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Of thrombosis, vascular cerebral events such as myokardinfants, arterial thrombosis, anuryssis, anurysmbants and 11 blood clots in artificial kidney was reported in patients with erythropoietin treatment, so also patients under Epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common organs during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dosage dependent increase of blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of vascular cerebral events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment with erythropoetinen.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoietin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study, there was no difference in the overall survival of patients with recombinant human erythropotin treated patients and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, treated with the combinant human erythropotin-treated patients with an anemia due to several more common Malignome-consistent, statistically significantly higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">The survival in the studies could not be identified by differences in thrombosis and related complications in with recombinant human erythropotin treated patients and controls are satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thrombovine events in tumor patients who are treated with recombinant human erythropotin, and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="443">Not to clarify how far this results are treated on the use of recombinant human erythropoietin and patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a Hämoglobination below 13 g / dL, because few patients with these characteristics were included in the tested data.</seg>

<seg id="645">One of the 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of Zoledroneic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that has been proved as dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Accordingly, the plasma jet quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum amount.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid bio-phase disappearance of the large circulation with half hours of ½ to 0,24 and t ½ h to 1 / 87 hours, followed by a long Elimination phase with an terminale Eliminationshalbswertsera t ½ h in 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early net income (α and old, with the above-mentioned ½ -values) probably represent the fast resorption of the bone and the separation over the kidney.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is also used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) can be applied. • It can also be used together with another diabetesmedicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be adjusted using metformin alone in the highest factor dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonylharnae or insulin delivery, the previous dose of Sulfonylharnae or insulin delivery can be reduced to patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); the dose of Sulfonylharnstarch (low blood sugar) should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be upgraded in better, and the blood sugar level drops, which allows type 2 diabetes better to adjust type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; the patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonylharnae, and in addition they received either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glyceyelled Hämoglobin, HbA1c) measured that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of HbA1c value, which means that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripleational study, the effect of additional treatment with metformin and a Sulfonylharnae in a reduction of HbA1c values increased by 0.94%, while the additional treatment of placebo has resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study found in which the combination of acettos and insulin had been examined in 289 patients, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to placebo in addition, compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were vision, infections of the upper respiratory tract (reduction), weight gain and hypoanthesia (low sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic cure (high definition levels - acid - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos decided in a monotherapy as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin patients (for patients) in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a approval for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved, and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin delivery in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is incompatible with insulin delivery or incompatible incompatible (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18, no data is available, therefore the application will not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are due to the presence of at least one risk factor (for example, former heart attack or symptomatic heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight-weight or eco-interest, especially those with reduced cardiovascular Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and Ödeme if Pioglitazone will be used in combination with insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a progressive macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study showed an increase of reports about heart failure, but did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzyme are as soon as possible again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed into a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, Oberbauchew, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, are the liver enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to be continued whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be resumed until the preliminary results of the clinical assessment of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dosage dependent weight increase was used to stir up fat deposits, and in some cases with a liquid form.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, under the therapy with Pioglitazone (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformalin (relative reduction of hmogloomy by 1-4%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemodynamics with 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin-sensitive therapy of patients, the Pioglitazon as oral and triple combination therapy with insulin-combination therapy, insulin delivery, the risk of a doscope of hypoglycemia.</seg>

<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it is between the taking of Pioglitazone and the emergence of macular aödems should be aware of a macular edema, if patients over disorders of visual reports; a suitable eye-examination should be drawn into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reporting from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="782">The fracisions-incidence was 1,9 Fractures per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years for women who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events which were treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fractures per 100 patient / years) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">People should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient has a pregnancy, or this one gets the treatment for the treatment (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies evaluating the interaction effects have shown that Pioglitazon no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digging, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interaction with medicines that are metabolised by these enzymes, e.g. oral contractuation, Cyclosporin, calcium chloride and HMGCoA reduktasInhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemcityrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazone to increase the 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytomic P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction of AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone in the pregnancy test hyperinsuline, increased insulin resistance to the maternity period and thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate substrates to the föal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from this data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">This lead to a temporary change in the lens and the breaks of the lens, as they can be observed in other hypoglycemic effect.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege over the three times the upper limit of the standard range is often similar to placebo but less than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylhard material.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-advanced macular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure was at 1.6% higher than in placebo if Pioglitazone can be detected below.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its launch, rarely more than heart failure was reported under Pioglitazone, but more than Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin delivery or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of messages from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and more than 7,400 patients in combination with comparative study group.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years, Fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work on activation-specific core processors (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), which leads to a increased risk of liver, fat and skeleton muscles.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as a single agent, has been investigating the time to investigate the therapeutic effected (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">After two years after the treatment of therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be seen in an increase of 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin delivery phase, was assigned to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who received only insulin had been observed with Pioglitazone group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotiations compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited to 18 weeks postoperatively.</seg>
<seg id="806">Most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in the overall plasma-triglyceride, and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol cholesterol and a small, but clinically significantly improved LDL- cholesterol cholesterol observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone fell compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide the total plasmatriglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazone, no statistically significant increase in LDL-cholesterol cholesterol observed during metformin and Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study on 20 weeks Pioglitazone has also improved the triglyceride triglyceride, but also improved the triglyceride levels, this also has an effect on the triglyceride-absorption as well as the hepatic Triglyceride Synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been assigned randomly assigned to the existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular disease following a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone has quickly absorbs, whereby the highest concentration of the Pioglitazone is usually reached after application for 2 hours.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is based on the efficacy of Pioglitazone, while the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interresponse studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digging, Warfarin, Phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">For simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemcityrom P450 2C8-inhibitor) or Rifampicin (a cytomic P450 2C8-inductor) or the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive ingredient, Pioglitazone has been found primarily in barrels (55%) and a lower scale in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Eliminitshalbon time of inchangeable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazone and its metastases are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, whereby the rates of oral Clearance is similar to the motherboards.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxikological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, after repeated administration of Plasmaiden-enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is primarily attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone in the form of hyperinsuline, increased insulin resistance from the parent, and thus reduces the availability of metabolic rate substrates to the föal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hypertension (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced by a bladder epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can result in gradients or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmune system.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage, which should be experienced by the formulation of the regime under the narrower control of one in the transplantation regime (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a row of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic antibody monitoring needs to be performed, to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains in order to ensure an alternative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The recommended dosage of Advagraf should be based on clinical assessment of absorbing and tolerability in the individual and on blood spies (see below "Recommendations</seg>

<seg id="1433">It is recommended common controls of the Tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-talview of Tacrolimus also should also be changing to Advagraf, dosing adaption, changes in immunosuressive therapy or for the same application of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing of Clearance, may require adaptations of several days until the Steady State is entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials have to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the valley levels were not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the talmirror of Tacrolimus is usually located in the whole time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5-20 ng / ml and in full blood transplanted patients at 10-20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">While the following maintenance of liver therapy, kidney and cardiac transplant were generally used in the range of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplants and other side effects that can occur in a row of Tacrolimus sub- or overseeing.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage, which should be experienced by the formulation of the regime under the narrower control of one in the transplantation regime (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">In the prophylaxis use of adult cardiac transplantation and transplantation in the Kindesold, there are no clinical data for the retardiary formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible replacement effects that can result in a reduction of the Tacrolimus level in blood, and amortisation of clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of vegetable protein (hypericum penetrating), or other plant supplements during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with Diarrhö is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in blood, as the Tacrolimus blood mirror can be subjected to such circumstances in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a group of cardiomyopathy was called chamber or Septumhypertrophib, which can also occur at Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid level and oils.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase of blood levels mainly was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal absorption.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosized prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute pathogens, increase the concentration of Tacrolimus in blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be relieved by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected by the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus lowered the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increasing the hormonal exposure, is particularly careful with decisions concerning the action of action.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal did have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduced the Clearance of pentobarbital and Phenazone and can extend their half times.</seg>

<seg id="1643">When the virus in Advantin is a "Adenovirus," which has been changed so that there is no copies of themselves, so that it can't solve any infections in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advance would have been injected directly into the tumours and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from which not defective in the human body existing p53 gene, usually contributes to restoration DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA is not restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">For Li-Fraumeni-cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company submitted data from a study involving a patient suffering from the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of subbaud, in the bones and brain.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccination that could cause a trunk to the Grippevirus which may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepanine breaks out, if a new tribe of Grippevirus is mentioned, which is easily spread of human being, because people don't have any immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccination of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the immune system of the Grippevirus parts as a "body-strands" and forms antibodies against the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form contact with an Grippevirus of this family's rapid antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane was then separated by the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which automatically detects the human body as body-free) and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A study of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not carried out according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1908">In children aged four to twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase after bodyweight is weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces HIV-quantity in blood with other antiviral medication that HIV-quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not healing, however, the cranial to the immune system, and thus regulates the development of the disease infection and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medication, but without Ritonavir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which were previously treated with Protease Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">With low dosized konavir reinforced medicines Agenerase, in 206 adults, which had taken the earlier protease inhibitor, with other protease Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Principal Indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-proven concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had no protease inhibitor had taken more patients with viral load below 400 copies / ml when compared to placebo but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Ageneric ase also reduced the viral load, however, with the children who had been treated with Protease inhibitor were only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which have been treated with Protease inhibitor were reinforced with konavir reinforced medicines Ageneric, viral load after 16-week treatment as such as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenerase, to the most powerful waste of viral load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (Bläomas), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may vary sensitive (allergic) against Amshavir, or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Agenerase is taken in order to pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee concluded that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have any protease inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved by "exceptional circumstances" since at the time of approval of scientific reasons, only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a approval for the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be given to pharmacokinetic booster of Amshavir, together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">Use of Amiavir should be taking into consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The biodegradability of Amshavir as a solution for intake is reduced by 14%; therefore, apple capsules and solution can be used on a milligrams per millimetre basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of Amshavir twice a day together with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Positive capsules without the strengthened addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses have to be applied at Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Amshavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amshavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease Inhibitors were not included in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the error of data to the unthinking and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Acouase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function in patients with severe liver function in patients with severe liver function (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrom P450-Isodoms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, containing curvy (hypertension) may be included, due to the risk of reducing plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amshavir during the intake of Amshavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">The patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy is not to be one of the cure of HIV infection, and that they may continue to develop opportunism or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including the treatment with Ageneric, do not prevent the risk of HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer with an antiretroviral therapy therapy, an increased risk of severe liver abnormality in potentially fatal course.</seg>

<seg id="2052">Ammitavir is made of the solution 14% less bioavailability than the capsules; therefore, apple solution and apple capsules are not available on a milligrams interchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance from Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the impact of a kidney function to Elimination of Amshavir and Ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amshavir, similar to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Amshavir twice daily without simultaneous dosing of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was investigated mainly by the safety of the drug, but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by using its effect in relation to reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the liver cells).</seg>
<seg id="2278">At the end of the study Aldurazyme showed the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme at the age of over five years (more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, Arthropathie (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion location.</seg>

<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically the patients continue to be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be done only in a reasonable clinical environment, in which recovery facilities are available for medical emergency applications.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase forms to form Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients, the antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction, must be treated with caution by Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginale until low-neutral effect on the enzymatic Laronization activity in vitro, which seemed to be the clinical efficacy and / or reduction by GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of adverse authority in connection with the formation of IgG-antibodies in relation to the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The accusation for the enzymes is in one of the hydrolysis of the acute substrated substrates and the accumulation of an additional accumulation of enzymes in the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is absorbed rapidly from the circulation system and of cells into the Lysosomes, most probable by Manners-6-phosphate - receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to recruits the whole of disease's disease, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and only a patient had the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a perfectly expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to walk 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutralization, Thrombozyl, and maximum non-hematology toxicity as they have observed in the previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-oxidants, for neutrropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was taken up if a treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients who are treated with Pemetrexed patients to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- laktical measure on the basis of reducing toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the extra gift of an Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antilock).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended to lie since the effects in this age group are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance in the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as Serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies on 1 842 adults, which received chemotherapy regimen, which are strong and moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, 59% of patients who received chemotherapy for nausea and vomiting which were treated with Aloxi-treated patients (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are treated for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi-treated patients (153 from 189) to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki-Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. an approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is Indian: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in heavily emitted chemotherapy, due to a cancer condition and vomiting for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is inducted by a strong chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can extend the colonic mpassage, patients with anamnestial Obsessions or signs of subacute Ileus to be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, it is possible to extend the addition of Palonosetron with medication that QT interval are extended or in patients where QT- interval is extended or to one such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with another chemotherapy treatment, Aloxi is supposed to be used to prevent the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical trials, Palonosetron inhibit the chemotherapy regimen (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacokineties between one-one intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady edial metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Based on a population-based pharmacokinetic analysis (Amiodara) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodara, dyoxetine, laconavir, sproonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not expected, so Palonosetron should not be used with pregnant women, unless there is necessary to be used by the treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common at a dose of 250 micrograms of patients had a total of 633 patients), at least with Aloxi in connection, headaches headaches (9%) and homeless (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post-market experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins of adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-drug relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies based on the large volume volume, however, is probably not an effective treatment for aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies have received a total of 1.132 mg / m2 of doisoplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin (half hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half hours of 7.3 hours) received intravenous to one day.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, 667 patients who received a strong chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms ponosetron received treatment with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly embodied chemotherapy are consolidated in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc intervals with the appropriate effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the studies of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels at the ventricular De- and Repolarisation of the ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The target of 221 healthy subjects were the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.v. i.o. Palonosetron in single outlets from 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous treatment follows an initiation decrease in the plasma concentration of a slow elimination of the body with an average payout time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentrate-time curve (AUC0- ∞) is generally in general in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 - 90 g / kg for therapy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous treatment of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) in the Palonosetron plasma concentration of 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the daily intravenous treatment of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable at 3 consecutive days; however, the Cmax had a value of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated and roughly 50% will be converted into two primary metastases, which compared to Palonosetron, less than 1% of the effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the metabolism that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of the dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours, Palonosetron, made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a single intravenous investment program, the total body is 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver function for the terminale Eliminationshalbweries and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron, a reduction in the dose is therefore nonzero.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects have been observed, only to expositions, which are considered sufficient to be considered to be sufficient for clinical use of clinical exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical trials showed evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels, which can be involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation process.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose was recorded in about the 30times of the therapeutic exposure of people), endocrine neopes (in thyroid, hypophyse, Pankreas, ouniermark) and skin tumeric in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the high dosages and Aloxi's people used to be a unique application, the relevance of these results will be higher than for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this approval for the transport must bring the European Commission to grant its plans for the application of the application in the context of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2683">The European Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo on short-surface treatment in the following superficiency amounts are: • Impetigo, • positive small Lazeration, checks, or sewn bets.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd., a approval for the transport of Altargo on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients who shows no change within two to three days, should be examined once again and an alternative therapy can be drawn into consideration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitivity or severe local Irritation by the application of Retapamulin sage Salbe, the treatment of salt was carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment in the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections, in which MRSA is known as Erreger (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials, in clinical trials, the efficacy of Retapamulin was induced in patients with infections caused by a methicilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment should be drawn into consideration, if after a 2-3 day treatment does not have no change or deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasmaconcentrations that have been reached in human application on a molded skin or uninfected surface, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo are not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">For simultaneous treatment of 2 times daily 200 mg of Ketoconazol the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamine Salbe moved to healthy skin in healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systematic exposure of patients, dosing is not required for necessary, if topical retapamulin was applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive-drugs according to oral intake and are inadequate response to the birth and the föal / postnatal Development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of retapamulin was the offering of an systemic antibiotic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2696">With the decision to end whether the breastplate was continued / end or completed with Altargo's / end, it should be completed between the benefit of the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo reported the most commonly reported corritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of patients were concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effect of the Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of conromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus) is isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction between the bacterium ribosom, which differs from the binogeneous substances of other ribosses.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bination site ribosomal protein L3 was involved in the region of the ribosomal P-Binder and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Thanks to the bination of inhibiting conrountiline, peptidylation sent to the peptidylation, block interactions and prevent the normal formation of active-inbosbosomaler units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the use of the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin should appear at least some infamous forms, should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the Isolate or resistant against methicillin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-election response to S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-a leucocidin) should be drawn into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin at Salbe daily under Okkludown on intact and down to the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamine Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatively, were won single plasma samples.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed in days 3 or 4 in adult patients each of the median and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on human beings from 1% Salbe to 200 cm2 with molded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamine IC50 for the PGP Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin, primarily by CYP3A4, under small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used for protection against hepatitis B and Hepatitis B (disease, which are related to the liver) in children aged between a 15-year-old, which are not immute to these diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In order of one of two doses, the vaccination plan is applied, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, ambirix must only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection. it is sure that the vaccination can be managed by two doses of the vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collecting dose is given against Hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines affect the immune system (the natural fle of the body), "as it can be against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the immune system of the viruses and surface antigens as a "foreign-d" system.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix, the same components as which has been approved by the vaccines since 1996 and has been approved the vaccine of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given at one of three doses of the vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because amrix and Twinrix are identical ingredients, some of the data which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as a reward for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The principal Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of gmigerm children, which had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional trial with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccination was compared with a six month and a 12 month distance between the two injections was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In ambient temperatures between 98% and 100% of ggerm-age children aged between 98 and 100% of the total injection in the development of protective antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection was similar to ambient temperature in a 6-month and a 12-month distance between the injectors was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of ambient rix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache deficiency, loss of injection, redness, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a approval for the transport of ambirix in the entire region</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunzation with ambient temperature rix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collecting vaccination is required for hepatitis B as well as hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or vaccinated with a combination-defect.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B virus antigen (anti-hepatitis C) and anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are antibodies in the same magnitude with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully backed by the immune system of immunity individuals who need to be vaccinated on a hepatitis C virus, because they are not detectable by the immunological memory for no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How to all injection products should be for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the addition of the vaccine for the medical treatment and monitoring is always available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardised disease is recommended that the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant B-B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemalysis patients and persons with faults of immune system, however, the basic anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies will be achieved in this cases the offering of other vaccine doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the anointed, could lead to a suboptimum Impact success should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders can be injected in order to be injected, as it can be injected in these cases according to intramuscular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2748">In the second of a separate injection system in the form of a separate injection system (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or a combined mascul- Mumps vaccines, was given to the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immune diseases or in patients with immune defective, it may not be sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial dealing with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matness, gastroenttis, headaches and fever comparable with the incidence which was observed in the previous Thiomerage and preservatives-containing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, tolerability of ambience was compared with the 3-doses drop in combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and validity on a computation basis per vaccine dose of rix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the addition of ambient temperatures of 50,7% of the subjects were observed compared to 39.1% during the treatment of a 3-doses drop.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination, 66,4% of the test subjects were given, over pain, compared to 63.8% for the subjects who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matness was similar to the same (i.e. the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received ambient temperatures, compared to 36,2% for the subjects who received the 3-doses drop.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of preluous pain and matness was low and comparable to the dosing of the combination image processing is observed with the 3-doses vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study on 1-11-year-old vacclingen, the occurrence of local reorganisation and general public reactions were comparable with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 mcg of combinant B-B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11- year old, however, it was reported to vaccination with ambient temperature (at the injection) per dosage, not per protape, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations containing severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccinated with ambient temperatures of 360 ELISA and 10 µg combinant units containing hepatitis B virus, was statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, ranging from 1 to 15 years, the Seroconvergence rates for anti-HAV 99,1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second one month (i.e., per month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons, the immunoogenesis evaluable was the Seroprotective rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 in the case of 3-dose-cell material significantly higher than with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune system, which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1-11-year-old one month after distermination of the full vaccination series (i.e. month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2 doses of vaccinated vaccines with a combination of 360 ELISA and a combination-containing hepatitis B virus and 10µg of combinant B-B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of the Grundimmering between 12 and 15 years old, the percussion of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunotherapy with ambient temperatures of 0-6-month vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response was comparable to both antigens which was comparable to vaccination of 3 doses using a combination-containing hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant B-B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial of 12- to including 15-year-old, the damage of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies confirmed 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the 0-12-month vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with canopy, as a risk for the emergence of Öreusulzera if the tablets does not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyphenyrat that corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congenital heart failure or serious renal failure, and with sodium retention and oil formation only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because meterisation and the separation of sodium polyphenyrat over the liver and the kidney, the AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in terms of pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraction (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous treatment of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal loss and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed friction coefficient of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether Phenylacetate is divorced in the breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraction during the postperiod (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events, it was assumed that they did not use with AMMONAPS in connection with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old female patient with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and Pankreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdozing stood at a 5-month-old small child with a accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosislimiting neurons during a intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is of significance that the diagnosis was increased early and treatment to improve the treatment of survival and improve the clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infaust, and the disease himself led to death with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their sticking-free analoga to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium polyphenylate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate) was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (however within the first life months) to 80%.</seg>

<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies show no differences between insurelinglulisin and human rights in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insullulisin into the human breast milk occurs, but in general, insulin occurs in the breast milk, nor will be resorable to oral application.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycerides with consciousness can be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection from Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a qualified person, or by intravenous treatment of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the pri- cause for heavy hypoglycemia and similar episodes.</seg>

<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be carried out by insulin delivery and the drug is shorter than in hu- manem normalization.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged between 21 and 50 years, insulin-treated patients showed disproportionate in therapeutic dosing effect of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg. a relative increase in the gluesthetic effect, precisely as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a double the fast effect as normal human rights and achieves the full glued effect about 2 hours earlier than human being.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was confident that in a application of insulin-glycemic control, a comparable postdenum glycemic control is reached, as is given by a human normalization that is 30 minutes before the meal is given.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Isinglisisisin 2 minutes before the meal, has been a better post-denounce control when the meal was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Soaked in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, insulin is comparable glycemic control such as human normalization that will be given 2 Mi- nants before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in offering 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the meal was given, 30 minutes (normal - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal was given (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normalization that was given 2 minutes (normal - before) a meal was given (figure 1B).</seg>
