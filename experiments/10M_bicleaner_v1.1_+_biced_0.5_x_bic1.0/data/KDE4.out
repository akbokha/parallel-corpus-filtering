an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tization .
modern digital cameras consist of data transfer from Compact &amp; Flash ; memory card and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera can also be realized through the picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its D@@ eri@@ v@@ ate . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
the program g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 is also used for digital cameras that supports a constantly increasing number of digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ erals without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos are linked to the serial port . there are these cameras and displays the transfer of pictures with g@@ Phot@@ o@@ 2 by using a complete list of supported cameras under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be prepared with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , if the Ex@@ if @-@ Support will not be available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might know nothing to be able or might be very slowly .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ tization ; it &apos;s how easy to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common modular structure for and digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Phot@@ o@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide all video programs for the K@@ IP@@ I modules in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way of manipul@@ ate how it can be much easier , and digi@@ tization : through the writing of a small module in order to add a function as the changes in and digi@@ tization .
to get the window to simple , you can remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or remove in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Um@@ sch@@ alt + F .
the drag and place of pictures works everywhere : you can record a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , by the horizontal cutting line or in a different application window . the only limitation is not able in key@@ words , dat@@ or list or search .

what is a digital asset management - off from the fashion sector ? digital inventory . all of the pictures can take up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos can be sc@@ anned or digital photos , but most of us do not make the form of digital asset management , but most of us do not do in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips such as you can download and use the procedure for digital photography . we consider downlo@@ ad@@ able to convert and convert , group@@ ing , secure , rate , ver@@ itable , more and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; digital asset management takes place , Indian , search@@ es , trans@@ forming , trans@@ forming , trans@@ forming , and exported content that have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ adata data are defined as data via data . met@@ adata data are provided according to your definition data , information on or a documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
to claim that , if you have to know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find out more than 1000 photos . however , the approach the met@@ adata both in a database and can be guaranteed very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you have to do and know what you have to keep something up in your system . your image files must decide if you want to store your photos on your photos , you want to back up your own drive or on a grid drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to change sometime in a larger drive .
perhaps you will be happy with this structure . the rest pictures can be found in several times on the same site . if you want to run on your data . if you are using enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . , then a folder for images you will print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements like , for example , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of photos to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files are not re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of data types makes st@@ acking processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and desktop files makes a backup strategy and migration . they always know whether you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save the option Met@@ ad@@ ditions to the file site of the met@@ adata . if you don &apos;t forget , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by using the corresponding point in the menu album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? and we &apos;ll find them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attribute . these are of course the most important .
now you start the real work as you need to select any photo key@@ words , each of course you need to select the same attribute . you will start the best with the rating or leader@@ board . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos .
now let us know it with key@@ boards , key@@ boards , as well as other programs are often called , or categories . all three are Syn@@ ony@@ x for the same thing .
if you want to import the buttons on the right side of the Hier@@ archy of the construction is no problem , and can easily be s@@ worn by using a sub@@ bau@@ ms on a other hand . the modified key@@ words are made of &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated during the lower trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata . this is a very coar@@ se representation , because each block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . data name and calendar data are characteristics of all pictures .
enough of the key@@ words - the next section , refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ ches your met@@ adata .
they want to know most anyone who want to see and share your photos , you want to share your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested as your photos .
look at this panorama . from the Fer@@ ne is not even a nice beach@@ front page . if you look closer to see , you will see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to the landing site of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha beach quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the labelling has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for other photos , the title might be more important than the image himself . if you want to tell you a story , you think about the key to the viewer to help him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand what you understand .
it is in order if a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only work with a labelling material for itself .
you can also export your images in a detailed text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , then you can export them to your wishes regarding the labelling field and / or the title of Web gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you need to tell the story so that it will be a second time .
remember times before GPS ? when you have to find in another city without navigation system ? it was not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures from the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
if you are able to re@@ perc@@ ussions for the future . I am sure that you can open your trips with Google Earth . you can also use the photos at the end of your holiday . you can also export images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Earth viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice the copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedom also apply to all versions , so also for the work of other .
the following description says you the information in the setting side of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when info should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for justice and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organisation can be changed . after this value , it should not be changed for no longer . this field is not supported nor semi@@ col@@ on as a partition .
author of the photographer ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : is linked to the author . examples include the work of the photographer . examples include , as an employee photographer , a freelance photographer and independence of commercial photographer . as this is a memor@@ andum on the auth@@ oring field , this has to be filled .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use this photo is possible to identify the author &apos;s photo agency , as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then you can &apos;t know each other . if the image offers a storage photo here , then the group / agency is offered here .
it is very important to fill the author and Copyright sections , though they don &apos;t provide protection against abuse . every room has a digital water@@ mark . for private individuals this is for the majority of your photos . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . there will be in the near future for such a module for the st@@ acking processing .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same as you can also happen with traditional paper photos or Neg@@ oti@@ ations . in this section it goes to problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data re@@ modeling company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs that you can keep your CDs and DVDs to get more expensive than a few years . there &apos;s offers more than gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 that covers a life of 100 years for themselves . if you think that is in your meas@@ ur@@ b@@ room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk to watch good discs and good recording devices . the best DVD movie devices are not much more expensive than the che@@ ap@@ est , but you don &apos;t write a lot of reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to use . therefore , they are only effective for error , even if you have just written a control mechanism . despite this massive protective suits they are needed by chemical ageing , Ultra@@ violet light , Kr@@ at@@ zer , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheaper program called Iso@@ Bu@@ ster . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it &apos;s also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications for damaged data disks , hard drives , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format of HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is said to be used for Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn your data to watch high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ation format . read the media with a clean , dark dry and in front of the protected area . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media , before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read this media .
disk@@ manufacturer will keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantee a new disk , but not the data . Google introduces a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks : a disc@@ arding study
shortly : dis@@ cos are the most frequent error message in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in the lower temper@@ ate error , SM@@ ART can not recognize the error message . these are particularly reading aid and shift counter . the expected time period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss of low voltage due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also secured data loss because of a power if you secured the files , but this loss can be used without any large problems .
while most electrical devices are no longer enough , the use of devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed scanning , complete data loss , mother@@ boards , mother@@ boards , and other def@@ ective . protect them even before the un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
most of the most widely used protection against electricity flows are an over@@ voltage protection . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . do not remember that any plug @-@ in is also used for over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should be able to pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also be able to make the protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the correct connected devices .
since you can use any cable to your computer , you should be sure that all periph@@ erals can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide easy @-@ to @-@ voltage for your modem . some manufacturers provide easy access to your modem . some manufacturers provide connecting opportunities for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and TV card .
if you &apos;re using a not@@ ebook , you &apos;ll need a portable transfer protection . a multitude of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore very small and you are also included the protection for the modem . this is ideal for you .
while an easy @-@ to @-@ voltage your system could not be used for smaller fluctu@@ ations in power lines . even a fall of few seconds can lead to loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . therefore , it can be useful in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ ten@@ sions , these devices can be downloaded down to the system . if you have a US@@ V , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the life @-@ time of battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
if you use the potential risk to avoid your computer system . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a smaller price @-@ difference if you use . at the end , you should always remember all cables to tr@@ enne before you enter into the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store your amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs . 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the main images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general safety solution . therefore , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services on photos . the professional version will be provided by Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 per year , you are using unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality .
from view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission error occurs thanks to the TCP protocol automatically adjusted and with the large companies are included in the offer of backup and a partial memory .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least the data integral part of operating system and hard disk .
the worst is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred , not only if this is in your box . it &apos;s quite wor@@ rying that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought that the internet with its TCP protocol is a much more safe data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable network components are a further source of transfer rates , as they generate inter@@ e@@ preferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle high levels on low level . it &apos;s open source for solar and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms which used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the core .
these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % for working on . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss because of viruses is less common than the chis@@ el think . it is currently limited to Microsoft @-@ Systems ; Apple users know only a few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; however , no longer has been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the most common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ ted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of rem@@ n@@ ants during a surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file doesn &apos;t work completely stored before the problem is lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras , 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical limits are removed from fundamental physical limits . it is , that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras are getting worse for compact cameras and high quality look . even DS@@ LR cameras have increased its limit for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive can now be responsible for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , you get another data loss in every year . secure your data often by a data loss , and try out this backup just like the new installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks .
suppose you have your sick@@ ness on an external SATA drive . if , one day , a flash , don &apos;t have luck when the drive was not connected during the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot . don &apos;t forget : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ els are dangerous to your data . they are generally dangerous to all the room or the complete house .
therefore Des@@ ast@@ er@@ tification is a non local store . bring your steps to the stairs up to the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above already , is a common reason for a data loss despite back up the panic . if you have a backup is not immediately available , you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot @-@ up without history and represents a complete copy of at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete safety . creates a complete sn@@ apshot of two periods : the complete safety device and the last differenti@@ ation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the final status . this enables the original status on each time again . this backup is used to backup any kind of backup by the exception that it is only ab@@ ast@@ ray and constantly continuously .
rsync is a wonderful small tool that can be easily changed to your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts . this happens to be compressed and if you want to increase the safety via ss@@ h .
secure key images directly after you have stored on your computer , a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and produce back . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot @-@ up for each month . any further expansion should be done manually , after which you have a complete review .

thus valuable pictures the next 40 year survive , that is about the period of time you are interested in you , because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be applied :
since the future is expected to be pre@@ dict@@ able . unfortunately , there is no other way to be able to consider it . unfortunately , there are no other chance to ask for any time of certain resources . however , there are no other variations in the past . however , less variations in the past , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explan@@ ations in this document . use or change any standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then do it and install it into a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safegu@@ ard technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability for the possibility of changing a system in size . this means that means , whatever .
let us go out that you want the scal@@ ability to en@@ force the scal@@ ability , or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store the new record for a new record :
check the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but hang them not .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; No ; size of the plate in MB@@ U ; does not work with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; Dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / cor@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS .
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have any software that can read it , then you can create these himself . this task will be easier by year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format the slowly away from the market . you should not use it anymore .
PN@@ G was developed as an open source standard . it may be loss @-@ free , XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs , but not as many as T@@ IFF needs and a slow compression information . this format we would like to recommend you to your images .
T@@ IFF was widely distributed as image format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression ( default ) . however , it is possible that this format has been adapted to many people . so there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digital input file format is a licence @-@ free and an open source format designed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now available on the T@@ IFF / EP format . DN@@ G is now available , and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why , in 2001 to replace its XML @-@ based XMP technology ; it allows users to modify their data into a file @-@ c@@ ots . the file information will be stored on the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the XML / R@@ DF file .
many photographers make it possible to archive your image file , mostly in the raw file . however , it can be stored at the link between the met@@ adata and image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization that support an open @-@ compatible online met@@ adata fields , annual conferences and workshops in the D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and re@@ conn@@ ect@@ ations to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or sc@@ anners . so long the images on the camera , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save this in your own archive . this function is not implemented .
for a hos@@ tile process , you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you should add the met@@ adata . these were cut under circumstances of the other programs .
protect the added images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact covers , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can add a description on your hard disk . the camera interface offers you as many advanced settings to imp@@ ose images of your Alb@@ end@@ ship database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can connect them with the computer , switch the camera to display mode and switch them . another description you will find in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , when you want to connect a while . some cameras are displayed at the bottom of the camera . if this is the case , fil@@ en@@ ame and a symbol of file association settings for any file , photos , films , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need to download the camera information on each entry . with the side of the features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single agreement or its met@@ adata .
this dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information , internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image can &apos;t be downloaded yet on your computer . please note that in some digital cameras not all the information available .
the rider met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata , such as Ex@@ if , manufacturers of manufacturers , GPS , etc . , for the same information , the same as at the met@@ adata fields from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization : or image editing . please note that these met@@ adata with some digital cameras are not available .
the easi@@ est way to download photos on your computer , click the click on to download and download the photos from their camera . to download the photos will not be deleted , and we recommend you to check out the pictures from their camera to delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download any photos , you can select the desired number of your choice methods . as soon as you can download the button , then you can download the button , then you can download the button out as long as you have chosen some photos .
if your camera is to download it is a Option . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tization . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you can download the buttons for download or out , a dialogue may be stored in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums will be shown in the Section AM albums , and select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; invites the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can remove this from the camera to er@@ ase you . if you want to er@@ ase your button . if you want only delete some er@@ ase you , you need to select these first and then select ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
note that there are no chance to be deleted from the camera , and they will be completely deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the photos from the camera . if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , use the camera , as it is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos are often deleted from the camera . this can be upgraded to double data , if you can download photos of different recording holidays in the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time where the image was done to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotation and spi@@ es of the image and for dat@@ alo@@ es . if you are using this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer open three further options being performed before the photos stored on the disk . if you choose this , the entries can be copied to the IP@@ TC fields in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option , you can correct date at time for all downloaded images .
if you want to use another file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % 100 % S . switch to this option and time you can add the date of time . for more customi@@ z@@ ations , you should read the help of the report .
if you want to use the Camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you can change the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in case letters . or in big book@@ ings , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which was used ; for a photo is displayed below the name , the camera is stored in a preview . your settings can be saved and automatically , if you open the next time the camera will open the camera .
there are all information about the orientation of the camera to take @-@ out , an automatic spin @-@ out during the way . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side bar met@@ adata , you can find more details about the information that made your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched , and if your camera does not supplies this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the f@@ enst@@ ers .
if your camera was done on the date back to the photo album , it can be loaded to the image . all images are stored on the same day . not all cameras will be available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side bar met@@ a data , you can read more information about the camera into the photos .
this option is usually switched off and in this case , the photos are directly inside the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button extension and select the option Dat@@ ums@@ based on the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
the easi@@ est way to upload photos from their computers on their camera is loading . select the file @-@ up dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can select the files stored on your camera . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ ous ; you will be uploaded to the pictures . if you select the desired folder and press OK , please enter the desired folder and press OK . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept for this document . this is meant to be displayed in length and lati@@ tude , and can be displayed on a map by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographer it can be interesting to use a picture with a precise and quiet place . not everyone is an aircraft to drive through an automated recording of the GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architectural office and real estate ma@@ kler can be able to use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , you can open this photo by clicking to another &amp; digi@@ tization . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization . if you want to document the site of the photos , it is easy to document or just this aspect , it &apos;s good to connect the posi@@ tional data of a photos .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that there are only three ways to reach it . directly with the right hardware , using a re@@ editing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical access ( manual ) and most recently over the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there are no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receiver . either as a map module or via the transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G3 Sony
downlo@@ ading the GPS data can be done by a device with g@@ ps@@ man or G@@ PS@@ Babel . they need to save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical conditions .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from images and of GPS are cor@@ related . on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and break @-@ grade or other data , you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harvey . it uses the correct coordinates , which are created for example of proteins s.@@ goo@@ gle .
contains no European road types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all navigation details for Europe show .
there are many settings to enter the behaviour of the contents . there are many settings that change the behavior of and digi@@ tization . in order to select the settings the settings can be divided into eight pages . you can choose between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left .
action can select pre @-@ embedded preview or image editing , set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you click on a entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , standardi@@ zation and focus data . these data will be chosen automatically into the corresponding IP@@ TC fields , using a database synchron@@ isation . these data will be syn@@ onymous with a database synchron@@ isation .
author &apos;s title is syn@@ onymous with the photographer : this field should contain professional photographer as well as a freelance photographer , a freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is an additional description to the author &apos;s field , this also should be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify this photo options , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then this image should be entered . if the picture is a storage photograph , then the group or agency should be provided by the picture .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this met@@ adata functions also included in the database . these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tization . without any problems are lost .
image interpret@@ ations as embedded manifest@@ ations ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ ized the comments you can also be read with the pictures . attention : images that already include labelling , these are already written by the digi@@ tization .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse but@@ cher is on the main window on a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and a number of video formats . to specify which file extensions added this list and remove the file extensions . each file in one &amp; digi@@ tization ; Alb@@ um@@ man , which has no enh@@ ancements , will be ignored and ignored .
the default settings can be returned back again by using the kno@@ cking out of each category .
these settings can be switched on the standard values . each other pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have only use the option &amp; quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better starting results .
by default , the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer another color , you can choose this here . you can use the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ lined areas of a picture can be selected with dark and brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . this colours can be specified here . in image processing , this enrich@@ ment can be switched off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ aires . please refer to this article in Wikipedia are the following statement .
with the PN@@ G @-@ files you can reduce the size of PN@@ G @-@ files . the only effect is that the image data can be used . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can put this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 is a high compression .
with the T@@ IFF file compressed you can switch the default value of T@@ IFF file for T@@ IFF pictures . this is the size of T@@ IFF pictures . it has no effect on image quality , since the default algorithm is free .
with the loss of los@@ s@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can choose loss @-@ free loss . even if you have posted los@@ s@@ worn setting , the ratio was not supported between quality loss and file size . if it was written , met@@ adata were not supported , but it was not included in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tization ; the image processing only worked for photos . currently , it was too fast to create a tool to manipulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , if you use this problem with minimal loss of details . this option is a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gears with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white arrow is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map drawn up in the sun light .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that the images can get more details in four steps more details . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ off , so that parts of your images put the top @-@ out white into the settings . in order to solve some unusual results , since it shows the top @-@ lights in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . most recently , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the hair@@ s .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w try the lack of green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to select the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually to each picture .
set the L@@ umin@@ ance for your taste . however , you have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be made later in the picture options of the digi@@ os@@ ing ; however , to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing small , you should go conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ ic@@ ing algorithm is a digital image process in order to detect a complete picture of the data @-@ based image sensor that offers lots of cameras and a matrix @-@ colour pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ re@@ structure .
there are three alternatives for me : bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ N@@ G inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it produces some of color images that are looking for me . bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening , as you will be converted during the raw convertible .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how these again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; for information about the colour space of an colour space in the other , so the colors are as accurate as possible .
questions , if a picture in image editing is opened / color management module with raw files .
you can save the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , which allows you to store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tization : these folders will then be added during the starter .
settings of the ICC profiles , they have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . all you can change in opening of the crude file , later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images , manages the entire screen .
the input profiles should be prepared for the same way as Canon , which do not use any color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correction factor . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not apply for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which can be em@@ ulate as your image can be given back as your printer , as your printer commands a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors . this could be correct , rather than to leave the blind algorithm in your printer .
most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is provided for them . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . unfortunately , a table of cameras and profiles are together fit here . this answer is of course un@@ official :
Canon profile extension can be seen for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plu@@ gin interface . it &apos;s an interface to support from a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; lots of modules support , which have been written to support with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . choose from &amp; digi@@ tization . this modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main f@@ enst@@ ers and beyond . in addition , you will also see the menu menu of the menu .
short @-@ orders for tasks , which can be carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu under settings .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ates the time between the screens , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check@@ boxes are made in the met@@ adata or , which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
on the left @-@ hand side of all cameras that are connected to the computer . if you want to make sure that the camera is connected to the computer . if you are connected , the camera switches to be connected , and on the picture settings . currently , you are using the settings , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active when you have a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / or / m@@ nt / m@@ nt that depend on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you have to connect the camera with your computer to display mode in display mode .
Pro@@ bi@@ ere you come out of whether and digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically recogn@@ ises . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu .
you can choose any of any word for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu of the main f@@ enst@@ ers . if you own more than a camera , you can add all the here .
with the option of the option dialog for the insert of &gt; images in the gar@@ ages , you can set the disc@@ ern@@ ing of &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the sol@@ ves of a photos in a album set . in the intervals of a photos and del@@ eting of a album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down with and digi@@ tization . if you use the changes in the right side bar without back questions . otherwise you need to store the changes to the button changes .
you can also use the display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ tization ; when sub@@ types , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ tization under circumstances .
the setting up start to new pictures are looking for new photos . this will extend the start time of &amp; digi@@ tised ; if anything out of the base file was deleted , the digi@@ ti@@ ner was removed ; and if something from the base file is deleted , we &apos;ll see if it is out of the database .
different color schem@@ atics can be used in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to choose the main window to your taste . this settings can choose among the design of the tool bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in simple text files ; you &apos;ll find more information about this tut@@ orial .
digi@@ tization : contains a rapid image processing with some base tools . you can use these images to view and enhancing your photos . the image processing can be started using a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and Sel@@ ection of the entry @-@ file format .
the image processing contains a series of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available in &amp; digi@@ tization . so , under circumstances are not part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the image processing .
a status line at the lower edge of the fish , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , En@@ tran@@ ce factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool for quick access to the most common functions .
the processing functions of image processing will change your photos . however , the original photo is changing , before you can use File or the button compatible with the tool you can &apos;t use the original photo soon as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should insert a copy of your image , before you change it . you can change your file with your file as perform .
as long as you have not stored it , you can manufacture the original photo by using the menu file , ren@@ ditions to the button . you lose any change in the tool@@ bar . you lose any change that you have at the photo since the last store .
almost any action of image processing can be re @-@ made and restored and restored . the last action can be back or restored , by combining editing , or be restored by using the menu .
if you use this often , you should use the keyboard @-@ shorter , c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to re @-@ end and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ to re@@ plen@@ ish .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB in the tool@@ bar or restart button on the tool you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entry , all actions are also made in between and restored and restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same sample , by using the navigation device in the tool . if you are using changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can go to the photo in and out of zo@@ oms in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ rad or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the saf@@ er menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can adjust this button in the tool bar : En@@ tran@@ ce factor automatically choose
view full screen mode the photo is displayed in full screen mode . if you are not interested , you can change this in the settings dialog elements of &amp; digi@@ tization . you can call them out of the web press ; main window will see the main window .
if you want to print your current image , you can choose in the menu file , select the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can choose individual pictures or whole sets . all images can choose from your selection . you need to select the images with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the top side is the main window on the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation system , also available in image processing , it will be indicated when one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked :
multiple click on the same rider the side bar appear , and disappear again in the edge of disappear .
please note the note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used . the labelling is copied into EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are complete according to 2000 characters and are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field applications in other applications , you should consider this limitations .
after you comments , you will either use the button application or change it to the next image , the labelling will then be stored .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . it is always done if you have chosen a met@@ adata setting , which is always written in the pictures .
the section evaluation shows a rating of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ row . it can be used to evaluate a single mouse click on the side street or with the key@@ boards . in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously , select these images and use the context menu .
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ box ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box for fil@@ ming the key@@ words , the key@@ word , and a selection box with the previously published in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session at the session .
the key@@ word is fully adapted to the en@@ able search@@ light . you can quickly access the number of opportunities in search for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of key@@ words .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of key@@ boards at a photo series . if you have a variety of key@@ words , these are stored for fast access .
key@@ words can also be stored by marking the appropriate cross @-@ fields in the tree . all key@@ words of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures are selected in the main view , and you will select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , and not on the entire selection , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the paragraph filter .
the side@@ wall filter is used to change the pictures below . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - data , key@@ words and view@@ ings . if in addition there is a or multiple sample filter from the right side , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed .
you can also use key@@ words and put it in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can go out of the right side table and to choose from the selection . then a dialogue , which you ask , whether you want the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window is shown in a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is chosen on a sample of three images . they have been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a sample from the right key@@ word is pulled to the selection and there . a dialogue is asking whether this key@@ word will be set .
these search for changes are held at each Start of the program . it can also be eliminated in settings .
if you have a rule with and created that it should be one or should be able to change it with a double click on the text and control section .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be a album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument of the Oper@@ ator , which is a name or a character , which is already set in the database .
you can choose for example a Advanced Search search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want options to use options , you only need the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then click the button . the options see then follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r is not listed ? the free memory space is limited to 1 GB , and you don &apos;t want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . particular thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have been mainly related to and digi@@ tization ; for concrete implementation .
the reason why you can use a color@@ able deviation from the camera or sc@@ anned colours . in the same way or scanner , you can install the colors on your monitor or sc@@ anners of the same or sc@@ anners , or the colours that are in the web or in the web .
if the topic on color management would like to know what buttons have to say . unfortunately , the meaning of this tut@@ orial is to provide sufficient background information on color administration . in addition , the links with the lower information allow you to make your own account you will receive the desired results for your own account .
if your image workflow is fulfilled all six below , then you don &apos;t have to take care of color management .
you work on a monitor &apos;s monitor on the s@@ RGB colour space is calibr@@ ated . ( more information can be found below )
your only other major editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is so well working and the life for all so simple , why should you use another colour space and do you need to make your thoughts over the color intensity ?
a visual example of the liqu@@ e@@ ation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see the hu@@ fe@@ ather @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , so please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms and click on Information and then to info about RGB working groups .
must I install my monitor if I decided to work just in the RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not , you need to get your monitor . if you want to work in the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard k@@ alli@@ gator , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . use it , before you try to try out a further manual test .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automatic gearbox and contrast extend out of the menu cor@@ ds , try to make automatically the best of your colours . they have to have experiment@@ ing with these effects to see what &apos;s best on your photo .
norm@@ alized : this method scal@@ p the light , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as light as possible without its color sh@@ ady . this function is often an essential correction for images that are dark or balanced .
Ab@@ same : this method uses the same number of pixels . sometimes , the same number is possible to improve the same number of pixels . sometimes , there is a very good results in the improvement of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that is either a miracle done with a picture .
automatic : this method uses the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determin@@ es the dark and bright limit of light and adjust the red , green and blue channels on the complete Hi@@ sto@@ gram .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a re@@ ji@@ us@@ ability of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be good correction for poor photos .
the White Paper came from &amp; digi@@ tization ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos .
the White equ@@ als is limited to about a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can occur in case of the original photo , if you can perform the white balance out in the rough mode , which will be in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities are better to be better .
this tool is based on a Weiß@@ ab@@ bot Pri@@ mary of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start using the menu entry colors white like the image editing .
the pre@@ set can be adjusted in size . on the left side , the original image can be adapted to the setup of the material . if you want to view the original whi@@ tish , then it is enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target company has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel graphics is displayed as vertical line at Hi@@ sto@@ gram .
right at the right is a Hi@@ sto@@ gram , however , is very helpful , as soon as you are able to change the parameters , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance . with a button , you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the sh@@ adows is made , you can improve the shadow details of your photos or even down .
sc@@ stat with the above mentioned controls , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere you can use the colour temperature for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of the White Vision . this species will also be set automatically at the temperature and green values .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the superi@@ ority increased the colors , if more than a color channel of pixel error occurs . you &apos;ll get the combined result in the White Paper . this is displayed in the preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons store as well as shop is exactly this . every adjustment of the white balance you can set up in a text file , and back later .
the kno@@ b range , all filter values are back on their standard values and of a neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings are another photo as your original . if you save this store your original file .
you can adjust the Ko@@ di@@ fication deep per colour channel . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . these codes are also necessary for PN@@ G , PN@@ M , T@@ IFF and DN@@ G formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue as well as the editing of colour profiles . it can be used by the under@@ side of color profiles . a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be used as a detailed instructions for use of color profiles .
another important tool is available to adjust several color channels at the same time . this tool is helpful if your camera or sc@@ anners are always able to use the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual of the visual correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful option of exposure problems is correc@@ ted the tool to gra@@ dation , that you find in colours of gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool colour is provided for you four colour effects , a Solar@@ an effect , a Ne@@ on effect and an edge filters available .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ is also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of the image produced . it was the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dark@@ er and the colours . the result was a partial negative picture of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image , which is possible to generate a negative output , that &apos;s not on phot@@ op@@ aper in phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar cell effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid @-@ filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation , that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours and gl@@ aring . try it easy to learn more and many photos .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot is made up of daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make him to the film &apos;s choice for natural phot@@ ograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as is strongly saturated and some phot@@ ograph@@ ers , especially those of which hardly any landscapes .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast carriers . the parameters level controls the brightness of the Ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . with great images the filter can offer the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have any problems with light conditions and the light intensity of your photos . you can view the different colors in the menu . as soon as you are satisfied with the result . as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you want to get a photo at bad lighting conditions , you can reduce the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation and you can view it in the preview . if that &apos;s the result you can change the amend@@ ments to O@@ k .
between complex products Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ cine / contrast / gamma , the tool is based on improving the exposure time . even if the dialogue is very complicated , you need to use the application areas only the range of valve . concrete the three shooting down below the Hi@@ sto@@ program .
the window includes a Graph@@ ite of intensive values , one Hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active edge as well as the selected area . under the graph@@ s there are three shooting down to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the light areas .
the easi@@ est way to learn the control is to shift to shift , and make it possible to pay attention as the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynami@@ cally , using the settings of the image , updated on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this select box can be displayed if the hi@@ sto@@ gram features a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures the large areas of a constant colour , the linear Hi@@ sto@@ gram is dominated by one single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic distribution is useful .
three regulator : the top for the dark sounds , the medium sounds , and the lower tones for the medium sounds , often called Gam@@ bling values .
the three colour twe@@ ez@@ ers can be used in the preview of the original version to adjust the input of the shade , medium and light sounds automatically . moreover , there is a button for a fully automated alignment .
pay@@ out : the output values are used to change the output values for each area . there are also two buttons to change the output application . the compression of the output can be used , e.g. for example , a light image can be used as background while something different in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button , the image values will automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save up and store : with these buttons , the introduced values are stored in fil@@ esystem , and later again , the Gim@@ p levels is used .
if you want to use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , you want to use the colour pi@@ p@@ ette , then you want to use the preview of the original value of the door program for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ flow control panel controls all color channels to be transmitted pixels , and you can indicate the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below , you see an example for the alignment of the input . the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output are unchanged . the original size is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target image shown here . the preview will be dynami@@ cally on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
upgrade channel : this select box allows the channel to specify the channel by the module :
besides this cheese , two symbols are possible to change between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . mostly the linear mode of sen@@ are mode produces a broad beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is further developed .
when you shift to the right , e.g. the light sounds , the light sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with dark@@ er views and the related image pixels can be dark@@ ened .
on the preview of the original photo is a red way@@ mark . if you want to change this mark , the right line is displayed on the curve . create a point on this line and move it on this line and move the value to your taste .
save up and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that can be stored in fil@@ esystem , and later , the file format is stored in the fil@@ esystem format .
when you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , you can use the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and sun . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
if in more than one channel over@@ fill monitoring , all colour channels can be found in more than one channel , you &apos;ll get the combined result . this is a indicator , meaning you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below , you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was fixed in the L@@ umin@@ ating channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the paint pi@@ p@@ ette and it is applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ Mixer of &amp; digi@@ tization ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels , or change the color sh@@ elling of the photos .
the channel Mixer is a further developed tool to blend the colour shades of pictures . you can view it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel @-@ dial box you can select the color for the Hi@@ sto@@ gram : to correct the channels by using the relative distribution and precipitation . the left area of the box shows you a preview of The original can be seen as a result of the own riders .
the preview of the objective features a red marker . if you read this in the image , vertical line will appear in the Hi@@ sto@@ gram , to give you the appropriate color value .
the controls are set right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to modify the option of Mon@@ ochro@@ me , because the channel bl@@ ender will then be able to generate this tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you come Mon@@ ochro@@ me , which comes from a little noise , which can still occur in every channel . if the case is differently , you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so that you can reduce the colour space .
the storing as and store buttons are precisely for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setup can be back later and then invite you to save . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
the option over@@ flow control panel controls all color channels to be transmitted pixels , and you can indicate the combined result of all channels . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final results .
below , you can see a photo shown in the blue channel . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original version is under ( 1 ) and the be@@ ware picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ cts . with the development of the digital photography , black / white work is step , as colour images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film scre@@ enings .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film coating with a green lens filters . it looks good to portraits in all scen@@ eries and plays a very good portrait against the sky . therefore , like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filters .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filters . it improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) or@@ ge@@ Filter .
rot@@ ate : simul@@ ates a black / white film scre@@ enings with a red lens filters . this creates a dramatic watch effects and can simul@@ ate moon lists to the day . so , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ Filter .
white filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates hot light and medium sounds when he add a bit cold in the sc@@ andal . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and this is similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ tization ; tool Tex@@ ture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting , a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for image processing .
relief : drive this parameter to the right increases the depth of depth and three @-@ dimensional texture to the picture .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original version is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set on 200 .
with the digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame in order to be added .
the eye of a viewer came into the borders of a photos . this is a psychological barrier to set the picture . this is a psychological barrier to be set . under the picture frame , the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter , fill the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce converted it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , emul@@ ating it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame as well as decoration .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
this is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool for the aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can add simple form@@ att@@ ed text in an image to any time . this goes even in several places when you need it .
this tool is easy to use and place it with the mouse . use the text size , orientation , colour from the colour space and the character set . if you need the picture , the larger must be the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting which can be chosen for your text , can be changed to the kno@@ b &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture once was saved , the text is part of the image . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
with the digi@@ tization ; tool mold , you can apply a template about a picture .
the menu item Sch@@ abl@@ one can be used in image processing , to lay templ@@ ates over a picture .
there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . if you want to add your templ@@ ates ( 9 ) . if you want to add your templ@@ ates , please send an e @-@ mail in English to take delivery of the digi@@ tization ; mail@@ ing list digi@@ tization @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you want to use this tool , you must select your template @-@ file with the kno@@ b @-@ file in the dialogue . select the folders in which you get the template @-@ files . these settings are required for the next start .
after the root committee for the template has been set out of a building view , which is re@@ printed on the Regul@@ atory structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ el &apos;s file . the selection of a Ord@@ way is updated and re@@ viewing the templ@@ ates .
under the preview there are three buttons for you to change the En@@ tran@@ ce factor and change the position of your image .
enlarge : this button becomes the lower picture . it is used around the position of mouse , check it with the left mouse button .
disc@@ ern@@ ing : this button cl@@ amping in the mouse picture . if you want the template for the mouse , if you want the template on the whole image , you must use the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
sent out this button to shift the picture below the template . take the picture and put it to the desired position .
use OK if you want the templ@@ ates on your image . the image will then be adapted to the pre@@ amp size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tool for sharp@@ ness . each of you have advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ es is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s very fast and simple , but especially in dark areas , approved pictures .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness @-@ Mas@@ ke works on the contrast of edges . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psychological Dun@@ st and it makes it a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and he is protected by Winston Chang .
focus is probably the best of the three , because he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digi@@ tised images need a common color . this is the same phenomenon which can be printed in a common color . the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more continuously than normal cameras for the private users .
in JPEG images , JPEG images often have been applied to the camera . pictures in the raw materials must always be shot during the processing .
some sc@@ anners are able to use a sharp@@ ness already during the read of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will receive your image over your image .
in some situations you can obtain usable , by clicking a photo with sharp@@ ening @-@ throwing c@@ utter@@ ing . you can connect to the menu entry to conducting sharp@@ ness .
you should make sure that the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness of a picture increases the edge of the edges , but it &apos;s the tool to focus a picture on the menu . you can find more information about the menu entry . you &apos;ll find more information and a comparison of all techniques .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p@@ y . use the tool to add a bit soft as it . use the tool to add cor@@ nerst@@ ones with the menu on the right side of the di@@ alo@@ gy show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ets is a very good tool to remove it from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original photo and the preview we help the picture . the pre@@ dat@@ sch@@ ster shows the edition of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount of the amount is going to make the effect . if you make the un@@ tigh@@ ter mask , you &apos;ll be able to create and generate the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius is a like many pixels on each side of the filter affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ators . they should be more accurate images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the spo@@ iled image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and a difference between the maximum amount of filter . thus , this way can be used with a soft change between the tones of visual acuity and hence f@@ law error in core , Himm@@ ler and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the be@@ ating picture ( 2 ) . not sharp m@@ asked with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focus is focused on a picture of improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the ur@@ ging protected protected filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to achieve a picture at &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on a photo . it is using a technique as easy to try . it is usually better outcomes than un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start it out of the menu by using colours re@@ focus in image editing .
in practice the circular form is much better than the palate . the palate is going far away from the source pix@@ . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ l &apos;@@ schen F@@ illing is affected in most cases , even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular ring . it is the most important parameters for use this module . the default value is 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp , but if your image should be very sharp on holy .
correlation : the correlation can help produce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . Brau@@ ch@@ able values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the tough@@ est effect of the module .
to help speed filters can help speed up to 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 becomes the image quality very po@@ or@@ ly . a convenient value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still remaining .
Gau@@ di &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate . use this parameter to 0 . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid di@@ gesti@@ ble Art@@ ef@@ acts . if you are able to use a value zero , you may have to increase the correlation between correlation and / or oder@@ m .
mat size : this value is determined by the size of the transformer , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . however , note that the module will select great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the storage as and store buttons will be used exactly to this purpose . any process focus is set , so that it will be stored for later and then can then be loaded .
try all train cutting , color and intensive courses on the picture before you use the module .
otherwise you should use the module , before you change the image , before you change the picture , but the reason is that much operations changes are not visible immediately , but later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed picture .
generally , un@@ sharp results produces better results as a sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the sharp m@@ ask@@ ets to be used as a sharp@@ ness .
theore@@ tically , it must be used to remove the effect . even under optimum conditions it may be possible to remove the optimum L@@ ine@@ are filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Viennese Fil@@ ters always be at least as good as the tough@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often better than the editing of small details .
below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , displayed on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image can be correc@@ ted . this image has been done with a analog camera . the invisible result is due to un@@ sufficient light to the car focus .
for more information on the methods to sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ators , the un@@ tigh@@ tening of the area has been removed , in order to create a natural p@@ ill of natural p@@ ill .
the color tin@@ ktur enables a adapted color for the p@@ ill . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image is one of the most widely developed tool to remove the desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different memory settings as a Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider G@@ etting and Advanced Settings .
details en@@ vis@@ ors &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . however , a small value leads mainly hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous areas . if a value of 0,9 should obtain more details . please note that there is no sharp@@ ness to be needed . please note that the details of the direction would always be ordered .
the value of response to Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value of only in all directions ; and if you have a film liqu@@ or or CCD Rau@@ schen , a high value of plastic patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are given the best at a value near to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum G@@ lä@@ tt@@ ation factor above all@@ ying . then put these value for the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies larger structures . this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbine effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : is going to run as often the algorithm used . usually , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle distances da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ia alpha . if alpha is too small , should be too small to make sure small angle may generate a long time . so , you should select this value so as possible and needs your needs .
integ@@ rators &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integral parts in pixel pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel genes and never should never be larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More on quality you get through the selection of this option is only low . it doubled but the term . we recommend him to allow him .
the buttons storing and store exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very quickly with the work . however , it can still take a long time , and a high CPU load will take place . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ ck .
below , you can remove how image errors can be correc@@ ted with a analogue camera . as you see , there is a stand @-@ like species in the fore@@ ground that was caused by a bad film storage during the trip ( The original version is below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization is a very powerful tool to reduce its base . it uses a tro@@ duction of protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool sel@@ ectable image filters are available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair in the lens . it can also be used to remove the sensor from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ es ; effects of inj@@ ected images from books and magazines .
if you need more information about sensor @-@ cameras from digital cameras , you can read this in this tut@@ orial to this tut@@ orial .
this screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a non @-@ smoking space that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the lower window , the settings can remain in standard settings .
radius will be used to filter the filter size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used to filter the filter per pixel , and the image can be moved through the radius and the color in him will be di@@ mmed and therefore smaller error occurs .
sharp@@ ness is sharp@@ ness . if it increases the pixel distance to be removed . if you need to adjust the edges , you may need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can &apos;t get more and lubric@@ ating or lubric@@ ating or lubric@@ ating or lubric@@ ating .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or stored tips , and you can remove it to a value near the maximum level , if you want to remove a gu@@ arded Rau@@ schen or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts without details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or light@@ ness , to improve a picture . these settings affect no less cat@@ ches that will be controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or light@@ ness , to improve a picture . these settings affect no less cat@@ ches that will be controlled by the details settings .
gamma : controls the gamma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark@@ er areas , which are typically stronger , however , even the shadow fields .
absorption : controls the alignment of the phase radius on variations . if it is increased , the edges can occur when he is able to occur . if he will occur on the edges , Rau@@ schen and phase j@@ itter can occur on the edges . it can be noise and is the recommended method .
store and store : these buttons can be used precisely for this buttons . all parameters to be saved , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later .
this is an example of how to change your life can change your life . the original size is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted with ( 2 ) . the tank was used with standard settings .
sometimes it is a picture to draw for your purpose . do not use a bit soft as a picture . use the tool to add cor@@ nerst@@ ones with the menu entry , and experim@@ ented with the rest of the di@@ alo@@ gy . the effect on the right side of the di@@ alo@@ gy shows the effect of this surgery on your photo .
the &amp; contents came ; photo rest@@ ration is definitely one of the most developed tools around photo art@@ ef@@ ace .
this filter for restoration gives you a lot of undes@@ i@@ ous art@@ ef@@ acts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the photography , original or subsequent digit@@ ally digit@@ ally images to remove . the pu@@ ff takes place along the image and receives the contents of the human eye as it makes human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the algorithm for rest@@ oring is carried out by the IMA@@ GE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ rich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ability record : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas of them . when a low @-@ loss of compression has produced some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture . this adjustment should be correc@@ ted this problem .
the buttons store as well as shop is exactly this . each setting of photography restoration can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later .
photo rest@@ ration is compar@@ atively very quickly with the work . however , it can still take a long time , and a high CPU load will take place . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see how a photo with equ@@ ine Rau@@ schen .. The module is supported on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ orious film experience on the core . the original image is below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted under ( 2 ) .
below , you can see a further example for the photography restoration . this time tex@@ tures can be used on an old color photo that has been used with a sc@@ ep@@ aper screen . the original image can be seen from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and correc@@ ted the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows them to remove it into a CCD camera to remove from the J@@ P@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode , because many cameras with JPEG compression on a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ tra@@ ps . there is no manual method to select the poor pixels .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with the button image . the tool will be able to recognize the hot and bright pixels . this will be highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to explore the dark @-@ set directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD @-@ defect .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark@@ er image . an automatic processing of dark image becomes the bad pixels . note that the assistant is the last dark @-@ image , and this automatically invites you to the next meeting again .
the image range and the preview will help you correct within the image . pre@@ dat@@ sch@@ ster shows the issue of fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are in all pre@@ dic@@ tive areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pixel blocks . these are available for filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is an average of the neighboring villages . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels is calculated by a distance of 1 pixel block on the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . this will be used to cross the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block was to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to calculate the def@@ ective pixels in block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , of a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , and the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization ; Vign@@ et@@ ination correction is a tool to correct the Vign@@ et@@ op , i.e. , under@@ cut corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle objects , in particular in the middle and large photo format , often the entire sensor range is not ev@@ enly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reach the corners and edges in the image by setting the light to the sensor . Tel@@ e@@ objects can also show this behavior .
however , it does not require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the ap@@ ert@@ ing filter , which is necessary to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle objects should also be used , even with center filter , a opening of f / 16 or less , because otherwise un@@ tigh@@ tening effects arise .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter transformation through this filter and is used to simul@@ ate the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the Vign@@ et@@ era correction filters , and three other exposure of the target .
density : this parameter is controlled by the highest density at the point of the highest density . the standard density is 2.0 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for an optic disc size from 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of Vign@@ et@@ tation , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree of degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and gamma settings : do not need to adjust the value of the image by using these options . you need to adjust the exposure of the target product using these options . the pressure regul@@ ates you only positive values , since you need to increase the settings .
if you want to upgrade the exposure of exposure to the target , let the values for illumination / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing of the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ree correction for an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ted image . a lumin@@ aires and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ tization : lens di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a legally binding algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric notes . color@@ ings can not be correc@@ ted with this tool .
the coefficient of the second Gra@@ des deals with the general geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cre@@ ave form of the image .
the coefficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar round effect , however , is applied to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ted the remote edges in the second ridge . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion can be eliminated nearly eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion in the second Gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ gs can be correc@@ ted and positive values .
corner : this value is controlled by the strength of the di@@ stortion . this value acts stronger at the edges as in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameters the symbol of the parameter General .
zoom : this value added the image size and leads a correction of the first gra@@ dation by . negative values also increase the picture .
bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you the best filter settings , illustrated the slide with a preview of de@@ valuation correction factor . the values can be used for your image , and are stored in the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ gs - or k@@ is@@ sen@@ g correction should be carried out prior to all train - or dimensions of changes . if you need to cut this correction than all the first . if you need a picture of new correc@@ t@@ ally and afterwards a ton@@ ally @-@ like correction would be the effect of the Fal@@ sche .
to help you the best correc@@ tions for you . move the mouse to be fixed in your image , and press the left mouse button to fixed the lines at this site . furthermore , you can connect the ton@@ gs / k@@ is@@ cation @-@ shaped di@@ stortion with the help of the lines .
if you have a k@@ is@@ cation @-@ shaped di@@ stortion , the resulting pic of black corners . you can remove this with the cutting @-@ cutting tool in the menu and remove the image processing or via the zoom regulator to this di@@ alo@@ gs .
the next logical step is sufficient for the images . the next logical step for some motifs , as well as recordings from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective at the picture 90 degrees . please note that when you hold the camera with the hand , you will always hold a slight dip in the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ gs @-@ shaped correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original version is under ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ted image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ inf@@ ra film of the G@@ imp@@ belt film . the filter re@@ manufactured by the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ ther@@ rar@@ ot@@ movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the box , you can select the range for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters to simul@@ ate a high sensitivity of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film and domin@@ ance of the color green ( Chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white and snow !
since the filter colour channels are used to produce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs since the color is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ fil@@ ming effect on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original photo is under ( 1 ) and the be@@ et picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of A@@ ura in the top .
the digi@@ tization is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce films on your images . this is well known from classical high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of large silver pat@@ rons of the photo emul@@ sion .
your photo shows a certain mood or seem to be back in the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road phot@@ ographic , gra@@ iny , especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated by the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of Kör@@ ner . the default value is higher , even higher values are needed to be set on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more body , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the fil@@ mic effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the be@@ ating ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity equal to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a cross @-@ legal algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil painting gives your digital images showing a nice appearance like a oil painting . natural pictures and styles are well suited for this effect .
there are two buttons to influence this effect . the top is the pin@@ out size between one and five out of . thi@@ ere brush paints better for big images . smooth , or , from the other side from the side of the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is characterized by the ( 1 ) and the be@@ ating is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel large picture is 1 and pu@@ ff 17 .
the addition of the digi@@ tization : filter coal drawing is used to create a coal outlet . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dients are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine that scene you would have chosen to ski@@ p yourself . this would be good pictures to begin .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control these effect . the upper kno@@ cking out the pin size from and the lower adjust the contrast ( gent@@ leman ) .
this is an example of the coal tank filter . the original image ( 1 ) and modified image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity level .
the digi@@ tization : filter engraving defines your image in 3 @-@ D , when it was marked in wax . it uses a legally binding algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous , filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important content . the filter used the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a grey , mon@@ ochro@@ me landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the be@@ ware picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can use a normal photo in a work of art by using the di@@ stortion effects . it uses this to be protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analo@@ g@@ ous to the wavelength 1 , the picture here comes with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can use a normal photo in a artwork by un@@ shar@@ p @-@ effects . it is used to be protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ s the picture along stern@@ al lines from a centre run . this simul@@ ates the tough@@ est camera and generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ s the picture by turning of the pixel to a center . this simul@@ ates the tough@@ ness of a camera .
distances : s@@ wis@@ s the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused cam@@ er@@ in@@ se . the object seems to come back in the background .
movement un@@ tigh@@ ter : knowing the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the tough@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train ride , camera .
soft bra@@ ins : s@@ wis@@ s the image is soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream and shiny focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or add a warm and sub@@ ti@@ ls .
cont@@ act@@ less sharp@@ ness : s@@ wis@@ s the image by random com@@ posi@@ tional pixels , thereby simul@@ ates the tough@@ ness of a non @-@ moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour &apos;s pool in the picture and s@@ wis@@ s these without the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . as a result , it gives a natural picture of your pictures . it is used by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ ged protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the image . since the trop@@ hy is not automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect on the picture .
you can stick to the digi@@ tization ; image processing is free of shelf @-@ free . use the range tool to choose for example a face , that is free to choose . if you restart the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free from Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelf fil@@ esystem . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the be@@ ware picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset on a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo is the wrong orientation , you can bring it by spi@@ es or rotation into the correct orientation . the tools can be trans@@ forming and trans@@ forming them to the menu .
photo blocks definitely one of the most widely developed tools in order to get a photo to enlarge at a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is simple , as you can see a picture of a picture and the details of the resolution ? how can you be used in a picture , you can find out more information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here , makes a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
if a picture is the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ forming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialogue is below .
the tool used for size is a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to match the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to f@@ bl@@ ender .
many education programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , i.e. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . the underlying algorithm used by the IMA@@ GE Team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to say the tool like you want the size of the size . these settings are available in the Reiter New size :
aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the input of the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies larger structures . this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbine effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons can be saved as and store exactly . each st@@ all@@ age for photo , can be stored as a text file and later will be loaded later .
photo sli@@ ce is very fast in what it makes , but it can still take a long time , and a high CPU load will go after . you can break the calculation at any time with the button .
below , you can see below for photography by a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard counter .
the feed of one photo is not only a common operation , but also a picture of a picture , you need to move the right to mouse , using the mouse button , pressing the mouse button , and create a rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this right , while you move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , you will cut off the area . thereby , you can change the size of the turning area , by turning the size of the rect@@ angle , by making a new rect@@ angle using it simply with the left mouse button .
once you are pleased with you , use the button The Zu@@ cutting de button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut down ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file again and file sharing in the menu file to save the new picture .
in the pre@@ amp area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by setting the corners with mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialogue , stays in the dialogue .
in the mould with aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format area . in the high format , the larger value of height and cross @-@ format width is assigned .
the tool is used to reduce the aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the di@@ alo@@ gy , two buttons provide automatically horizont@@ ally horizont@@ ally and vertical .
below for the dialog , you can set the area with the Max . ratio button to access to the largest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool with the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation of orientation . the default image can be stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data can be re@@ discovered in the EX@@ IF tables , and not the original image .
the settings of mer@@ ging aid will enable them to make your images better and put your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmoni@@ ous particip@@ ations are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ par@@ agus , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are the possibility to share a similar to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus mus@@ sels , or the bub@@ ble on a sunflower . it is mentioned in all possible things to find as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the old Egyptians and the pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have been used in all times when you use your pictures , buildings and even photos put together to give your creations for a natural order and beauty .
the number is directed by the Fi@@ bon@@ acci result 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . one composition the composition is considered as a visual harmon@@ ically .
the golden center provides liquid aid lines , if you are able to set up a picture . this help are shown below :
the golden spiral allows you to get your destination for your photos . in comparison to the third par@@ agus , the golden spiral can follow the eye . this kind of composition carries out the viewer &apos;s viewing along the line of Spir@@ ale and abol@@ ished in this kind a symmet@@ ric visual River .
another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral , too . it should be something that the eye can be turned into the centre of composition . this can be a line of or different objects . this is just because the eye can be tra@@ ded without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the golden tri@@ angles are also available from the top . its failure rates are the middle of the sides of the golden tri@@ angles , a golden tri@@ angles of the same tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be used in diag@@ onal .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to set up your frame . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ section and other visual information into the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition which you can &apos;t reach it otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al @-@ mirror and vertical scale can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
with the button color , you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . to this type , you can adjust the colour of the lines of your current image .
the free web press is a tool to turn a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to get off the camera to get a angle . you can use this with the digi@@ tization ; image editing and the tool free press . select trans@@ forming free press and adjust the target angles .
rot@@ ate your image with the shooting angles . you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right hand side of the box . the new dimensions of the image can be displayed right above .
to your help , the module is free of a horizontal line and vertical line . move the mouse to appear on an important point of image , you can fixed him with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in the previous section .
after you have a picture , you will find tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair the function trans@@ forming part of the image processing .
an elegant way to cutting the picture is cutting edge . select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing gl@@ ass@@ é the picture is a bit after the rotation . please note the above warning .
all Peru@@ vian trans@@ formations are carried out around a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image , and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically re @-@ calculated automatically on the right @-@ hand side of the di@@ alo@@ gy . you will find some information which you can help you :
new lati@@ tude : the width of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation are made in pixel .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation are made in pixel .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ forming area .
angle right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ forming area .
according to the adjustment of the perspective , the image becomes somewhat less . for an individual adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve got the perspective , you get a good tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a possibility of view is to be connected to the image with trans@@ forming part of the image processing .
this module is used to move towards a part of the image in one direction and the lower part to the left . this is no thresh@@ ing , the image will be confused . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can start this module over trans@@ forming .
sk@@ ate your picture by adding the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you can set the angle to zero , the angle to zero is displayed . a preview of the effect will be displayed and displayed the new dimensions of the target file &apos;s right .
to your help you get a vertical and horizontal line . move the mouse to one important point , e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fixed the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the image , the image will have a bit s@@ wis@@ s . for a single lubri@@ cation , this effect is typically neg@@ li@@ gible , but two cou@@ ches have twice as much as devast@@ ation and therefore , you should avoid this .
after lubri@@ cation , the image has an unusual tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate it , it is the image with trans@@ forming cut into the image processing .
there are a number of libraries and other packages available to read image formats . therefore , the types depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type , such as these libraries were comp@@ elled . in most distribution , you can see a large number of screens with &amp; contents .
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give you a list of all available file formats . they always will always be JPEG and T@@ IFF among them .
there are only files in formats to know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this list . if the extension is shown in image processing , you can change these list of file extensions . you may change these list of file extensions . in the section , you will find further information about this page .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to choose to choose format . a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedure for digital image . thereby redund@@ ant information are reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss @-@ free when this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read in English on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge . you can convert raw images to JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw material Converter . in the section , you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; supported the game of rough pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which are supported in &amp; digi@@ ous . all cameras can be seen below the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from &amp; contents .
many digital cameras support the recording short films . however , these clips are often used in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but if you have no built @-@ in films . if you want to display any film file , download &amp; digi@@ tization ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to playback films are used to start playing the program .
going forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go ahead if you have gone before .

the same applies to all met@@ adata between the database and all files , that &apos;s not only in the current view as with this menu . the met@@ adata database is written by the data of the files . the other variant can be launched from the menu .
all configur@@ able cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to add a new camera . please check out in the section of the camera .
K@@ IP@@ I module is exported a series of pictures in a K@@ ML @-@ structure . K@@ ML @-@ files can be opened with Google Earth and displayed .
if you change the steps 4 and 5 well , what you can make good when the initi@@ als already was very well , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module .
many tools which need the photo editing , are included ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , sof@@ ter , pins , re@@ focus , re@@ focus , meaning the effect is used in a preview before the filter will be used on the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture Ac@@ commod@@ ation ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress beams shows the status of the filter on the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons provide the comparison to comparison of pre@@ dic@@ tive area . these modes are :
vertical share without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter is applied to the right of the selected Vor@@ um area .
horizont@@ ally , horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper area shows the original and the lower filter is applied to the area below the selected area of the area .
vertical . the left area shows the original and rights to the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally , the upper area shows the original and the lower distance to the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse about &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the pre@@ amp area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch in order to show over@@ - and under@@ lines . the used colours can be adapted in the general installation page .
you can go on a preview of The preview site . you can take this preview of the mouse within the image and look at the part of the image , you can see the preview of the image , you can instantly updated the preview of the Di@@ alo@@ gs .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility of all buttons on your standard values . all adjustment from the last use of the module are noticed .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image , and is largely explained in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are available from the EX@@ IF data , if they are available .
this Reiter provides an intuitive card tool based on the Mar@@ ble pot . press C@@ tr@@ l ; pressing the mouse button to be fil@@ tered by a square . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . this sets out of course the images of Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ olo@@ re@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for viewing of colour pal@@ ettes and to choose and benefit of colours .
the pall@@ ets files , which are installed by &amp; K@@ DE , can be installed either for the whole system or just a user . in the latter case they are used in your personal file for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and in@@ feed .
in the dialog , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , select the files to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line view . it can be moved to the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to the color . the colour is described under the pal@@ aces view . here you can also be changed to the color name .
it can also be used to choose to choose . to make such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to move . afterwards , the mouse can move to the mouse in the mouse button .
if the check@@ box is activated in the button on the button color , the colour is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ taken . this mode can choose to choose by using the check@@ box under B@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection of which created this creates as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and inser@@ ts .

graph@@ s &amp; graphic programs are available in science , especially in the science , especially in computer science . so far there are no modern &amp; GUI programs ; it includes programs that out@@ dated &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , according to view of the program author , &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replace these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a good integrated &amp; K@@ DE program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programmes . and programs are free layout programmes . with all possibilities of a good integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; programme in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph@@ er in &amp; Kate ; the Graph@@ ite will be re@@ charged and in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; represents )
menu to open the Graph@@ s &amp; Kate ; open to the Graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in one &amp; Kate ; component to open
load of great Graph@@ s ( currently there are problems about 1000 kn@@ ots and one H@@ ack , to be more than that kn@@ ots )
other necessary software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; programme which uses the &amp; graphic design ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph@@ s are required .
at the beginning , if you start and open , the main window is open alone . at the beginning , if you open &amp; k@@ graph ; without an argument , the tool opens up only the symbol file . in this case , the tool opened the symbol no . click on the first icon to open the dialogue file .
after you have a or more &amp; dot ; files have chosen , the main window is like in the lower @-@ screen photo :
as you can see , a overview in the corner is displayed when the Gra@@ ph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a solid position in this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse cable ( high and r@@ under without special keys , left and right at the left &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions through a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graphite .
if the just in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; charged file from another program , the following window is shown here :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be re@@ charged , whether you want the change to ignore it . if you want to change your decision , you can change your decision later , you can set the menu item key@@ graph ; set up , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ ite like an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic software ; instance , &amp; eg ; basically the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic software ; instance you want to open up or the lad@@ ders in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice , but also with the setup dialog .
with the program start , you can open all Graph@@ s your last session again . again , you can change your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the Gra@@ ph can be split into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the Graph@@ ite will be ignored , on this page , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you set the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the Graph@@ ite .
side @-@ side with one on several pages , Graph@@ s without a he@@ ader and with a different font
the site provides the possibility to specify the behavior if a file is changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can choose a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or changes to ignore ) or the program every time .
there is the possibility to open the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; if a gra@@ ph is open from a current session . you can open a standard behavior in a new window or at a window of the current session ) or determine that every time the time is required .
the site &apos;s request is the possibility to open the start of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session , or not ) or determine if you want to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which is normally open at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; other options are opened :
here you can select under various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorith@@ ms . entries , as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; they are described ,
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for fo@@ als . it produces hierarch@@ ical or skilled represent@@ ations of the graph@@ s . the algorithm used to become the same direction ( from top to bottom or left to right ) and try to produce a short canal and as possible to produce a few edges .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ ster graphite . he produces represent@@ ations of the Spr@@ ung@@ fe@@ eder model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm used to be syn@@ onymous with statistical sc@@ aling display .

the main window of the symbol Ed@@ itors is divided into five areas : the main tool , the most beautiful for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour range and the slide network , in which you draw the symbol .
a new icon . if the current file is changed , you will be asked if you want to store the changes . afterwards , you can choose whether the symbol of a model will be created , or if you want to start from the ground up .
again , this function is repeated again . if you don &apos;t have a step back , this function is de@@ activated .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new picture ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey levels . this can create colours that do not match the symbol range of &amp; K@@ DE .
changed the icon , but sets the current drawing colour on the color of point , click on .
the status bar shows you the current actions at the left . from left to right shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the En@@ tran@@ ce factor and the current number of colours of the symbol .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new picture ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open the settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialogue with the three sides of symbols , background and symbols .
with the buttons , add ... , editing ... and removing you can change the templ@@ ates for standard File , Source File , Com@@ posed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixel , put it into color : or a chess board as transparent display . you can also choose the size : the kar@@ os on Klein , medium and Great , and the colour 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module includes pictures to read tools in order to read new pictures .
this module can be used to treat new images included in external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images sc@@ anned : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images of a scanner of the S@@ ane project or another source , such as video streams . this means that you will need K@@ oo@@ ka and S@@ ane installed .
if you want to choose the menu entry , you will open a dialogue between all available sources on your computer . select the source of you want to get the image from all available sources . you can also choose the default source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window will be able to replace your own image . see the preview site and adjust the area your needs . read the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
pay attention that the window is completely displayed , as some settings are not displayed .
after you have pressed the button on your scanning , you have to specify the compression and type of image file . do you think that type BMP is not compressed , and thus produces very large files . you also need to select the file &amp; # 160 , or edit the image can be stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen &quot; menu Imp@@ act &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen photo ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which you can choose to set different screens phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop in order to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program is selected , you will disappear to watch other screens and window . otherwise you will see , after a short delay , the currently visible workplace . if you choose the whole work area you will only read the window under the mouse .
the delay is determined as long @-@ screen photo , before it starts . if you need to select this delay high enough to choose from time to navigate there .
after the screen photo was produced , the dialog elements of the destination options are described above the options described above .

before HTML @-@ pages you have to create some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each section is available .
first , give the titles of the over@@ clock and a description , which should contain HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML Ex@@ ample pages , you can see an example of this settings .
next , you choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files will be found in .
last , you can select that information can be displayed on the HTML pages . so you can consider that the pictures from a party are obvious , so all the pictures of the same images are exported . therefore , you can not use this setting , so that the images can not apply to certain pictures before a certain way .
in this field you can look back , like the HTML pages are supposed to look like HTML pages . most of them are clearly visible , which is not specially established in this case .
below the side you can choose various resolutions for the pictures . thus , those have to look at the site and monitor a monitor which have the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , which have no images for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
on your site , the viewer can change at any time , it can change your images with low resolution , as well as to a lower transmission time , as well . if he would like to get a picture larger , he would like to get to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you put the various folders and the URL will be stored where your website is stored .
at the best , you select a basic file for your HTML files and a new sub@@ file for each succ@@ essive sentence .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be stored . this folders will be stored in the next time . by this , you can select either a file or one of K@@ DE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures if you have created a URL . if you have created a URL , the URL is started . the URL , which you should be fixed here , should be this file . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file .
in the final destination , you don &apos;t have to copy it manually in the final destination . this means that the import function , see , right , you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ file of the files , but the basic file will be found in the sub@@ ord@@ ner .
the only described features can be found all three on basic file and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ ord@@ ner is laid out , whose name is set in output file .
if you come to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , you can get to create a HTML site . however , you can add your pictures on the images , place , etc . , then you have to make sure you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; this work will not even be able to do .

there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in -@@ files , internal and external . it can be stored in the file , or if you are able to store them in the file , that you can set all pictures together , and this file is so ir@@ respective of this file . however , the obvious result is the file size .
you can either create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file , together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ k@@ im file .
if you are looking for an external .@@ k@@ im file , the pictures are not found in the file . at first , the pictures of the URL will search for HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML exports .
in the following , dialogue is described by the dialogue , which you can find via the menu file ... Find out more .
the most important option of this di@@ alo@@ gues is to act as it should be in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options available :
if an option is done in the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same file as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the proximity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; the pictures are automatically for you .
normal Zi@@ p files are normal Zi@@ p files . as most pictures already were compressed , and the XML file is very small , it is normally not enough to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to use this , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this site is Maxim@@ ale image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very big . here you can say the size of the size , for example , that each picture can be up at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the enco@@ ded .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file , select &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , which are exported to the database as described in .
the assistant to imp@@ or@@ atory is made up of four steps . first you need to select what images you want to import , then , in which file the import pictures should be copied .
it may be that you can use the category persons of your application file ( if you are a Danish e ) , while this category is required for your database . that &apos;s why in the third di@@ alog@@ window , the categories should be imported to import , and which are to be used in your database .
in the fourth step you can use the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this you see on the picture .
it must be easy to look at and view : if you see images , you want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday . if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday , you would like to discover all images that this friend is depicted .

the modules can be called on the modules and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , but are not sold separately . however , most modules have any help you can call on the modules themselves .
as the modules in multiple applications can be used together with the demo database , so you can test it on your own images . so , you should check out the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or more about the menu . do not say , I don &apos;t believe it !
the applications which use the modules more than K@@ IP@@ I common , are very different , making it a few modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when you &apos;re using various applications .
the greatest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply plug@@ ging in @-@ out albums ; this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ated it for some modules the order to albums out , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums .
thereby simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , there is still a list of albums were handed over . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser needs the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category you have set up in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you &apos;re using the category persons , if you have selected persons , so if you have chosen persons for the view and the module do this .
since there are some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not compatible , you can remove these from the modules from the modules . start the settings dialog , and select the modules in the modules , which modules are loaded .
on the picture you see an example for a starting screen , as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , start with your own pictures .
as you can see it from any other K@@ DE application , you can find quite a lot of information , as you can &apos;t have any information about your images . in the section we will come back to this window , but then just click here to watch the images that shows you an overview of all the pictures .
one of the most important functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , is the possibility to see each picture with notes . so , you can find any image either individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , and all images included in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browser like you can read in the section . if you want to see this comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can look three lists with a text box by giving people , places and key@@ words . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; since you can always use it back , if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the list below : if you have a family celebrations and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be printed , so you can find that the names used for above , the people can be moved faster and arrange .
if you prefer a alpha@@ be@@ tical list , click on the symbol for sor@@ row to your list under the list .
if you have a remarks on each picture , you might need to view all the selected pictures and pictures with notes . click in this case easily and back @-@ buttons , which are on the right side of the picture .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark these pictures , and the menu item multi @-@ level entries can be equipped with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , and California lie all in the USA . they are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as an overview . to indicate that there is a special symbol appears to show a special symbol .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment menu made it possible to add a entry into an existing or new monitoring category . in addition , you can also make an entry for this category to make this entry into a sub @-@ category . attention , this sets out that you just use your categories in alpha@@ be@@ tical menu .
you can postp@@ one of the individual elements of the note di@@ alo@@ gs by putting the bodies that form the upper side of the frame , and shift it . you can make a window into a window by putting him outside the window area .
if you are looking to meet the look at your needs with the settings , click on the button options , click the button options ... , which offers you the possibility of store the current structure and the appearance of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
you can also see a frame in this window . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and here are a window . this process you see in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you &apos;ll get an overview of the pictures of the pictures . for example , you can view the size of the pre@@ dic@@ tive pictures , by simply down the mouse but@@ t the mouse with the middle mouse button , con@@ figure it easy .
if you have a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop space .
if you click once to click on a picture , this will be shown in the images . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an educational level , a new display will be created .
you can see images in the image show images . select the corresponding pictures of you want , and press either the removing button or choose to edit menu item . now you will see the window , which you can see in the picture .
for this problem , you can also be stored on the hard disk . of course , you can record the pictures anywhere you have to take on the hard disk album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; if not all the necessary images can be loaded by the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the pictures are available , so you can see the preview of these images . however , you can also view these images with the picture viewing .
as you see , this function takes you to copy files from the files and copy it . if you want , even if you want to avoid each other to your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images to save all images .
in the menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want a little more privacy you want to be able to watch other un@@ accessible menu . alternatively , you can also see all the images showing your little sister , check out and select the menu entry for more than current view .
thus , you will be set to make the pictures in case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so all images that you have locked up , will be locked out . if you want to display the pictures , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password in a password , to be added to the un@@ locking of the images . to set this password , simply select a password in the menu of privacy .
please remember that this picture is not really safe . for example , you can read all pictures on the hard disk and delete the password . this kind of password protection is used to read the password , which are not familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; not very familiar to the ga@@ ze of private pictures .
the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , just over hours a day , you want to look at some time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , you can look back over a photo _ and video editing . these can be found out of the preview , as described in .
the viewer can be seen in the same picture , but also shows the picture , but additional information you can read about the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to view the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture , you can con@@ figure the information displayed and if any information displayed on the viewer . all these options are available according to a right click on the viewer . then the context menu menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , your browser will show you all the pictures from Anne Hel@@ ene . if you have selected persons from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can easily switch between them and back , by using the buttons picture of high and image below . you can jump on the first and final image with tro@@ l and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if several pictures can run in the viewer . and then you can get a new picture after a few seconds . as often a new picture invites you to press the strings button and Plus or Min@@ us . the Di@@ ash@@ au is started by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s amount of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer can use the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input key to change in full screen mode .
for example , if you use the viewer , you can go into the picture . with the mouse button , you can re@@ read the Plus button b@@ zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a Zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the Zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can put your zoom onto the image , so that the picture is not drawn with the Zo@@ oms , so that every pixels is equivalent to a pixel @-@ pixel image of the image .
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ ew must work with videos so that in and out of zo@@ oming with Plus@@ and Minu@@ st@@ aste .
the text menu made from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at the picture , you can see a picture with a person whose name you can &apos;t look back on the image . at the moment you can see the image and configuration options of the image , you may get to mark this name . however , it might be possible to mark the picture on mark and look more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see what photos you can start the viewer with the images and get it as good or bad , while you may see one after the other .
for the two examples of above , you see the opportunity to watch pictures with mercury , while you can view it . characteristics include the letter A to Z and you can make a feature that you are the corresponding letter . you can see a picture , in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have stored on your images , you can print your images , or whatever you &apos;ve been selected , so you can easily use all the pictures with notes . then you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD , or whatever you want .
categories and especially characteristics can be displayed in the pre @-@ view view . if you can add information on the pictures , by simply click the letters to the feature , after the image was selected . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allows you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not stored in the picture , but in the database . on the way you can look back your m@@ old later .
you can see a picture on the canvas . in order to end the colour mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums , check out in the picture paint on the text menu . in order to finish the cross , simply take the cross in the tool bar at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have to fully understand the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you need to read and understood .
in object tree , you can choose individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in object properties and the object in the wire model - views yellow .
you can also select several objects simultaneously in the same time . but not the object of an estimated property , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new object in object wood , select the position when you want to add the object and click either the symbol in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are several possible positions , the following folding @-@ menu will be in@@ ends , so you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , to edit or off the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on application to take this changes . if you have any indication , you will select a message with an error description . then you can download the input and click on application or play the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the object shown exhibit with the help .
you need &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the documentation documentation .
if you work an texture or a section of an texture , you can view a preview of the Details Pan@@ e .
press on a preview of the rules view and a small example of the scene is en@@ dert , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element . if you only have a part of texture to texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button , thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , disappear the control points and it &apos;s a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation . you can change the deportation by gyp@@ sy with the mouse within the entire fish .
each object has as a wire model , as a single @-@ class level . you can only indicate this value or as an absolute value . objects will only appear , if they are selected , or less of the si@@ bility level , or equal to the tool &apos;s tool .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as a default setting . the object tree and the view of object properties are indicated to the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like to order the standard window order or if you need another arrangement , you can choose to set them any time . you can also save several windows of the orders and simply change between different regulation .
to bring a window over or under one present view , head to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange several views on each other , take the sum@@ m@@ aries in the middle of another view . you can then change between views of the views on the cart@@ ons in the views .
the last possible window arrangement are sulph@@ ur beli@@ efs , views not to solve the main window . to solve this view , take the sum@@ m@@ aries on the desktop or click on the left uphill to the left @-@ hand arrow in the façade system .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the dock . to prevent this , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu , you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are sh@@ ear@@ end , you can find them at any time .
the current window view can store you with view window order ... store . it &apos;s a dialog indicated in which you can save the window arrangement under a existing or new name .
if you have a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ ders , this program must be installed correctly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ ches the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry for scene .
a R@@ ender mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it is intended for images and quality of the ren@@ ders . if you want to add a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can get any number of R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview of full pictures in the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The section at the tool click or in the menu item R@@ ender modes ... choose , the following dialogue is open :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can choose any names , makes sense , but is a name that allows the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size , you can carry the width and height of the image . if you wish to render a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ field sub@@ section and enter the section to the ren@@ ces into the input areas .
in a combination field quality , you can choose the characteristics that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray are used . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection illumination . an exhaus@@ tive description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the us@@ erh@@ and@@ buch &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
if a picture with only a beam is en@@ cir@@ cled , various errors arise . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , sometimes details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixels . the effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these mistakes . in general , pictures with this feature better .
using anti @-@ ali@@ asing and switch &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel , this technology is super @-@ sampling .
supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sively , because every Pixel is still further split , and adapted to the records of the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , tra@@ ms POV @-@ Ray can be determined using super @-@ sampling rates . if you choose the depth of a specific number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calcul@@ ates the depth of a specific number of pixel , an extra @-@ volume of 4x4 points will be charged with a depth of 5 by 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays each pixels .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first Pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixels . if the difference between the color values are specified , the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed separately on further under@@ lines . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth .
another chance to reduce the ali@@ asing effect , is the creation of smokers for the Stra@@ hl &apos;s process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off at J@@ itter@@ ing , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray sets the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the last setup for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is a experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ reflection is calculated . it takes a long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this box map , you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is transparent , if the associated beams are not made .
a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ con@@ sol@@ ation Edition . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file imports ... and choose from the di@@ alog@@ istics one file .
currently &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er is currently supported and not the complete command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; however , if the imp@@ acting error messages or war@@ nings will demonstrate a dialogue window of all the messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
objects from object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; an editor . to import objects into the scene . in order to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in editor and drag him in the object tree .
with Kop@@ ats and Simp@@ ly in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene is broken . usually this PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on the help in the Details view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the selected object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search@@ es for external files ( for example : al@@ fel@@ dd@@ aten ) in the pins of the scene you must also bear the path to these files . if a file is found in different thread of the library , the first spot@@ ted file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used to display the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visible field in the camera view and into the window @-@ type label .
you can adjust the object of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wireless model . you can set up the R@@ aster separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turning .
larger values have a more accurate image model and thus better nails for the required objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects , such as ball can be set up the detail stage for two directions .
when you &apos;re talking to a detailed projections for advanced projections , all wireless projections are used . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections . this feature is a better approach for projections , requires more time to ren@@ ders .
if you bet a wall , a wall behind the objects . the wall is depicted in a chess box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you ignore ground , a floor is below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you decide to dis@@ solve the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ ders of the scenes , you can adjust the values for depth and swelling . you can find more accurate data to the parameters you find in the R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can create existing window orders or new window orders . in the section window orders will create , how you can create windows and store .
the combination of the standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order for the program .
the list of the window system shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add the button to add and create a select arrangement with the button removing .
each window order is identified by the name ; the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can add to the button to add and selected views with the button removing .
the position of the new F@@ enst@@ ers . with a new column , you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with a cart@@ on card with the previous view and set the view , the view is not on the main window , but this creates a separate window .
so you &apos;ve just started &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and if you follow all steps in this guide , you should follow the ultimate but simple scene you may very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain that you will only receive a black screen . if you are using a 3D program , you should consider this important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for ren@@ ders can be applied as a result , you will receive a black picture .
if you add any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ lessly installed , you see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
they take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation , so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you &apos;ll need to use these menus and symbols , so should you use the menus and symbols and use their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you &apos;ll need to remove all objects from object tree . mark the scene and select the menu entry , you &apos;ll have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks like the camera . in particular note the scene of the camera &apos;s fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the camera . this is the result of the Ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object tree contains a new record with the name camera . if you click on , see the content of the camera &apos;s view , to which the different parameters can be found . in the user documentation , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is the following lines , but also notice that the camera can change the camera to change the camera . click easily with the left mouse button to a control point and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button application or modify the input button , the wireless model and object sizes are immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the bottom for the scene . you could add a qu@@ ake ( introduc@@ tory body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a smooth method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; indeed , actually an easy way to use . you can also use a infinite plain as bottom :
a good advice : select the plain in object tree , change the name , and press the button application or pressing the button . in object tree the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model shows now the level also shows the level , if also at the moment only as limited level . if you ren@@ ched the scene , the level rises to the horizon .
if you click the object of object right , you &apos;ll find the number of object for the floor as you click on the icon + . in this case you can find the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , thresh@@ ing and delay . select one of these options , also modify the possible settings in the view of object properties .
in this scene you should change the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just trying to get some of these parameters , select the delay and put the values as follows :
choose from the ground to set his material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little bit of materials .
in both cases , a dialogue may choose which you can choose from object &apos;s object . please select the name in the object &apos;s object ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ment contains only a matt black material , because you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on you . now give you the colors for the pig@@ ment . but instead there are many possibilities , but take the easi@@ est way .
if you do not see a color on qu@@ ader and ball , click here to the button application and call the preview site .
the material for the floor is now correct . if you like your image now with a click on the symbol ren@@ ders , you should get the following result :
of course there are not the colors necessary . in the color list , you &apos;ll need to use two new attributes . in the color list , you can also use this entry twice ( you can also do this , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colours ) :
in the object of baum , select the colors in the view of object properties :
this step should be run simply run as you can simply run the fundamental work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; even if the ball may be just as easy as the bottom :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for your radius : 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input or button application ) , so that the ball would break off the ground , as you would have moved to the ground by a unit .
of course , Ren@@ ders are now a strange result : as previously mentioned before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . set in the following step , a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now have a material . as soon as at bottom , you enter the ball of pig@@ ment as a color :
if you choose the ability and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click the pig@@ ment , then select the color and make the values like follows :
but you can gain more interesting effects , if you take the time , some fin@@ ish features :
change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input button .
the settings are Glanz effect and reflection in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal is not selected :
you should now have a good impression of it , what the opportunities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully you have already learned how much , which you can create simple , but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a Pinot method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you have a scene , hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , reflects the scenes ) of any pixels in the scene , and the visual effects of light sources in the scene , like atmospheric effects , such as ne@@ b@@ ula . thus , the scene pixels for pixels was processed .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see without any camera , you &apos;ll see the camera . without a light source you can &apos;t see the picture , it &apos;s simple black . obviously , any scene you need to be rounded , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY file usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file , which you have previously prepared with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er .
whenever you open a new model , it will add the file into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model already , it will be stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and a storage place .
shows the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been subjected since the last store .
this menu entry can only be select , if you don &apos;t read the changes in the scene .
repeated the last und@@ able command . this menu entry can only be select , if you have not able to re @-@ end .
stores of the current window order and opens a dialogue , in which you can write a name for a new arrangement or a existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for the setup of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key@@ boards and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the key@@ presses . you can change the pre @-@ launched short order for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands or add new .
opens a dialogue to the installation of the tool bar . you can add with this option symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands and remove .
a dump map is a possibility to be screw@@ ed on surface surfaces , without any Beu@@ le on the surface to be model@@ ed and without the geomet@@ rical shape of the lens itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms which are used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . this models will be processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object colour based on pixel basis , by using a photo file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewing and browser browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose photos to display .
images can either be displayed in a window in the size of the image or full screen .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser is enco@@ ded with click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or button Return .

you may need to install existing multimedia buttons so that they work as a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly describe in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and other words describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ COP function break &amp; z@@ b ; so look like :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ site options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still supports some of the command @-@ site options .
you should give a feedback if the script because of a lack of depen@@ dency may not be executed . please check in your script if all required modules are available , and use the dialog to reference why a script is not running .

in the file Scri@@ pts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of presentation scrip@@ ting in many different languages . you can easily expand your own script or simply by the required functions . you will find fast that the writing by scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easi@@ est way is to use the use of d@@ code d@@ co@@ p ; which should be installed in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the output of external programs and commands . usually , the function Ex@@ ec ( ) uses this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to use . here , an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends you to the default value of the script . for this reason , script should monitor their standard settings , and are related to events . of course , a script the events can ignore it if there is no use .
con@@ figure We@@ ist the script to indicate the setup dialogue . to store your data and store the setup data . if a script will be started , Amar@@ ok will be stored on the folders where all data is stored .
tra@@ ck@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is used . the script could now be used &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions for more information about the new piece ( for example , the met@@ adata or the piece @-@ length ) .
volume change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is a value value between 0 and 100 .
custom menu for the selected files can be used . to add a menu entry , the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ scrip@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) can be used to remove a user @-@ defined entry required . to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Cu@@ stom@@ ca Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ti@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok , the user sends out a script stop , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal will be processed to the script . this signal should be processed to do for instance mo@@ ing up to do . for example , it belongs to the data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok Sk@@ ri@@ pt administration can also be compressed with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . so we can recognize the archive with b@@ zi@@ p@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that users can recognize the archive to the archive as en@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept a script packages with the extension of amar@@ ine script . from that reason , you should use your script packages at the same time .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the rest of the lad@@ ders modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script @-@ package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org you can download and use the link to the Wi@@ ki Sk@@ ri@@ ve site of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry to K@@ DE apps , you should use the category of Amar@@ ok ; Sk@@ ills .

includes all the opening projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored Project will be asked what should happen to be done as if you were called .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as if you want the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the new project appear to appear in the basic file of the CD .
this dialog is open to the &quot; Bren@@ nen &quot; for the current project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , for the burning of the media . the burning dialogue can only open when the project is already included .
the characteristics for the current project . here you can find many project @-@ related settings for the current project . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is what is ? -@@ help via the right mouse button .
this entry is only available for a multi @-@ professional CD / DVD or video DVD project . the data of the previous session is always available , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you to help you see the medium files and folders .
this entry is only available in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is set to remove the files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function is no files from the medium , they only ends the previously imported files .
you can also use the CD @-@ copy dialogue . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD to another medium . you can also get the possibility of cl@@ one instead of normal copy . you should prefer to copy it if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
you can also create a DVD copy of a DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also get the possibility of cl@@ one instead of a DVD copy , so that the target medium must be large enough to take the entire medium ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
this dialog opens the dialog to sol@@ ete a CD @-@ R@@ W . in order to er@@ ase the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
the dialog for the format of a DVD . with this dialogue , you can install a DVD ± R ( W ) format , which means that the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b makes you the choice between the write modes and incre@@ mental retard@@ ation .
burning CD @-@ copy . the dialogue ask for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file can be burned down instantly . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning DVD copy . the dialogue reads according to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burned down by pressing the burning @-@ button .
an earlier DVD @-@ video can be converted . this sli@@ der window is usually used as a DVD in the table view , but can also be used as well as possible . it contains information about the ann@@ es@@ ene video , co@@ si@@ ders and even options to change the size and cut black r@@ als .
this information shows information about the common medium . these information are shown in the table view and include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool bar from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small fraction is displayed at the bottom edge of the F@@ enst@@ ers . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status is hat@@ ched .
the file view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , the content view is displayed . CD / DVD drives also features an context menu with functions such as media information , sper@@ m and un@@ locking the drive or th@@ rows of media .
for this purpose , the contents of view is a view or from the files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with an appropriate CD / DVD in the file view .
for this purpose , the head bar in the project view or from . the head bar is a narrow area that contains only visible if the project view is open . the head bar has no real position , it looks like a pretty picture , and the project view is clear of the remaining views .
this opens a slide @-@ window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard order .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; an individual assistant . thus , system administrators need to be set to burning your CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrators have to enter the password for the system administrators ( root ) .
the settings can be made up of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . here , general program settings can be made up . almost all the functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alize and the enemy of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical , therefore , rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial , which will give you the pre @-@ confirmation programs .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make sure you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then you will give something like the following line :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; program mix@@ tures , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ aux ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cream D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cream D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cream D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cream D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid Re@@ f cream D@@ v@@ d ( ) v@@ oid bs@@ v@@ ate@@ x .
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project ( using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface ) .
k@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface as well as the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which is available only on data protection ( CD and DVD ) :
v@@ oid cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Quartet , Q@@ String Quartet ) v@@ oid remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Quartet , Q@@ string new@@ name ) v@@ oid set@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Quartet ) v@@ oid set@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Quartet )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script is a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ x $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ad@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ob@@ le ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ able for &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read and read in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on Encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ob@@ le ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) and by many co @-@ files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) standard by default ( These Ko@@ di@@ erer ) must be added from the Linux Distribution ( if they have been installed ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of &amp; CD ; read and read in WAV files on the computers ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually a per title ) compressed in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or any other formats like the los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , the check out of &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ an@@ oia . almost each distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ effici@@ encies are already available , but there is no longer necessary to comp@@ ile it . however , if F@@ LA@@ C must not be used , the installation is not necessary .
the co @-@ file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer has a small introduction via Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word to head of protected audio CD ; as it has been said , uses &amp; D data ; therefore it is not possible to use an protected audio CD ; if it is not possible to use any audio CD ; even in any case you can use the mechanisms of cop@@ i@@ protection . avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CDs .
while the setup fee has to be done only once ( the setup dialogue ) , the daily approach to read a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . this leads to understanding for the slender approach of the user interface , which you will start in the start often .
can convert many formats - depending on what Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information about the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can be fully covered without a network , whereby everything is included .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main f@@ enst@@ ers . on the site step , for example , more information , such as this program will be used as well as photos , photos of the programme for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the device of CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online ) , in the latter case the CD@@ DB must be produced on the Internet . )
starts the read and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the entries of Ko@@ di@@ fication settings in the setup fee - the co@@ op .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with any other en@@ coder as the standard Encoder . it is aware that the en@@ coder is configured in the settings dialog .
the file manager opens the file manager , so that an end of the file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialogue with the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for events events ( as out@@ read the &amp; CD ; ended ) .
opens the main building dialogue between &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ iler ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the enco@@ ders ) , you &apos;ll have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter illustrates sound quality , co@@ di@@ erer and compression rates and helps you with the right choice .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . apart from F@@ LA@@ C there are other such as &apos; sh@@ arks &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution and hardly available commercial devices to play these files .
according to audio formats , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG can now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but they are less important than that they are very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distribution as free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ audio systems . today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format .
a quick list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting press rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting takes good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium . some older devices need CBR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a titanium . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ o@@ tives . but not good enough for better stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most of the environments , but if you need to use the absolutely highest quality without back@@ view to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; Information , the manual is included or by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b program , are available as a list of parameter settings . you can be used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ a ; and the coordin@@ ating program to create files and file names as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co @-@ programmes , there are often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters . the manual or the help to the coordin@@ ators explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ( english : day ) to add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ be added ; the result looks like : &apos; -@@ t@@ t { prize } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ iler ; parameters that can be used ( = button code name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is available : a free database can be found in the people , so that all other information can be downloaded into the computers . it &apos;s note that you can only talk about text : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legally binding , but I &apos;m not a lawyer . however , there is no matter that you are on &amp; CD ; therefore , there is no more or less valuable , so it may not be added to the music of the music . all the information can be added in a b@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ ob@@ le ; if the use of fre@@ ed@@ b address can be used as the system used in this type . in this kind of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address can &apos;t be used by the server ( this can only know the programming code aware of the code . )
there are many countries to use the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ga is set to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally on the next flying mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and counter@@ s the load between the computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org delivers a current list of Refle@@ ctions for the online call of &amp; CD ; information about how to read a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually year monthly ) only the updates of the database .
the read@@ out program is used to save pieces out of the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ors that this c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia will be used ; if you want to know more , search in source code ... This was the best choice for the read of audio CDs . see the note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia package from the matching distribution must first be installed , if this is not done .
for storing your wav @-@ files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening are defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) on the Register@@ card . other com@@ ers can be added on this Register@@ card .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution , before Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined Ko@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ op you can get further information about its switch as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ete window ( eg ; console ) . however , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the installed chamber .
this may have a lot of causes . check the device of the device nam@@ ing of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . what could give a hint regarding what is false .
check if you do not check a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; and this is not gel@@ ingen !
there is an chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , tips can give you how to go .
have you read the complete manual , however , there are still un@@ certain what is ? well , there is no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to prepare those areas , which you want to make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and our first &amp; CD ; read l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ boards ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia and l@@ ame on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled pack@@ ets for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files you can always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd
the first section deals with basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ a ; something that is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for every single &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here , we determine the sound quality of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 - 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with that the fre@@ ed@@ b will be able to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will not be able to change it with each set of one &amp; CD ; change if once the matching settings are found .
the equipment designation will be given to the read@@ out program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device name . if you can &apos;t work with other programs , the drive can be given to the / etc / f@@ stab file , and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card of General Settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion is defined . in our example , everything will be shown in such as in screen photo .
only add un@@ full information if you ask , so that you are informed about the creation of key@@ boards ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply can select both entries . we are comfortable and let the disc . you can download and download the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computers .
note : the calcul@@ ator has to be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the internet , so he can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simple , if you are not satisfied with the database entry , or one day entries you can easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with con@@ scrip@@ tions - &gt; um@@ ben@@ ame and ID@@ 3 tags with Ki@@ d@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; meetings .
apart from this example is further notice : if you want to download it in offline mode , if you want to use everything in offline mode , if you need to use it twice . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields will be chosen , at least the first mode of mode is set up at the following card card .
CD@@ DB is intended for us fre@@ ed@@ b . this is the settings for us on the Internet . how do the system that will get the CD on the Internet . read the section via fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as it is shown in screen photo .
mode : we are not downloaded the database not only , we want to work with the web database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go on to Fri@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity . this way the load will be distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work is equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls allow the protocol 88@@ 80 standard by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data on the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check@@ box should be enough .
simply take the settings on screen photo . ( make sure that the folders / tmp on your computer exists )
number of simultaneous pieces in the same time : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at just one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and co @-@ code ? the author knows it , that &apos;s easy to try itself .
CD ; after align@@ ing the last piece , cross it to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined files for temporary files : if you can be saved , if you need to be stored on a different drive , the field is not included in a private folders . if you don &apos;t forget this file , if you want to make a bit with WAV files .
everything so type like it is on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances must be sh@@ aken anything to the right .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned earlier , this increase bit rate is sufficient for almost 224 - 256 k@@ p@@ bs . which reached the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restri@@ ction of the creation . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables on the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to enco@@ ded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be enco@@ ded at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic equipment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ via . this configuration is used as standard for each package of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music wise , you never need to change it again .
this section is described , as the process of read@@ out of the music is described , as we are comfortable and set up . first , you will find a link to the internet , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will be described above . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for each use and CD .
since we do not contain a &amp; CD ; it &apos;s not enough to be seen as a CD ; with successfully from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data on the Internet you can pick up from the internet . comments on the differences .
try to find out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done , so now the &amp; CD must be defined in the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , such as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CDs are identified and identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia .
if this is not done , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous settings regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD was collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all of the pieces are already carried out and also displayed the name of the artist &apos;s name and the album .
in the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; - key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window system , and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your &amp; CD &apos;s .
if you do not have selected the check@@ box by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings for the settings ) , you can use this manual by choice of the first buttons in the tool bar . if you do not have local database , but the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
E 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the Tit@@ els of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the denom@@ ination in the first row of the input field &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be given more in the input field &apos; current title &apos; , unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of di@@ a@@ sions per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is not empty . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Ed@@ itors , so you are not only satisfied with the artists and album names ( e.g. whether all words are beginning with large letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any adverse events .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 Tags for the artists , album and title of a piece of field . if you are using ID@@ 3@@ v2 ; a maximum of this option is set up ; this option is set up by default settings ; take a look in the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the files from the files into files anytime with the day Editor . Ki@@ d@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 Tags .
tags : they are not supported by all co@@ aters and file formats . see the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of out @-@ out CD ; it is not important as we are not able to register . for more information you go on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . Pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found among rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you get back to the main window . click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the data . simply enter the entries for the field of current product . just enter the product &apos;s title on any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way up to you all the title data of the &amp; CD .
please note : this window appears not , if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line . only the titles that are selected or out . make sure that all items are selected , or press the button on all items are connected to the lower edge of the screen to choose all pieces .
was launched through the cli@@ cks on the button . read the read@@ out process , so this window will be confirmation . on OK , then we will see a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
click on the ground orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper part of the F@@ enst@@ ers , directly under the kno@@ bs of the tool .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece will be read on the hard drive . the status of the program will appear in the left lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers in the status line .
this error message , if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer , you don &apos;t have to install it . plays the not successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the T@@ MP file and the target file is not what we have given here in an example . if you have a write access to the file for the temporary files and the target file ? ; - )
now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the code of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . in order to read and write . please note the status message in the lower part of the F@@ enst@@ ers , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have to supp@@ ress this behaviour , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the installed calcul@@ ator with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to read any problem with simultaneously read and en@@ code ( from however , two different pieces ) .
now , the last one has been read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order on the Wart@@ a , after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short period in the upper left part of the F@@ enst@@ ers .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ file ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ 00 or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ an@@ oia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ ob@@ le ; if you have already familiar with CV@@ S , it is part of an anonymous copy as part of an important &amp; K@@ DE package ; if you are part of an important &amp; K@@ DE package ; if you are using this package . if you read this package , you will probably have the package of your distribution . if you read this , you will probably have done it ...
this section is designed to comp@@ ile , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of your distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs , if it runs once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , and has a lot of variations on the settings . best read the step in step by using the options and settings . it shows screen printing photos of the different box cards and also includes comments for options which can not be used in the example .
hi , still on this ? even if only the help down menu of the program cli@@ cked , without any point of view , to go out of this somehow empty screen ( especially when the program starts with no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu made of ?
what about it ? who reads it , probably already started the program started . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t keep this manual for a manual and change or modify it . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has sent this section to this section . therefore , this proposal will agree with this proposal .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to pick you the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mide ; the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ es@@ pi@@ ers from &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , he has also with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ speed of texts , some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; and MIDI @-@ players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mide ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD will work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; it also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ projection screens , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is provided , as soon as there is a sequ@@ encing system .
&amp; k@@ mide ; shows the song text on the screen with changing colour , so it is simple to follow the piece .
graphical representation of activity each MIDI @-@ Kan@@ as due to high@@ lighting the buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
Dra@@ g &amp; Drop so that you can go into &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window onto the mid @-@ deck .
supports the two existing standard to store text in MIDI @-@ files ( real events or text events ) . K@@ Mid was automatically identified on the process .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the finish of a song starts K@@ Mid starts again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialogue with which help you select the desired song .
you can also see a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this works also with several songs simultaneously .
to play a music piece , open it and press the button to play in the tool bar , select the entry entry from the menu or use the Le@@ ert@@ aste .
please note that &amp; k@@ mide ; one piece is automatically starts as soon as you go on the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to one collection and then succ@@ essively off each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mide ; one piece , you can jump to any spot , by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ bs and drive .
if you find that a song gets to fast or slowly , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ mail . to get the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the Le@@ ert@@ aste has two tasks : if a piece is played on the button , a pressure on the button break , or select the menu entry required in the menu , sub@@ mitting the playback during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mide ; the reproduction .
song tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces are using texture event , others use lyrics events and again other both . some pieces have not even a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mide ; you can choose which events will be displayed and even better : the erection @-@ text file is automatically identified , automatically the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected . but you still have the opportunity to change this , if you want to see the other kind .
if you want to set an erection sty@@ p , select the menu settings the entries of the events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI @-@ files which you can put together . these will be played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections .
to set up a collection , open the collector manager . you &apos;ll find in the menu collection under the point of organ ... Click to New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection , by clicking on copying and then put the name for the new collection . this collection will contain at the beginning of the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the desired set in collecting manager .
in the temporary collection , all the songs that you want to add any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be stored . concerns the answer if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be chosen in collecting manager . there you can add a song one song with the button to add a song . you will select the file dialogue with which help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setup automatic adding to the collection .
if automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece added to open ( using file opening or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atically , add to the collection , if the collection is activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied to open . this collection will continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collector manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the order that will be played in the songs . if you select the series after the menu menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove , or random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in collecting manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump one song further , select the button next song , select the song next song or press the key arrow .
to jump back a song back , select the kno@@ cked out of the kno@@ b , or press the key arrow on the left .
to er@@ ase a collection , open the collector manager , select the check @-@ out collection and click on the button sol@@ ete .
the temporary collection can not be deleted , but it doesn &apos;t matter because they are not stored in the case of &amp; k@@ mide ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events will be able to understand the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the type change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et conver@@ ts and thus making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices , and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file of hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which saves all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which is often appear as required . pre@@ condition for this , however , each appearance is a different text ( see below ) .
DE@@ F@@ INE P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; The name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; A more key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Op@@ tions ... EN@@ D
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE will be used to indicate that one section begins ( except for Op@@ tions ) and EN@@ D that the end of an Section@@ it is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I use in future versions of &amp; k@@ mide ; support for devices that are not compatible with General @-@ MIDI inputs .
this section is specified in this section as the patch of General MIDI can be printed on your specific keyboard . as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ator is ignored . it is believed that the GM should not change in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all the sounds on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. sound 60 ) , which are similar to a fl@@ ashing . do not bear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file doesn &apos;t play a score with Patch 127 ( def@@ enses ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which , which is sound in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the &quot; drum patch patch &quot; ( drum , tank , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that allows the sound of the clay at the same drum ( such as some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify what sounds on a certain channel or instrument can be shown on a certain channel or instrument .
as at P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP -@@ Section is the order of the lines very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ boards for each channel and define several key@@ boards . you need to use several names in the first row .
key@@ boards are used primarily to cover sounds on the percussion instruments . check out the included key@@ boards .
this section can be used to form a few channels on other hand . if you want to s@@ wap the first and the second channel , you simply make the very simple in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have per@@ mitting on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP Section 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , constructed according to the following pattern :
if you use the key@@ map option , you will need key@@ map with the name name for this channel . if you want to use the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option , all events are ignored , to change the patch on this channel . in this case , you will always use Patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch Option can be useful for example , to use the percussion patch on the per@@ si@@ ders canal .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ ding ratio returns to the ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value , it will be calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then the value of 40@@ 96 is used , so in the map file doesn &apos;t get a dec@@ im@@ al@@ mas .
this setting is needed , because GM is going to play a sound with the value of 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are going to play on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mide ; try to try .
to use a MIDI map , you simply open the Di@@ MIDI settings . you can find in the menu item , point MIDI @-@ settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of Kla@@ vi@@ als ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . you can see what sounds just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal . for each channel there is a select list where you can select a instrument that can no longer use green but red , to indicate that no more will use the original instrument .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to indicate the mir@@ ers sounds . the view choose the menu item under the point channel view : settings
the pace LCD display shows the speed , with which one song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
if you want to change the pace of a song . if you find , a song is to be quick to follow the text , you can slow down the pace . to change the pace , take the arrows at the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played , the rhythm , speed , etc . , so the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes at very different ways .
good , I cannot fail to force &amp; k@@ mide ; but a typical MIDI file doesn &apos;t need a similar sound quality . if a MIDI file doesn &apos;t need a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you also have the control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mide ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download a source distribution and install a source distribution ( for example of k@@ mide ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree that &amp; k@@ mide ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . open the folders that you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
dis@@ able before setting the setting automatic return to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can use the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ d@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard bar , you can click on the LCD double click .
at a &amp; K@@ DE ; work area with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mide ; in this way , I want to play a kar@@ aoke file . if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and the desired file in the window of &amp; k@@ mide ;
if you want to add only one file to add a file , and add it to a collection , switch to the setting , switch to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to a temporary collection .
suppose you are using the MIDI @-@ files A.@@ mide , B.@@ mide and C.@@ mi@@ d . so , you only want to play the first file . so , you add the setup to the collection , and open A.@@ mi@@ d your temporary collection then just like this a MIDI file .
then do not include B.@@ mide and C.@@ mid to create and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have made me MIDI @-@ files or postcards sent . all many thanks ! if I see this songs or the postcard see , animated me to go on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
at the moment I &apos;ve been written by &amp; Antoni@@ us Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez , but I try to take a bit of time for my plan@@ ing , but I try to take me a bit of time . I can collect programming , MIDI @-@ files , music and sets .
if you want to download where they want to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mide ; or even if you want to make me happy , send me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ it
do you really want to send me a postcard from your home or an MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file , send me a postcard or a MIDI file . if you want to send a MIDI file , but should you take advantage of a MIDI file , but should I try out the file again .
I have written &amp; k@@ mide ; complete in my leisure and from anyone who doesn &apos;t know money . I want to emphasize that , because I don &apos;t want to take advantage of users because / if I get a feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always the window with the central view . and after all , there is a information windows that will only be displayed if information displayed in it .
it is possible to select the preferred connections under the menu mark the menu , but these are individual entries . if you &apos;re looking to create a list of entries to be played after each other , you should use the category of thum@@ b play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional problem . if you call an entry , his group , and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and the playback starts with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and thum@@ b player / k@@ m@@ player can also be changed through direct editing of the XML configuration file . it is possible to choose from the menu which menu choose to choose from the menu . by clicking on a sub@@ set , it will be displayed only the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , the menu must be chosen by the same with re @-@ play@@ list and select either check@@ box mode , or another category .
all changes go lost , when working mode , or another group will be selected without using the play@@ list .
as a result of the author &apos;s author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at the stack of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and change of &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted .

there is a riders on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path can be set up by the M@@ Player and the inter@@ storage memory size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting , is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there &apos;s no rider to be configured in the configuration options of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured with manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ through . here , such as a &quot; flash &apos; is played by the S@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can even be played by the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog of the K@@ DE .

&amp; k@@ m@@ player can be used by TV cards , either with M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . it can be configured to use the used device and the TV channels can be used . it can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
if the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings are used in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ ly &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there are no ports to be found out of which one is selected . ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name is probably included a DVB @-@ in .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player is only X@@ Video , it should work only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux monitor must be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be used in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interface and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional set @-@ use application . under Unix @-@ like systems , you will probably return to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution including the installation should be used for the installation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile packages ; for several districts . these enable simple installation without further compression and can contain on the k@@ ile ; web site .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users need to be hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are required to the documentation . if the support is required for this project or its documentation , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; web page .
ask questions or comp@@ ile at comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if required , this will be mentioned on the mail@@ ing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual for Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile users can also begin directly with the reading of the chapter with the editor &amp; Kate .
for &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; it is the right to use : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if you use a La@@ ie ( English ) &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ mac@@ ro you can use a La@@ ie ( English ) &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . however , a less sophisticated but realistic design is that it comes from the name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here is a good idea of view to &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; it is not the ultimate book , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ HF , 3rd edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
similarly , as other reconciliation we includes &amp; L@@ ate@@ x , an introduction , with the text @-@ to @-@ use and text format , as well as text format , start @-@ up with the command \ \ 1 class and must be closed again with the \ \ &apos; command .
the quick @-@ entry Assistant Manager of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a nice document for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some males for the creation of the document . some may also be made to the document related settings .

when entering a new version ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos;s command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically an empty line ( e.g. \ \ \ to { command } ) is automatically activated by the command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu of the settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally divided into several elements . &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; the sub@@ organization of the document on the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ) :
with the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective .@@ Änderungen rück@@ gängig machen
when creating your own &amp; l@@ ate@@ x ; -@@ files can be done very helpful . as soon as a DVI @-@ file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ am file ) was created , navigating &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer for the corresponding line in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the most important output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ ate@@ x . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and installation of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and righteous .
when using the DVI @-@ file , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file is spec@@ kl@@ ed and soon as required to a element in the DVI ; source code . as soon as possible on a section in the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ( source code ) , it is possible to apply to the appropriate position in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
master document : this function is used with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simpli@@ fied with other integrated .@@ tex files . during the use of a project , a project can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
file &apos;s settings : in this mode the DVI @-@ file will be used in this mode , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it &apos;s not a call for &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; depending on the quick construction .
regarding viewing the editing tool , the three large @-@ size selection fields should be developed into the document . the first selection process has been designed for fast delivery of the document , chapter , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands for the maintenance are :
the selection field will be available for inser@@ ts of articles such as key@@ words , Fu@@ Ã ¤ notes or dup@@ lic@@ ences . the ver@@ itable MÃ ¶ g@@ ations are :
designation : with this command , an designation for a section , an image or different element is created .
terms of reference is used for reference to a fixed label ( selection of a selection ) .
in case of quot@@ ation is indicated for a select list with literary view . the author has good experiences with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the details are also written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the final selection field with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ ni@@ b is used to set the font sizes for the main text , which are set on foot . there are the following font on the following characteristics :
with the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two selection of the selection for creating a new document : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document as a selection of the document and presentation of the settings . 2 . this document can be written by the hand .
the cl@@ amps after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font sizes . if the font is set not at the beginning , this can also be done on the text .
as soon as the above source code is given , the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x must be compiled ; the easi@@ est way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s or the button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; the storage allows you to store automatically .
sli@@ ce the document of the document should be searched for the failure . when using quick construction should be started . when using quick construction , the ey@@ epi@@ ece was started ; this is not the case , should also be applied to the protocol .
a environment ( too . environment ) is a text which will be treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report dra@@ gged on the font or even a few months should work on the sign@@ post of the font size within the area - Giant Sl@@ ig@@ â ( English . Hu@@ ge ) .
the entries are only within the environment ( of \ \ to @-@ { Do } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no longer notice ( number ) in the surrounding area within an environment .
there are many people to compare the read and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain font , fat , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , will be added either with the \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Müller { emp@@ t } : this command is designed for short pressure and long as long as long , until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word can be represented in a set with \ \ emp@@ h { word } curve .
\ \ D ratio and quote a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ a { number } and ends with \ \ end { number } .
after the background for writing the source tex@@ tes with the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; this is now represented by a step @-@ in @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document into &amp; k@@ ile .
as soon as assistant , a bit text was given , a few adjustment for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . they should be a quot@@ ation , a few positions in fat and courses , and a poem for application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document can be seen , using editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E can be re@@ printed again to the internal viewer . with an external viewer , the window must be closed at an external viewer .
as soon as the DVI ; file was created , the document can be converted or into one &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file is converted . simple , try and fun too .
DVI ; is a simple one @-@ day file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi -@@ Edition such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar light turns the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; source code is created , the conversion can be seen as well as other formats using the buttons in the tool bar .
the pre@@ amp @-@ search goes to the direct jump from the editor to the bottom @-@ up position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; only needs to be balanced with only Modern among the application ... tools of construction .
in order to feed the pre@@ amp @-@ search , the mouse is positioned in a row of the source tex@@ tes and to be cli@@ cked on the pre@@ set @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then so@@ unded .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click on the middle mouse button ; document the corresponding &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; document from &amp; k@@ ile ; we have to be set ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; be set up in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; be set up as a text editor .
if you want to use quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer cannot be wrong , it may be an error message , it will be indicated in the protocol file , or in the news window .
the protocol file is used in the source code . as an editor , the protocol file is pre@@ supposed to be used in the source code . if you are able to view the error correction , you must be cli@@ cked on the error in the protocol , and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps on a faul@@ ty line .
as soon as on the appropriate button in the tool@@ bar , a window is available to choose from the template model for the document . the default authors may be adjusted :
in selecting the document , a document can either be written from the ground or to the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . additional information are included in the section .
business users of &amp; L@@ ate@@ x , use the same introduction for almost all documents . templ@@ ates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and uploaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new model , you must create an existing &amp; tex ; - / L@@ ate@@ x file , or a new model can be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new model using an existing document and a selection of file &apos;s original document ...
when creating a new document from a presentation to the New document , some character sets are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings .
at its own presentation , it is therefore necessary to know what the variables will be replaced by the variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this character will be replaced by the input in document class . typically , it will be used as : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; .
the easi@@ est way to create a model is the use of the assist@@ ants , making it the commands in editor . once the document on this way was created , the following steps was closed :
when creating a new document , the own model instead of the standard format is fully balanced .
a model can be created from every &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; files are created . a simple way to create a model , it should be searched for a presentation on the Internet and which can be used below its steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the presence of text files ( including also &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for ¼ r &amp; Kate ; can be made out in the Men@@ Ã ¼ r &apos;s tools .
to learn more Ã ¼ ber &amp; Kate ; and his MÃ ¶ g@@ ations should be attracted to the manual of Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; in addition to the reading of the chapter with the editor &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; a command set , which can be called for the help of the La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an adequate description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; use them as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with a dr@@ ink@@ ed shr@@ ub . this means that this way , on the \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when running the tex@@ tures of the tex@@ tes with a dr@@ au@@ gh@@ ter mouse button , the full text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , the key button with covered parts of the source tex@@ tes in the editors of the editors .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the latter has the ability to look for a wide variety of types of source tex@@ tured as well as these characteristics . for example , the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands by normal text and mathematical form@@ ulas are produced by a different colour .
there is a number of assist@@ ants inside the text , as well as the respective keyboard player . this jump brand will be able to jump into the jump , or the respective keyboard brand . it will also be shaped like that when entering the first input of a character automatically .
editing is probably one of the principal effects of a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already superb functions for writing a &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; special functions for creating a &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text commands :
pre@@ heat a complete section ( group of lines , which included on both sides ) , ( as in other text editor ) , which is only one text on both sides , and commands and all other lines of the source codes . the only known thing in &amp; k@@ ile , is that the two @-@ day lines are separated by two le@@ ak lines .
as a result , the word under the current cur@@ rant position . this choice has also an extended meaning as this command also &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands with a sitting area ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for example , to be a part of the document can be nat@@ ured . &amp; Kate ; for example , the key line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile is equipped with its own commands . &amp; k@@ ile ; it offers its own instructions for faster adults . under editing the removing are included in the following commands :
remo@@ ves a complete section . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile , is included in the description of editing , etc .
it was already clear that environments is one of the central role in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x . therefore , &amp; k@@ ile is among the most important commands to edit in the environment for a better work with &amp; L@@ ate@@ x .
this command is spec@@ kl@@ ed at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . Cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command of the environment .
this command will be spra@@ yed to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . Cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the shooting of the environment .
when the cur@@ sor is mounted or within the final \ \ \ in the vicinity of the area , will be spra@@ yed to the end of the environment ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering the input of many co@@ ach@@ ts ambient , quickly can be lost so quickly . this command lay down the last surviving environment , so that the environment has not been cr@@ ushed on the site .
&amp; k@@ ile ; it also offers special commands for the &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; groups that are caused by cl@@ amps { ... } . under edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to edit environment .
this command is spec@@ kl@@ ed at the beginning of the current group , ( regardless where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the fli@@ pped chamber .
this command will be spec@@ kl@@ ed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the sof@@ tening agents .
when the cur@@ sor is located or behind the cur@@ bs of a &amp; tex ; group # is , will be spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
when entering many co@@ ach@@ ing groups , groups @-@ cl@@ amps can be lost quickly . this command is not least , so that the so @-@ called structure of the &amp; tex &apos; structure will not be ru@@ ined .
in &amp; L@@ ate@@ x , two simple instructions for use is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the signs &quot; for the purpose of this is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two sle@@ eves for two reasons .
this automatic instructions for double bond issues may be found in the settings of K@@ ile , ... La@@ Te@@ X .
there are also more useful settings ( e.g. n@@ wrong or French ) and in order to be used for the French or fran@@ chise model . many more languages are available .
at the Dr@@ yer of Shift ; input key &amp; k@@ ile is a smart line . if the current position within a lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ emi@@ ze ) is situated , not only a row , but also at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables , &amp; k@@ ile with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to be pre@@ set &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under the settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added ) .
some users were able to arrange the columns in tables , environments , and so all E@@ t signs ( amp ; Alt ; amp ; search@@ es &amp; k@@ ile ; according to the table Tab@@ ulator is not available . although this table is not available , depending on the table ; in some of them the columns were added to the columns , position of the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; however , it has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; for example , it has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; three of them are available in &amp; k@@ ile ; three of them are available for automatic applications . all of these modes , all these modes have been set up for different work .
at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ in the environment } , &amp; k@@ ile is automatically added to the \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( the text for the text ) .
when Dr@@ Ã ¼ ll of the R@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ oo button is the last letter of the input and fitted to the fully functional list . on the other hand , the list can also be supple@@ mented by an additional letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are also written with a quick description of your parameters , so that a simple jump to these positions will be fitted with edit stamps N@@ Ã ¤ t stamp . once again , the parameters then be replaced by approximately ) .
among settings ; en@@ vis@@ ors ... k@@ ile ; complete settings on these lists . it can be done on different options for use &amp; tex ; - and &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands and W@@ ate@@ x options as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ aby@@ tes of general language used .
in response mode , there are always a large number of letters with \ \ has a large number of letters with \ \ A . on the other hand , environments is so often used that &amp; k@@ ile is used ; in addition , environments such as k@@ ile is a special mode for the fully functional environments for applications .
at the call of the fully @-@ game mode , the command will automatically be connected to the command of the environment , and it appears to be \ \ &apos; s command . then the ambient can be completed on the sim@@ pl@@ est way in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and it is completed by the input to the input button .
after this process , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile , recogn@@ ises the lists of a lists , is even a first \ \ item order with approximately ) .
under Settings , Speci@@ es ... k@@ ile ; detailed settings are made on these lists . this mode uses the list of fully functional mode for use &amp; tex ; - and &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile , on the site set the lists of demo@@ li@@ Ã ¼ ations , which is now available , as an example of a clearing list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file is included in the example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X file .
for example , the letter L is given and the word will be added to the use of the list , for example , the key@@ word can be replaced by the keyboard / Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
spacious W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ restrial rooms are not helpful . however , it has been noted that many whales are written in a document more than once . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the complete site for everyone has been written .
this mode can be set up in the settings of K@@ ile , ... K@@ ile publisher will be screened again . here , the swelling value for the ad will be set up .

dialogue : the graph@@ s of the graphics is available as simple as possible . to meet the parameters of the video formats , the sections should be applied .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but we offer excellent basis for use and re @-@ orders of pages . the PDF output will be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf file .
to convert the outcome of the work , must be compiled for source code . all construction tools are compiled in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s creation , convert and changing view .
for the comp@@ ile of the source text ; for example , the DVI / file can be used by Alt @-@ 3 . however , the DVI @-@ file format can be found in the standard format . however , the DVI @-@ file is converted into a PS file and can be seen by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be seen .
when used for use the quick @-@ level , a viewer can be called on to comp@@ ile . should not be used , so there will be a new window .
a new project will be awarded the new project for the new project .... &quot; the following information is required for the project :
when applying the fil@@ en@@ ame fil@@ amen , the relative path has to be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile , allows the scripts of EC@@ MAS@@ cri@@ pt -@@ Ko@@ de . sk@@ rip@@ te by scripts on a vertical body can be managed .
the API scripts are still not endless , and can be found in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile , in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
as the first one must be said that the discovery environment of the scrip@@ ting in &amp; k@@ ile is a different object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; is a quite unusual system where the basic functions can be expanded through a wide variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different filters for the users of the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; they are supplied with many documents . it contained a documentation for the packages and a further &amp; L@@ ate@@ x ; reference .
there is a complete set for use of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is ideal for use for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is ideal for a very large setting , it will be divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; a very important document is divided into &amp; k@@ ile .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the best application of the right document provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the full use of texts , which provided a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and out for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the pri@@ stine advantage is the search for package names or stroke . from &amp; k@@ ile , only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed of the v@@ aste of the viewer for the document .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools are using comfort as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t as sub@@ location . the combination offers fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation is a pro@@ c and how over@@ seeing it &apos;s . let &apos;s see it even a piece , we give it a graphical user interface ! no more on a terminal framework ; simply the symbol of the XML processor is ready and ready !
this application awaits a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the file . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the folders . if you don &apos;t remove the current labour file . if not , they remove the selection of current work@@ places and give it the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are displayed in the same file , as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time , if this pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone involved in the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are now a great graphical user interface .
if the just opened file index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then it is simply chosen the current labour file . if not , then they choose the current labour file and give them the file a where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an issue on the screen , your file is broken . please check the mistakes and try it again .
if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; , then it &apos;s the actual file doesn &apos;t appear in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if not , delete the current file , check the h@@ ooks and select the file again using other file - file selection .
if they only want to know if the file well @-@ one is , click the well @-@ in @-@ up review .

the plu@@ gin , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; don &apos;t have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can &apos;t wait until someone can do the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can &apos;t find plug@@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used .
to install a plu@@ gin or a plu@@ gin , we begin to edit with the menu plug@@ ging . so the following dialogue is open :
this dialog is possible to manage all the plug@@ ins and add new products . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . adding plug@@ ins without a memory location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path takes part of the plug@@ ins .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the we@@ arer and is used to clear identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can look for himself from the list of the team members , who is to search for it . this is what he is looking for the team . this is the current selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ name and the attitude of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is a further advantage by the acquisition of members of the team : it can be created an event to the team &apos;s team , when a bit happens . see in for further information .
event actions include actions that can be executed , if something particular is done in the project . for example , how much someone worked , or a script that will play a file , or a script that plays a file into the CV@@ S , once they will be added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the receiver in the receiver -@@ list of address data . the address can be a team or sub@@ project head . see in , W@@ ei &apos;s head are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
comments is easy . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by a message text .
comments may be sent to a single @-@ point member of the team . in this case , Syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , is a role in the project manager for the Group Head of Sub@@ project Head After the area and sub@@ project names , as shown in the following examples .
nick@@ name and rolling names are independent of large or small , but spaces by the cl@@ amps and the : make the note .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and formations , the DT@@ D @-@ free and web@@ based formations and scripts .
the settings are easily reachable by the settings . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for that of which can be found in .
the settings can be found using settings of Qu@@ anta ... called . Dies@@ er@@ dialogue covers some sides , which are treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags , including a car body can be changed . entries are :
large / small scale of Tags : large / small file from automatically det@@ ects tags : large Groß / small fraction means , the tags will be added , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small file from At@@ tri@@ bu@@ ten : large / small fraction of automatically generated At@@ tri@@ bu@@ ten . normal Groß / Klein@@ sch@@ tion means that the attributes will be fitted to the attributes such as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically dis@@ connect : if the hair@@ s is optional , for which the closing day is optional , this is immediately after that .
no optional Tags automatically include : how above all the other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and departure day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day will be modified and vice vers@@ a .
automatically det@@ ects acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic transformation of acute characters into the corresponding co@@ ction during the inser@@ tion .
M@@ IME type : measurement types for detection of different types of files . the standard inclusive standard can be restored .
standard drawing : the co@@ ction of newly created or in other ways as well as file opening files ( where the file can be negotiated by the file ) . however , this setting is loaded by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D will be used for new files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . this setting is increased by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates a backup copy , so when the program can be restored during a power failure or crash . that &apos;s not the same as the storing of the file . even for even un@@ stored documents , backup is created regularly , according to the required time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editors or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ on ) which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code to look at the same time .
set the window settings back on the next start is useful if the user interface caused by changes of the M@@ DI @-@ modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views from each other . it equ@@ ates to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line .
the warning messages served as taxes of ability to switch the display of war@@ nings through non @-@ longer questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be used instead of scripts as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in the shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , set in details .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the cli@@ pping of the structure with the mouse button .
in the structural tree settings , the visibility of kn@@ ots can be opened automatically in a tree that can be opened automatically . Le@@ ere no@@ ots are the empty areas in the text , whereas these groups are not found , in which the actual document is not found .
short@@ ened groups are valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . short@@ ened are valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means , it may be valid for PHP , which means that the i@@ f@@ ren@@ ew is valid for something different than in a group valid for Javas@@ cri@@ pt .
plug@@ ins can be managed by plug@@ ins . plug@@ ins are re @-@ managed by a third page which can be re@@ used by each K@@ part application , on the well @-@ known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; in the introduc@@ tory of a plug@@ ins must be specified following :
address : the path to plu@@ gin , if it is not on a stand , like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed by plu@@ gin to the start , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of current file ) or the project file .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check whether the plu@@ gin is ref@@ using . only L@@ esis @-@ K@@ Parts should be noted that this option is not elected .
check the plu@@ gin : is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the provided information is right . pick up the settings the contract , even if the plu@@ gin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
the troubleshooting , for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troubleshooting process was completely re@@ designed , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin concept has been implemented , which enables various implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plu@@ gin is available , the support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; the ant@@ ap@@ lus ; one adds .
the use of the Deb@@ u@@ gger for a project starts with the select de@@ bug plug@@ ins in the settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in select the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated , some additional elements in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view , displayed in the content of excessive variables will appear in the left Do@@ ck .
a view , in which all support points , with numbers of numbers and conditions are listed . normally , usually in the bottom of Do@@ ck .
a view , displayed in the copy ( such as HTML ) of the Deb@@ u@@ gger . normally , usually in the bottom of Do@@ ck .
dependent on the supported functions of the Deb@@ u@@ gger is all or part of the following functionality .
this promotion will be used for de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it will be on plu@@ gin to de@@ bug fix@@ es . this action will be opened by default when a project is open , that a Deb@@ ug@@ ger should not be noted in normal case .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Start the session . includes the link to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or finished the lu@@ te to meet .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to enter a Deb@@ ug requirements . this is also the use of using a browser &apos;s browser to look the current document . the issue of this requirement is indicated in the exhibition Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger , with the execution of the scripts and information on the over@@ burden , and that this happens when the script is being continued when the script is continued , when a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ing is started , the script will start with the requirement .
Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s debut , with the execution of the scripts , without information on the vulner@@ ability of the script . if this happens when a script was done , the version starts , as soon as a debit system , the version starts as soon as a requirement .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , without delay the functions or under@@ go .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes f@@ law@@ lessly adjusted .
it shows the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to go to the order , and to go to the next one , the current is not the current .

this chapter describes how to adapt it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs , and how you can adapt it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you can get better .
documentation type editing ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities such as car rentals and storage systems . their simplicity and flexibility makes out of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ up languages and family 2 . day @-@ file , consisting of two file types ; and day files with the end @-@ to @-@ day folders ( above the Edi@@ tier @-@ F@@ enst@@ ers ) , the text and instructions faster into a document as the user could be used .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be prepared ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details about the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to create , then the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . shortly , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for the same time as well as the layout and the contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ c file ; it contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool@@ bar allow a fast response to a document without a threat of a write .
day @-@ file is nothing as file . they contain only the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the day XML files . day @-@ file bear the name of the speaker language and version , so . ( for example , ht@@ ml @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of day XML , if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is wise to use so many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information regarding work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in the individual . all over the possibilities and borders will be put in simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only contain only once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it contains only a element type than itself else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type Class . the name of basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
when yes , the day has a common @-@ At@@ tribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type element .
describes an At@@ tri@@ but a Tags . this element can only be found only for any attribute . in addition , it contains additional tags , how this attribute is being displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ element @-@ element .
gives the swelling tex@@ te for the attributes of the attributes in the day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog , and At@@ tri@@ bution @-@ tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used for the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to feed the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a inter@@ locking and a method name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day that got the elements of a list . it can only be used for an At@@ tribute description only once . it is a mere element type element .
tables the position of At@@ tribute tex@@ tes of a tags in a Di@@ alo@@ gy . this day can only appear for any attribute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
there is the position and the size of a field in the dialogue . this day should be available for each field in the dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
gives a list of elements that may be allowed inside the relevant tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all day XML files have to start with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly and closed .
spaces changed no , but pay attention on &amp; &amp; m@@ lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ opping this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be replaced . this does not work any leg , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review of the Tag@@ XML file , the tools are to start at the top in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and rest@@ oring Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue is to follow , whose simple instructions is to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification takes place in the shop of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt . scheme &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ day .
in the following an example for a working family 2 day @-@ file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ lade feature is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file is to be load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; device = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / day &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot; / day &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is also quite simple and there is an editor via DT@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite DT@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be prepared ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; General &#93; version = 2.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simpli@@ fied name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
a action can be fixed with the settings . click on New promotion to the same dialogue :
this promotion is remote button . with click on the button user can be assigned to a key element ; with K@@ one is the current button bar .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the promotion , this text will be added in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see below .
this is the most powerful Action sty@@ p . with the help of this promotion , external applications can be used ( or parts of document ) , which can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Even are the Schnell@@ start @-@ dialogue or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
the first must be given the name of scripts and interpre@@ ter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
though qualified pa@@ ade are allowed to use the % scrip@@ t@@ ability : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scri@@ pts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document will be removed : / from the document name .
% pid : will be replaced by the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance running , the text contains unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script is used .
the parameter for this event is usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above en@@ umer@@ able methods , a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the standard input , which can be determined by default . in the selection field input can be intended to send the default . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only with this setting .
according to the input , the output can be sent out . there are two types of issue : normal edition , on the standard edition written ; error messages that will be specified on the standard edition , by adjusting the value of the selection box :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to create a number of logical groups in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool for each group . in this case there are not too many , therefore you can create a tool with the name of the brand .
once a tool added is added , you need to add actions and configur@@ able . select the settings .
the parts of this F@@ enst@@ ers are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button on the lower end of the F@@ enst@@ ers starts the edit mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the matching work@@ outs .
complete everything and if the rest of the attributes , and you plan to plan your use , enable you to edit Di@@ alogue &quot; Day , &quot; if it is possible to install a input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is a pol@@ ite symbol . if you should remember the action in connection with this icon ? replace we , before we have difficulties before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol report that the action will be better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ free ; select from the &amp; k@@ screen ; , graphics and programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select edit size .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you , what the promotion is doing , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
in mind that the day , I decided to create a starting head as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is usually considered to be interpreted , or should at least , a message for user sign@@ posted , that click this symbol no &amp; lt ; started ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action . this happens to be connected with the action ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press him .
if you choose the file , in which the stored symbol is set , select it and confirm you with OK .
press the application button and set them with other tags , so there are still what you are , or confirm you to complete with OK .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar or to be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bar dialog for the tool bar . make sure that the desired tool is selected .
I want to use Tren@@ ner ( at the left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the Element@@ es , to be added to the tool , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I want to access a quick opportunity to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner will support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or might be the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool bar must be tested by means of all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct file . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct file , but your business tool ( n ) should be loaded in the correct file , so that your tool bar will be loaded ( n ) , if one file is open from the respective type .
perhaps the notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form of formations . this chapter , as I describes one &amp; PHP ; documentation is for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has the already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you must search an existing documentation for the form@@ alities - / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file again . let &apos;s first part , let us handle the second .

note the # front of G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . showing that there are no known border to the tree with its own content . there are no known border for the chess elite deep ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it himself .
note that the table of contents directly onto a file refer@@ enced ( and consistent on the upper end of the construction area &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
no spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . this should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources Resources .
the ingredients for the m@@ ys@@ q@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function is shown here . by marking the function of the function called and pressures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for the context @-@ help , there are only two types of entries here : the text list ( Cont@@ ext@@ ingu@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of using separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
for example , you can store your file do@@ cr@@ c and save after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / payments / qu@@ anta / doc or global use . then you will create a file ( as if you specify this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these well and the value of important information is shared by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best Web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templ@@ ates ) with others . there are two ways to do :
you can send us an email to your friends , partners or otherwise who are sent to you . at different places there is an email address , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , you can send @-@ to @-@ mail support , in the context menu of files and folders in the templ@@ ates and in the scripts tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive . users can be downloaded and easy to use , if our team is available as correct and easy to make use the resources . to make use a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , the origin of the resources needed for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the pas@@ sp@@ ares ) , or in the case you can pick up several keys , you can check out the input of the new resource ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and click the up@@ loading of OK .
the up@@ loading can be loaded by the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , on the tool &apos;s tool , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templ@@ ates and scripts tree .
after downlo@@ ading the resource &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ance . in case of problems , it may be careful not to notice . if the integrity and the resource has been correctly with signature , a message will be provided with the Creator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not able to work by a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , the preparation can be easily necessary because hundreds of day files in everyday XML format could be required . there is the easi@@ est way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting to DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue :
objective : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE defini@@ tions : the character set out in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d is supposed to appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after transformation : when activated , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly developed &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand these concepts and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tried to build these concepts with these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection screens . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is stored in the joint memory structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators have a variety of tool , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements are a personal collection of web development for individual users . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in user contents , so that they can only use these users personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a certain project . this can be found within a certain project for the files of a certain project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are provided in the Ord@@ ner@@ baum project , which will provide common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editors window , the building view , the cart@@ on with information and tool bar . please do in , and for further information on these areas .
one can view the card with the right mouse button , to get a context menu with the actual document , like close the current , other or all cart@@ ons , re@@ loading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a read mark or execution of CV@@ S commands .
right to a further context menu in the editors of the document , how basic processing steps ( put / copy / single ) , machining of the mouse operator under the mouse station or opening the file , if the character can be named one file under the mouse .
at the upper end of the Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are currently listed ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Tran@@ si@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool being adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
if you want to add a simple day , for example , please click the icon to enter the day . if you want to set the data on this straight day . if you want a day to fill the attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill out in a dialogue several fields .
the information prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate up in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate it to open and move . in the presentation with cart@@ ons are available for files , project , sample parts , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation construction .
project management is a powerful tool to provide &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows you to use the files in the project with the right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or sol@@ ete files from the memory medium can be implemented with the context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templ@@ ates . almost everything can be a model , pictures , program parts , whole website &amp; etc ; There &apos;s all the possibilities are open .
templ@@ ates can be divided into three categories , depending on what they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range are always available , local templ@@ ates only for the corresponding users and templ@@ ates in projects are available in the project .
here you will find information about the available script languages . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can find more information on a script by clicking over the right mouse button . more functions are available , such as the script you can start to edit or send an email .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document can be set . by clicking on the position of the element , the Cur@@ sor is set on the position of the element . it &apos;s a list of commands in terms of navigation and collecting of the building .
this tree appears under the other construction area . with it , it may change quickly At@@ tribute and nam@@ ing areas . with it , it allows for changing the attributes of all available attributes with a few mouse cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download documentation documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ lus ; &apos; documentation , you can create their documentation , and by adding a Ord@@ way doc a project can be edited , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ons in the bottom of the f@@ enst@@ ers , can be reached on the useful information : the news window , and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta . thus , for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all modifications to the DT@@ D displayed .
this cart@@ on shows all the error in the start up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such that there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool to send an easy @-@ to @-@ use T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; K@@ mail . if they get a tool in an email , they can secure this in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the site of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files to your system . in order to get a complete list of options which you can get to the con@@ figure script . to understand a complete list of options that are easy to understand . / con@@ figure --@@ help you need to understand here .
if you have problems at St@@ arten from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin file , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin file . same applies for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide variety of powerful functions .
during the effort , the best &amp; HTML editor was to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ dable market @-@ up editor ? well , this would be the absolutely great most powerful web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now not far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . if you can define it in &amp; XML ; therefore , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , at the above claim that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; meaning that someone is not only possible ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; but it is not only possible to expand users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore it allows users to need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web development to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . it can expand the productivity of almost any task . by the program compression them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand , without any of the scripts . ( you can find it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed into an advanced Editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta . the original developers made the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the further details documentation is supported by help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changed , if you open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest entry was taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as preparation for the future use . if they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation to store only a mistake .
converted to the cli@@ p@@ board of the cli@@ p@@ board there is a special sign for &amp; HTML ; sc@@ iss@@ ary , enabling them correctly displayed and not displayed on your browser as a form@@ ati@@ fication order .

switches the block selection , respectively . allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button to select the button .
goes directly to a component number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages !
search for a character or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or defined with GUI and forward to enable you to help you .
the news window is not included . this is the window , in which you see the display of scripts and the Deb@@ ug@@ ger .
and on the lower edge of the re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ enst@@ ers . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as to change the structural tree .
shows the symbols bar left from the main window . this column allows you to set the reading with one mouse click .
if there is a Book@@ mark in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next , dependent on the position of Cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
read Book@@ mark the other documents in the menu are group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project of the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored by the fil@@ e.@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j files .
presenting a dialog for creating files into the current project . the selected files are copied to the project directory .
search for the project directory according to new files that could be there . allows , for example , video files into your project file or a sub@@ file to add them to the project .
the files in your project is to the server in your project . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE and if you have further inputs / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
invites a project tool bar . these will be stored in project you / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialogue to save your business tool . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
this dialog , to add a new tool to add a new tool . it &apos;s just added to the settings . work @-@ based tool@@ bar can store them or saved if you want to save the tool that you want to back the tool .
remo@@ ves a tool bar from the visible range . if you do not have the tool not stored by the hard disk . if you don &apos;t have the tool not stored , you will be asked if you want to do .
with this , you can send their own tool to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens up a new e @-@ mail message with tool bar .
allows the high load of tool@@ bar on the main server , where each other can access to any other . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you can download or any of other things , and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description formats .
load / auff@@ eur from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entries are expected from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; however , the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if that global is , and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folders is not available , failed .
this menu includes a list of tags which is loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains a list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current date settings dialog , if there is an entry . this entry is always available in the menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menu .
activated and activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ts of tags . currently this is only compatible with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent Simp@@ le means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is add with tool@@ bar ref@@ uses to resist the rules for this day .
in the plug@@ ins , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the above menu . ank@@ sgiving , activ@@ ating it . ank@@ sgiving of a activated plug@@ ins .
cho@@ oses the syn@@ tax mark mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ b@@ ings schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version from .
cho@@ oses the type of line label . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for the Develop@@ ers . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syn@@ tax of the current document on the selected &amp; DT@@ D document ; using the external application .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries may need time or without a beautiful graphics . it is recommended that the default setting is mode , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu contains an entry of each open window , with a selection of a contract , the appropriate window will be activated .
at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ enst@@ ers on the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main f@@ enst@@ ers .
the changes in this dialogue is using any application which use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
the behaviour of the editors of Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers is aimed at the documentation of &amp; Kate ; in the documentation of &amp; Kate .
a dialogue appears in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or what can follow and follow the line .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse button , but is not implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as at any open source project , the developers can always help help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form you will find here the way .
they are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled to the top of the project , as for example , according to the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all this b@@ ade and author Information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project @-@ properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . at the input of the name becomes file automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has changed the name of the project in case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you are the server address to the machine , which you want to access the local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if one can empty this field empty , the standard settings of the chosen protocol may be used . depending on the setting up the remote machine could be necessary .
this is the file to be stored for the project . it is a relative path for the project and by default Templ@@ ates . if a joint collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standards .
this is the file to be stored in which the tool for the project is stored . it is a relative path to project and by default Tool@@ bar . if a joint collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows , files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole file is selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and change it . if you want to download and change the sc@@ anners ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you need to go different .
def@@ endant , if files that are located anywhere in the major file of the project , are supposed to be included . if a project is set on new , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main board and you can make a exact selection to co@@ ils .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the h@@ ooks , cl@@ amps from the project .
the last display of the new project assistant contains three settings that make your work simple . these settings can be changed in the menu with project features of the menu item in the sub@@ window profile or with the button shift , F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant , and are described in described . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( square holder is possible ) that will be ignored with project planning operations as such as project association .
in addition to the additional option , the files used in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are listed , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded with the opening of the project . it can be read more about project inten@@ tions .
the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently , the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin will be stored in Gub@@ ed . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plu@@ gin can be set off with the button options . read the troubleshooting .
in the sub @-@ profile profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) may be set up as the display of a building view of the server for each profile , by showing a own building view of each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted , as well as a mail@@ ing list . see the details .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , you can add event actions to modify this actions , change or delete them . event transactions will be done if a certain event occurs , like that of a file a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was opened . this behaviour is not being able to influence this behaviour .
to open a different project , the project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save the changes in front of you , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you invite you a new project .
project management view is free access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
file is also common , however , the entries are open and opening with the right button button :
here are different profiles can be found here . the profile contains information about the site of the highly pivotal files . see .
allows the removing of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the switching surface is di@@ mmed to prevent the removing .
the password is easy to keep in the core memory and with programmer . this option is useful if frequent high load files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk &apos;s record is not in question .
this is stop to stop or simply leave the dialogue , if you change your opinion before loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a lot of high la@@ de@@ profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded into a variety of server . in editing , or creating a profile &apos;s profiles , this dialog is shown here :
this is the name of the server to be copied on the files . either a fully qualified domain name , or an IP address work .
transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , it is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them to be stored on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but each with programming can easily be seen in the box text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project for many views , that is , by easy change of view , various files and tool@@ bar can replace , and replace the opening of the files and tool@@ bar .
views on the menu or project tool@@ bar , can be reached via settings &apos; tool@@ bar tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; , with which one has to do most . this does not only increase productivity , but allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working class .
as mentioned above mentioned , factory gl@@ are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is the best about the menu tool bar . use and adding the tool tra@@ des@@ erts is treated at the section of the tool .
the tool@@ bar and symbols can be set either with the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , it can be done to choose from the tool@@ bar or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue , where the actions can be visible on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu as an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , in addition to remove action and promotion , the self @-@ explan@@ atory work .
the tool bar and the actions in them can be set up in the menu with settings tool , and set the settings .
templ@@ ates are included in the key element skel@@ eton , code cuts and files for linking programs . you can copy , postp@@ one or any one at system existing directory in the pre@@ set tree . templ@@ ates in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you are preparing for fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templ@@ ates , conditions for their use . please read the conditions before the use of each template &apos;s conditions .
bin@@ ar is everything that not pur@@ a text . it can be inserted in documents through to link ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / URL ) . some examples can be found in the pre@@ set tree among global deposits . for further information about the templ@@ ates is available .
documents can be created from any text box type . usually , a simple cor@@ st for the purpose and organi@@ zes the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre@@ set tree among global deposits . see for more information on the templ@@ ates .
this species is useful if not a new document based on a model but the same text area can be used again in documents . you can find everything about a note of a note system on Javas@@ cri@@ pt or Perl @-@ base . some examples are found in the pre@@ sides under global demand . see in for more information on the templ@@ ates .
as the name suggests this templ@@ ates for all sites as templ@@ ates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a standard tar archive . currently there are no examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
do you design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) , and select the file as template !
as soon as the happen is , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project position ) the template not visible in the project tree . check out in the pre@@ set tree among the project .
select text in your document and click on file as template . alternatively , you can store your choice as a local / project position . alternatively , the selection can easily be drawn with bricks and lay down on the templ@@ ates .
the preparation of bin@@ ocular templ@@ ates is simple : the file is possible only in a pre@@ dat@@ as@@ ant file . there &apos;s all the file management functions can be used , such as p@@ ushes and finish or add about the file &apos;s sizes from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can download in the file &apos;s file or in the project file to a folder on the right and site template , create a name for the template . by default , default , it can be saved in the project file , but of course , it can be stored as local or global template .
project pre @-@ oriented pre@@ dict@@ ation . you can give head@@ lines and head@@ lines or head@@ lines with &amp; PHP ; design , files inserted or with them . in addition , one can add some things when using templ@@ ates in projects very deep in the eye .
the device structure on the panel is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates to the files . each of this file is equal to one of four types of containers , as seen above .
to specify the behavior of a party , in the pre @-@ risk view with the right mouse button on the folders and in the context menu features . the following dialogue appears :
a select field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templ@@ ates . this selection is wor@@ shipped , as soon as el@@ ect attributes needed .
this is done by default , it would be done by default in this path . if a regular file would be dis@@ able , except it would be explicitly enabled in case of a normal ordination . if nothing appears to appear in a regular file . if nothing appears in a regular file .
the previous or retro@@ fitting text for templ@@ ates in this file . this could be used for a specific project or in lines for a particular project for a particular project with special head@@ lines / foot@@ steps a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , using context menu ( on show , right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding files or copy and inser@@ ts from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor . the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it is compatible with a document such as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor , in which the changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
with the V@@ PL ; editor to a document showing the V@@ oh@@ and@@ an editor and source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is necessary to change the source code editor . there &apos;s no plans to modify this behavior .
the second mode does not work exactly as the first mode , except in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ous . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is activated , the cur@@ sor to the active cur@@ sor of a window on the window which will retain the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor can be set automatically between the use of a click or a click . in addition , the recommendation can be adjusted automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted for quick computers and a large donation for slow down .
suppose you want to change the title of the Website . this is also called the editing characteristics of the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to change the reduction of money . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ Tags : the storage of information on the document themselves can be added . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons , e.g. key@@ words to the content of content , e.g. key@@ words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content of column .
CSS rules are the new way to the design of looking on pages in browser . you can add CSS rules on the list below list or delete . a change of the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to connect an external CSS label , by using the button open to the button , and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text area like in a text area . under some circumstances , the cur@@ sor is peculiar to the cur@@ sor . the marking works as usual . text can be folded through inser@@ ts and removed via a button or distance .
the entries of tags is done in the same way via the tool bar editor . it is aware that the add @-@ on @-@ day is not removed from tags : when a anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , every other surrounding anch@@ ors must be removed .
some works are disabled as the tables assistant or the lists @-@ to @-@ assistant are de@@ activated . later , in the &amp; V@@ PL ; it will work in this release , tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements can be followed , and the execution of the styles .

there are many graphical tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell you , why I have written .
the inter@@ connection was very complicated because one of the Beit@@ er many changes made in the same file . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the result was written by me , but I was not able to see what has changed within this lines . and there were no references to places where perhaps only the deposits had changed . the mer@@ ging of this changes was a small Alb@@ at@@ orial space .
that was the beginning of the start . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be found in a row and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare the text , simply copy him into the cli@@ p@@ board , and add him in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work , was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
this is also useful if two persons can run independently in a piece code and changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps you use any other changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result . this screen photo shows three qu@@ ell files at the inter@@ section :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete with the same and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with the folders :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows exact differences and user @-@ based differences on the possibilities of our color monitors . if you are frequent co@@ de@@ de , you will enjoy this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible in a certain number of white characters , you can see at a look at the summary of the column in the left @-@ hand side of the left . ( no trouble , if somebody will change the back . )
if one file is equal , and the others differs in one line , the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files have the same name , but in various folders , you can easily use the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by using the first file of the first file . example :
2 file @-@ cou@@ ner@@ 2 cou@@ ner@@ 2 con@@ ner@@ 2 cou@@ ner@@ 2 cou@@ ner@@ 2 cou@@ ner@@ 2 file diff@@ 2 files 2 file 3 file list
opening dialogue allows file to specify a selection of data from the file &apos;s file ( file ... ) or choose from the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file . if you need the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files .
above the button file ... you can select a folder if you select a file , if you select a file , if you use a file , if you use a file , then used &amp; C if you use a file , then &amp; D diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other files .
when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can process . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file . you can do this step later by the door .
the set @-@ button opens up a dialogue with settings . here you can fixed the options before you start with the same / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to get a lot of text , but only parts of a text boxes . compared to opening comparison , the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialogue , you don &apos;t need to select any files , you can connect the dialogue with the touch button .
you can also use bricks and finish , go simply a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall on a reference window .
the idea is behind ? sometimes it contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you should download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then compare these files . now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , add and then compare it .
note : currently you can not withdraw from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the text may be supported by text in a comparison window .
warning : a number of editors interpre@@ t the toes and text by text in another program , and add text ( instead of copying and inser@@ ts ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the Info window . ( note that window is optional ) and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path leads to a file for long ) , you can rest a while on the line . then a small aid window is the complete name . )
the three spring windows are the letters A , B and C . A has the colour Blue , B , color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this default settings can be changed over the settings . )
if a difference is detected , one can be seen in the color , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is well in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
left next to the text , the column is displayed . if differences are found in white characters , the colour is depicted . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is possible to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only available in character and commentary , for pre @-@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
vertical line , which separates the text , will be interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines . if the tick is activated , the line will be activated in line lines .
the result window ( under the reference window ) also has a Info line with the inscription : , the file name and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually , it contains a text which often contains it even conflicts .
! ! ! to all conflicts is dissolved , it is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to the most dissolved / un@@ spo@@ sten conflict to find out the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative reference is used , each difference is also solved a conflict of the manual at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line is displayed in windows , where the group will not be visible in the windows . this group will be able to make the current background colour of background colour for current field , and is a black beams .
sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual , no more line will be able to change or by manual , but you may change another source but again . this text appears either in the final stored file , nor in a Mark@@ ing which you may copy , and weighed differently .
the text &amp; lt ; context con@@ ic@@ ing ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy these text from the result window . go with this function around this function .
note : if you select the sources to ignore or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
if you are using a window and mouse , you can use the arrow keys left , at the beginning , end , Str@@ g at the beginning and end of the end , si@@ can use it from other programs . the over@@ saf@@ ts column can also be used in addition to the vertical image . click here to N@@ avi@@ ews .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can change it between single and over@@ sh@@ utter mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button , synchron@@ ized the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group ( as already in section of the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window .
the tool@@ bar includes seven buttons on navigation to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture above / Str@@ g image downhill ) , next to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l picture above / Str@@ g image ) or the next / previous conflict could be viewed as a conflict . therefore , the equ@@ als must be distinguished between sol@@ ves and un@@ rest conflicts .
to copy the mark into the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to copy the copying button ( C@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g ) . if this option is activated , automatically enter the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual head . be careful with this option , for you could acci@@ dentally installing the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board may be mistak@@ enly deleted .
in accordance with basic operating system , UNIX variations are stored in accordance with basic operating system \ \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the source of source code files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored in the next start . ( menu entry - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 , ... )
choose a writing with solid width . ( on some systems , the dialogue also provides the writings with variable width , you should not use this . )
if you activate this option , differences in cur@@ ated Scrip@@ tures . if the chosen Scrip@@ ture doesn &apos;t support this representation , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be shown in their pure form , but would be straight away . to these systems , the button is automatically introduces to an odd color .
when this option is activated , the values of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you press input or Return , the re@@ plen@@ ishment will automatically be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is activated , each choice will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual will copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which to@@ ggle @-@ type @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the general usual selection on the operating system used .
at the same time , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines are ignored in the source code . only during this first step , white characters are ignored . this step is not ignored . in this step , white characters will not be ignored .
some Edit@@ ors ( on some systems ) is identical to a car , but then , files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , though files are evident with different sizes . however , if this option is enabled , however , use a white character sets . during mer@@ ging , this option must be de@@ activated . in the default setting this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , the numbers and matching signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
in the default setting this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensively after even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically and jump mode , this setting is displayed as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is spec@@ kl@@ ed .
sol@@ ves automatically dis@@ sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file . if you are using it only from time you need to use W@@ ähle A / B / C for all non @-@ time conflicts . if you need to ignore the selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options can ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in Chapter to scanning , folders and ass@@ esses of a mer@@ ging . look for details under documentation for the directory @-@ comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already exists a older version , the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original version . if you already exists a back@@ up@@ side with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without any other backup .
the language of the user interface . change you need to end and restart the change program . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language will be set up there globally . )
the following codes can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it is used for all entries the upper setting .
about the selection fields for coding appears a short note , what the local coding is . ( this can not be modified here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this is influenced by special characters and interpre@@ ter . since the co@@ ction for any file is adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared to and together .
if you have any file , you can specify here , which is to be used for storing .
if you use pre @-@ processing , they may not work with your codec . ( e.g. , your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code may be used , but the processing command can only use only 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can design@@ ate the code of pre @-@ processing .
this allows you to supp@@ ress the changes in the text or review of changes in the text or comments . ( note : this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options can ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences between two files are shown in a color @-@ enco@@ ded over@@ clock ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; B ; C . in addition to the normal , a second over@@ clock column is displayed with the necessary information displayed .
sometimes you want to use the available place on your screen for long lines . simply beat the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
set the comparison side down to each other or next to each other . this can also be useful to displays from long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences between the files and then compare the files . a simple click starts to compare the file name and uses the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the mer@@ ging again , then the name of the most recently used output file is kept . )
when reading one file , she is visible at first order . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can write your own pre@@ processor , that &apos;s exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example , cut off parts or to correct the rec@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation .
when reading a file , she was given to use this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the pre @-@ processing command is used . you can only write your own pre@@ processor that &apos;s exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding edition line .
the thought has been behind , the user &apos;s more flexibility when creating the di@@ ff results . however , it &apos;s an external program , and most users would not want to program the good news , but the good news is that in most cases or per@@ l .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert the input in large book@@ ings : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ 1 / \ \ 1 . the \ \ 1 must be found on the first text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ age . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the text @-@ mentioned text in major book@@ ings .
CV@@ S \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you want to understand , you may understand it , and maybe you like this regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ign@@ ace of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for a further processing command from &apos; s &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ des characters ( &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you &apos;re looking to perform several discounts at once . then you can use the semi@@ col@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the vessels of each other . example :
instead of per@@ l , you can use a bit more details like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / Er@@ l / SCH@@ AL@@ TER / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / Er@@ l / SCH@@ AL@@ TER ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos;
data after the normal pre@@ processor will retain for the ad and completion . the other operations are changing , only the data that leads the same @-@ off @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ pre @-@ pre@@ proz@@ essor is the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful but as with each function , the text changes or differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences , and in the worst case important data .
often you need to process programm@@ ers in a folder many files . from that reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete file extensions and lead .
... makes for each object a proposal for mer@@ ging . you can adjust the proposal before start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and simul@@ ated changes to simul@@ ated changes , without they really perform ,
... leading actions in either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) .
this is very similar to the same and merge of individual files . you only need to specify just file on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders will be used , files will be used as the basis . if no target file is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is used as a target file .
note that only the comparison of files automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start the mer@@ ging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while the folders informs you a small news system about the current progress . if you break the scanning of the file , only the files are listed , which until then were compared until then .
if the scanning of the folders , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows a light window with the results on the left , ...
every file and any folders the scan was found here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
by clicking on + / - click here . you can use a folders by clicking on the + / - click here . the menu item includes two functions of all types of sub@@ titles and all sub @-@ directories with which you can see all folders and can be installed .
if you click on a double @-@ click , the file comparison is started and appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name is reflected the file yp in the first file ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the data type is different in the different folders , this can be seen in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane . in such a case , the connection watch is not automatically selected . if the mer@@ ging is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as can be seen in the above picture , in the columns A / B / C , colours red , green , yellow and black .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries are different .
files are identical as identical , if their entire content is identical . then also file is the same color . with files , the age is significantly reduced for its color .
the idea of this color is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors of a sheet is back , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B is identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C did not have the same file type ( eg . if a file and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as those faul@@ ts exist , the mer@@ ging can not start .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( eg . if a file and B is one file is ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as those faul@@ ts exist , the mer@@ ging can not start .
mode for synchronization is active , if only two folders and no explicitly specified target file is active . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is synchron@@ ize . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action shall be identical . if required a entry ...
... A and B does not exist , but not identical are : mer@@ ging and the result in both files . ( the user looks as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after the mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders will be connected to the file . if the files are different , but the same date , then the files are different , but the date of your files are different , but the date is identical . Sol@@ ange such errors cannot be removed , the file can &apos;t start the file .
while mer@@ ging a file is described , if the mer@@ ging is successful . if the connection has been successfully concluded , and other mel@@ odic , if the mer@@ ging is completed , you should see a final review and see whether the status is used everywhere in order .
if in the setup dialogue has chosen the file sharing method of solid analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 further columns . these include the number of non@@ represent@@ ations , sol@@ ves , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ itary conflicts is indicated only if three folders are compared or together . )
you can either use either the just selected entry ( file or folder ) or all entries in once . if you have selected all the plug@@ ging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have no target file , then in the Three @-@ file @-@ merge mode C is used as a target , when the two @-@ files switch will be chosen as the target and the synchron@@ isation is A and / or B .
if you have a target file , please check if all entries are displayed in the target file , also in the file format . there are some options offered by certain entries to be transmitted . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises :
to add all entries to the directory : select directory @-@ up / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard hur@@ dle ) to perform the current element : select the action of the current Ele@@ ments or press F@@ 6 .
when conflic@@ ting data types still exist un@@ certain mer@@ ging actions , a message comes to the faul@@ ty elements , and you can select a valid action .
if you carry out all the entries , a slide @-@ window appears with the options , simul@@ ate and break .
if you want to simul@@ ate if you &apos;d like to see , no changes would be made without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then certain actions starting with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window ( please note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to start with a file , you &apos;ll have to restart your directory or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have stored , a corresponding dialogue appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next entry .
if you &apos;re looking for a error message , you will see a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will need to move again to the problems of problem . if you have the possibility to solve any other action for the entry or to solve the problem in other way , before you proceed with the mer@@ ging .
if some entries were together related to yourself , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries have not been specified in the current session ) or not stored in the later . even if you are using the mer@@ ging , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries are together again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 , ... ) has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern , are displayed in the elementary pattern . it can be given several patterns with a semi@@ col@@ on ; valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . file must not match this pattern .
files and folders are displayed in the Element@@ als . it can be given more than a pattern , use the semi@@ col@@ on ; as a partition sign . it is valid for : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders are displayed in the Element@@ als . it can be given more than a pattern , use the semi@@ col@@ on ; as a partition sign . it is valid for : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default setting is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ res files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ zed files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files are hidden -@@ attribute . in other fil@@ esystem . this option allows you to choose whether these files are displayed in the Element@@ als or not . this option is switched on in the default setting .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic connections compared to . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links show . this is activated in the default setting .
links to file : if the option is switched off , if the option is switched off . if the option is switched on a folders such as normal folders and if it would be switched to an End@@ less loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; short@@ ened . ) This option is down in the default setting .
performs a full analysis of each file and shows the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of sol@@ dering , non @-@ white and white conflicts ) . the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if they contain on files that are not included in files . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ patterns . )
if you compare big folders about a slow network , it may be faster , only the change dates and the file size . however , this speed advantage is to be able to use safety . please use it with caution . this option is possible in the default setting .
similar to the change of changing date . it is no real comparison to the files . however , the files can be viewed as large as they are equal . however , if you want to use the changing date , please be careful to use it . this option is possible in the default setting .
the synchron@@ ize mode is activated when two folders and no target file . in this mode the suggestions are identical to both files and files are stored in both files and files are stored in both divisions . this option is down in the default setting .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as a action . ( this is supposed to be aware of the file that the other file is not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is down in the default setting .
if a file or a file is replaced by another backup or delete the extension .@@ original file . if an old backup file does not exist , so it will also be deleted the normal range of individual files , not only the figure of full files . this option is switched on the default setting .
normally the file @-@ link may usually be visible in the file . if you don &apos;t want to move the window with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to divide the option / text window , switch to the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window to switch between the two views .
probably , you prefer to get a menu of double click on the file . as soon as you can store the file &apos;s file . as soon as you save the result , the status is done to do and the file is not re@@ plen@@ ished , if you start the files .
this status is lost , if you again lost the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help of Ki@@ o @-@ Sla@@ ves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote machine .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed tour with a local file .
a URL has another syn@@ tax as local files and folders . please note :
a path can be relatively und@@ one . or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls not possible , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations :
or it may not be distinguished if a link to a file or file shows . then always a file is assumed . ( FTP : , FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change dates back from the original . ( please note the option of the size . ) ( This is only in local files possible . )
the main practice is currently in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op started to start a built @-@ in differences on the viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part this context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 is used ; if you have used a patch file in the format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . if you need to exist at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing files .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview . please note that not the original files does not exist . moreover , this is not reliable when the original files have changed for the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part 2 is carried out , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or file is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compli@@ ments ) already exists . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 has already suggests that it can run like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot of knowledge to the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers you have gone or go so .
if you have compiled the program from the sources , con@@ figure not the right pre@@ fix ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) you can &apos;t find the code for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . you will find more information about this subject .
if only the number of white characters will be differently , these lines are differently than the same ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is differently , the line will appear as the same as not identical . IF lines appear to the next to E@@ ach other , this is , but this is the case .
the editor is recommended for every difference in the files where he starts and wherever he ends . however , this important information is lost , if the result is simply saved as text file , and it &apos;s worth much effort to design , extra an own file format , which may save this information .
the expenses for this was so far too large . you can re@@ produce a certain version for a source A / B / C . to process large quantities of text , an other editor should be used .
according to the text , No sr@@ c is suddenly ; no sr@@ c has appeared , and the text can not be er@@ ase . what does this and how can be removed from this text ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used for many colors as well . more high@@ lighting might be confused and missing the purpose . do not use any other editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . many thanks !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE , 3.1 or later .
information , how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes are found below htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE to comp@@ ile it , use the following command in the base file of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folders in your system , which is installed in K@@ DE . if you are un@@ certain , you &apos;ll find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ ile . however , please , in trouble , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mail@@ ing lists .
cut out the cli@@ p@@ board ( C@@ tr@@ g @-@ X or Um@@ bre@@ alt @-@ removing ) . add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ b position , or replaces the current marking .
only differences : files that are identical in all types of files , not in the Ord@@ way structure , and therefore not in the target file .
( in the current program version you need to update changes to the file with the function updates . )
there are only entries that show differences are displayed in the target file . if the target file doesn &apos;t contain these files , they are missing them after the con@@ figure . ( the behavior is likely to change in a later programme release . ) This option is in the default setting .
note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are not able to run on a window at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they are already present on the button to the button .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . normal differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is a miniature show of all virtual desktop space . it is quite convenient to change the ongoing programs to the desktop space , it can end their size to end or postp@@ one it . this works both within one working area and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can all virtual working areas as well as the ongoing applications . the applications can be selected and even moves on the working space and to be moved .
with the middle mouse button , window inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible in both working space and other working areas .
the context menu depends on , where the context menu is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the text @-@ menu is provided ; however , the symbol and the name of the application and entries are min@@ ted , Maximi@@ eren , on working space and berries .
maximi@@ zes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if the application has been cli@@ cked .
sends the application to the selected virtual space . appears only if it has been cli@@ cked on an application .
if the check@@ box is marked , window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ( s ) can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also other working areas .
when this field is crossed , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual space are displayed .
crossing of this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the numbers of the virtual desktop space . it is possible to take the names of the virtual space , the names are provided with files , &amp; eg ; 1st work area .
if this field is crossed , the backdrop of each working area is also shown in the background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the ongoing programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only empty space is displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple right corner with the profiles of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map . note : pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is known in a 2x@@ N hit@@ ch , like from P@@ ager @-@ applications in some other Window@@ s- ; it shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal p@@ umping and ver@@ tically in a vertical row , which is well suited for the representation at the desktop area .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control system . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the window as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs out of the control system .
click the right mouse button inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent ex@@ pressing switch , ... can appear to the Di@@ alogue settings .
at the moment it can not be changed in the dialogue : but you can do it manually manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor or register for your system administrator . in this file , you must apply to the key win@@ dow@@ ment mode in this file , and that &apos;s worth a value possible . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended by new features . it is optimised for use on the weak computers .
if you &apos;re looking at &amp; k@@ mag ; the window of the screen is shown above . in the following window , this window will be shown as a large window window . the image , which is displayed in the En@@ large window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described as a selection window .
alternatively , you can make a mo@@ vable screen . alternatively , you can choose a mo@@ vable screen . alternatively , you can make a selected screen area ( pres@@ sur@@ render mode ) or to the surroundings of the mouse button on screen ( eg ; on the left side tables ) .
if you want to make sure the mouse is shown in the enlarged window . please note that the mouse may not be able to detect the shape of the mouse . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and can change his size . this can be done in the following manner :
move the mouse button on the large terrace and keep the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the En@@ large button . this is also compatible with arrow keys .
if you are additionally to press the &amp; Shift ; button press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection box will stay and only the lower right corner is able to move towards the lower right corner .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , into a file , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later in other applications ) , the image turn and much more .
start / check out the update of the display . the stops of this update that the required CPU time against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , low , mean , h@@ och , very high ) . the higher the Update , the more CPU time is needed .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated one mouse click on the same site as soon as the mouse is thought to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repository stra@@ in @-@ in@@ consisten@@ cies ) , and those one mouse click the pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated one mouse click on the same site . it is thought to help people who prepar@@ es it to Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ it ( R@@ SI ) syndrome , and one mouse click on any mouse click . however , this requires a little exercise with the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain without any pain without any pain . unfortunately , you can also ask pain with the usage of your computer , if you are looking for a doctor if not yet happened .
to make it clear : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps with pain in the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the beam because of the mouse is used , us@@ eless and as with all ergonomic equipment : the result can be selected for every different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and carries a mouse click , as soon as you break the movement .
if the mouse is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it is done by the mouse button , before the end of the mouse is carried out . this way , you can execute the gyp@@ sum of the mouse button . the smart bre@@ eder requires a little exercise , but you can get rid of it quickly .
this thread has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ fel@@ lows is switched on , the turning point is set ( 1 / 10 s ) . here &apos;s the time when pressing the mouse button , after downlo@@ ading the mouse button , if there is no change in the mouse for the mouse .
this function is activated by a slow view to the left and back , followed by a break , one click on the right button . these movements will be stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt file ; the first time started , but it can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can choose between the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go on to sound &amp; multimedia , go there on sound &amp; Multimedia , then you can adjust the sound equipment here . there is a sc@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , set the lower value to reduce the response time .
this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently available under &amp; K@@ DE ; available in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the particular documentation to find out how to start a program .
if all settings back to the opening of the di@@ alo@@ gs . have already shown the button to set the button , the settings are set in response after the last d@@ ots of application .
best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially , with the default settings . in particular , the smart bre@@ eder should be switched off . if you have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can get the intelligent delay .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of cl@@ ash .
first , you should make aware of a mouse click without any effect : the cli@@ cks on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window , does not constitute a link . you can use the mouse to such places , until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is pressed , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite simple . the tri@@ ck is easy to clean the mouse , but also the rolls , which come with the mouse ku@@ gel .
first , you need to take out the mouse ku@@ gel . as this happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quick to view the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball , you would have to see the rolls . you can find yourself at the sides of the hole , where the ball has been used . mud and so@@ iling , you can easily have a flat blade or a finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system used the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you want to move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will not end in this case ; the operation doesn &apos;t end to finish the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; under a different window manager and a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . as a result , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will come back , and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , trying to lead &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue using mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you do not want to go through a neutral frequency due to the mouse buttons . thus , safe zones for the mouse station are spot@@ ted , safe zones for the mouse buttons and menus , and the title of windows and the title of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent lighting , but I didn &apos;t make it to edit the text .
the smart machine is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or add any other action to move into a mouse button . but it is likely to prepare them to prepare them . here are some advice on this way :
do not use the intelligent slide when you &apos;ve just started using a mouse click in the end of the text area , and keep the button button , while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click on the mouse button . thus , you know exactly when changing a mouse click . later , you can use the intelligent slide without the audi@@ ble &apos;s mouse click . however , it needs a few exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it must be installed , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window , must be installed in most of the case .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available , if the system has a sound@@ card and speakers , and this is correctly furnished .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse button . this program was devel@@ opped for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome , and those interested in the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in fact that a certain period of time is going to be left , before the mouse button is left , even before the mouse button can also be carried out .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with silent users can make their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can talk about the computer . users can choose from a list with the discussion sets , which should be again spoken .
on the first page of the assist@@ ants ( lin@@ kes screen photo ) , enter the command , later used for the language edition of text . further details will find in the description of the setup area .
on the second side , select the default text box . you can choose from the text pass@@ es@@ days , you may choose to choose from the text pass@@ es@@ days without being able to need them . text pass@@ es@@ days can be processed .
on the third page ( right @-@ off screen photo ) , the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language will be able to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can also select the word lists with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , so that only correct letters will be absorbed into the Wor@@ ds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for key@@ presses in your sets ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a stroke memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can hear the sets , you can hear in the input field you want . any spoken sentence will be hang@@ ed to the mer@@ ry memory . you can select it sets , which should be spoken again .
using the menu entry settings , ... open the entries dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue includes two cart@@ els , language edition and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ning and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input of the card voice command , enter the command to the command of the language . in the selection field under the input field you will put the drawing , with the text on the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types , the text on the text . select the check@@ box when the text remains unchanged as standard generator at the voice generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text is given as parameters . you can use the following square holder :
of course , the command is on the language edition of your voice generator . this command you will find in the documentation on your language generator . examples include you in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if the first thing is to keep it on this page . if the first thing is to be ignored , the German text will be ignored . this option is a standardized interface for voice messages and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you &apos;ll find action by the button of a text room or by choosing of a text room in the menu of text pass@@ es@@ or , or in the rental for text@@ books .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage will be added directly and additionally into the s@@ ect@@ s@@ memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text will only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection field of the handling of the processing device for text pass@@ es@@ or , you can design@@ ate whether the text may be saved automatically at the closing of the processing unit .
if you want to store the book &apos;s selection , the text may not be stored . if you ask changes , the text may not be stored in your text , you can ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text may be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ restrial contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ restrial field . in addition to the input field , this list contains more than a dic@@ tionary . with this selection field you can choose the current dic@@ tionary .
with the buttons on the site you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add , the order of books change or add them into a file . below the list you can choose the name and in the selection box the language for the Spanish Dictionary .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; it reads the frequency of the individual words , simply by off@@ ence of the determin@@ ations . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Off@@ ic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary , to add only correct words into the new Dictionary .
with this option , you can lead the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask that dic@@ tion@@ aries live together , and how these weigh@@ ted should be taken .
with this option , you put a new , perfect dic@@ tionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically into the dic@@ tionary , create a dic@@ tionary with your vocal .
the main area of the station for machining of text pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ holes is two divided . in the upper part , the text fits as tree structure are shown .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you &apos;ve selected a text area , you can change the text if you &apos;ve selected a text box , you can only change its name only .
promotions like new text pass@@ ages or books or selected text pass@@ ages and books can be adjusted to either the selection in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a folding menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ ters or text pass@@ es@@ days , you can change the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and Alt @-@ Alt ; button .
the chosen text will be cut and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is used , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ ali@@ ers .
the chosen text will be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field is a text section , this will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ ali@@ ers .

is this menu entry , a shift tool for often used commands . by default , the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ aw@@ ning left side , and the tool can be shi@@ fted to another place .
is this menu entry is crossed , is a narrow body in the lower part of the main f@@ enst@@ ers with a state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status is hat@@ ched .
if this menu is depos@@ ited , a shift in text box is indicated by means of the processing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ aw@@ ning left side , and the tool can be shi@@ fted to another place .
probably , you do not have the command for the language edition or not complete it . open settings ; be set up , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the language edition . ( see picture options for language syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free to use and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice issue , the festival is installed in the folders / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a built @-@ in &amp; Java ; it is now possible to use the English language versions . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free to use and spread without restrictions .
in order to show the command line for the establishment of the language edition , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folders / usr / local / fre@@ igh@@ ter . the language edition is possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard single standard . ( this is the recommended example of the Free@@ T@@ TS application . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of ph@@ on@@ gs in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need a additional program to use the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , using the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / transformation fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is pleased to add the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign is needed . the full command is more complex than in the other examples :

the language @-@ D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice guidance available on all &amp; K@@ DE ; K@@ TT@@ SD is now further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language versions .
since the setup of the language will only take place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you &apos;ll need to use only clips to be used as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth is needed for about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that can &apos;t talk about the people who cannot be able to spend text by the calcul@@ ator . a list is already saved , which users can always be re @-@ enabled .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth is no language syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a module of existing modules , which makes it possible to use the text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice guidance ( T@@ TS ) . it offers a joint application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers is ready to use with T@@ TS capabilities . users can also offer interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; but if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications is embedded in .
the language edition is performed via the program sel@@ ector , different background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell script ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the texts of texts a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; in conjunction with a text file , or partly read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) will find discussions about htt@@ ps / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / search info / K@@ DE @-@ Acces@@ sibility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acces@@ sibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need to install a program Dis@@ patented and correct . see also
at the first start of kt@@ oo@@ cyte or as long as a speaker , the cart@@ on board is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card board is displayed . see .
most of the T@@ TS Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , or those that can be found in volume or speed . you should also be able to set up a speaker , before you are using a speaker , before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; they use the program speed Dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise the standard speaker .
different speaker for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with several printing points for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ on @-@ site speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the cart@@ on board is displayed . this appears automatically when you start a kt@@ ts@@ i and is still a speaker .
all of the speakers appear in this list . the choice of choice will appear in the list . the speaker will be used for voice guidance if an application has no speaker .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
choose a speaker with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in a row on the list . in the list the speaker in the list is also intended for priority .
click on one of these buttons to contact your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose from here a vocal type , there are three male and three female votes as well as a j@@ unta and girls from a selection .
if you click here , the new speaker is on the board card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click to edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you are able to check out if language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is going to be able to read the text ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . click here to read text files . click on card card orders to create text orders and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can set the language configuration system from &amp; K@@ DE . click on the cart@@ on card , to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check@@ box to activate the web site ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can read text orders , and you can read text orders and can read text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; K@@ DE .
when kt@@ ops finished , &amp; kt@@ ts will continue , will be able to activate the field language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) in the field .
this An@@ cru@@ z@@ feld marks and kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr with pre @-@ read automatically in the system area of the control system , will disappear again as soon as the pre @-@ read is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can hold text orders , hold , hold and hold again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board read or read a text file . you can also open the speaker for a job .
click on application or OK , then all modified settings are taken on all sides .
card orders will only appear when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the anti@@ trust card and cross it voice guidance ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can check the text the text may be read , and select the text which will be read on the text , and choose the main menu tools . after a short time , the language edition should start .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can jump this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ press lines and other un@@ visible brands also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor &amp; K@@ DE ; you can check if you can read the text that read the text which will be read on the text , and select the text in the main menu tools . then you should start the language edition .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ;
K@@ No@@ ti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you want to dis@@ solve you by you . you can read the text of this messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the text of this news .
in &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C programme of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can call different types of messages . you can see some kind of messages that occurs in a IR@@ C channel , you can see a message in your nick@@ name . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can read the IR@@ C news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ No@@ ti@@ fy , will be a menu entry in the menu of the program . these possible settings can be found here for K@@ No@@ ti@@ fy , depending on application .
filter for drawing program is a good example of one @-@ time frame ; it is a good example . it is an excellent example . it is removed by orange and b out of the messages , which may be sent away , and also the expression / local / in@@ box that may be assumed for most cases as required .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter is not necessary .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before being sent to the program for the evaluation of the evaluation . they are useful to improve the evaluation of the evaluation , for example a matching language and speakers , or to select certain defects of voice syn@@ thesizer and its votes .
in order to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program works &quot; dual @-@ Dis@@ patch &quot; with a text works . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differs four kinds of texts .
the screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern issue has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ fted by all other contracts . if the issue of screen reader is pre @-@ read , the contracts will be continued again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has continued and holds the issue of news and norm@@ ative text .
messages have the right highest priority . for example , if you read &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; I can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just missed the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; messages are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . everyone &apos;s order to make orders of card orders , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications used by text orders . text orders are thought for the edition of a few lyrics , which have no special features .
all four order types will be processed in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ ments . if an application reads the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre@@ reads , this issue hold and ended .
first you must know that filter will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern . they are used on normal war@@ nings , news and text orders , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ news .
filter edit the text and give it to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there is still further types of filters .
character set replace parts of a text by other text , or as regular expres@@ sions , you can specify either as a regular expres@@ sions , which allows you to use the chat of the chat ( e.g. - ) by text or for the change@@ over of messages from &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understanding form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former are using a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in SS@@ ML ( included in SS@@ ML ) .
you can send orders depending on the text content or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have set the text by a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE @-@ messages to read the text by K@@ DE @-@ News .
each of these filters has an adjustable rules for which he is used for a language edition . if the filter is determined that his rules is not able to see the text in the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; - notification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all the activated filter , which will be set aside at the bottom , processing through the filter in the list below .
this shows the list of the standard filter . is a filter is not crossed , it is not enabled and is not used . filter will be processed from above .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and there will be shown below the following setup di@@ alo@@ gues .
to specify a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparative pattern . these patterns found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the appropriate replacement text . large and small scale will not be noted when compared with comparison .
give for your filter a name . this name allows you to choose any of the names , only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the drawings in the column and replaced it in accordance with the character set out of the column . the list is shown above . the list is shown above .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file , loading the current list or delete . download a list from file , entries to the existing list .
here is a language display , the filter will only be applied when the speaker for the text order is provided in a registered languages . click on the button to select a list of languages , if you have the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button .
if a value is registered , the filter is only applied when the text is used by one of the specified applications . you can choose several programs separately by com@@ mat@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , K@@ mail
the application ID program will receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers you need to register . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 must be copied only .
the flash filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter is needed . are all input fields are empty , the filter will be used on all texts .
in comparison with words , use of drawing filter regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. The words must be limited by a partition ( no badge ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guidance on regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; prints you will find in the package .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ form@@ ations . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c need to be installed on your system .
enter the path for x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , it is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
you can send the lyrics for a specific speaker , which is set up on the board of speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . you can set the text by an female voice by K@@ mail from a female voice . see also , for example .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter gives you a speaker to the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker , the text of the text , and the characteristics of the speaker , speaker , and the characteristics of the speaker . with the Speaker &apos;s choice filter , you can write the chosen speaker .
if a value is registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; pay@@ out &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions , you can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to get a faster work@@ manship , you should try to an@@ cho@@ red the regular expression at the beginning of the character set , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you select the properties of your doctor &apos;s choice . if the text contains the above all filter conditions , the speaker is chosen to show the desired requirements on the ground . click on the button to indicate the dialog elements .
use this buttons to save your language settings or to load or er@@ ase all settings .
speaking filters only will be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen provides even if all conditions have to be checked for at least one condition .
the language API , from &amp; K@@ DE ; with programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , which can be added with the syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , so you can use this syn@@ thesizer .

KT@@ TS works with every language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ; it can be started .
the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be in@@ fully or ob@@ sol@@ ete , and therefore , the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops ; for information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; dual @-@ Dis@@ c@@ cher &quot; program uses an adaptive module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of a different syn@@ thesizer manual , you set up with the developers team in connection .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is used but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program called &quot; dual @-@ Dis@@ c@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source tex@@ tured by &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ ctors , or every night , Tar@@ ball downloaded , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first , if you work with your language syn@@ thesizer with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf file .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program ct@@ t@@ ms@@ g can be used so that the device driver is directly possible and the script of the SPD conf must not be needed .
a long text is broken into individual sets . the user can go back into , repeat , or cut them , to repeat the issue or cancel .
if an application is set up of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , if you have set a speaker , it will be set up for a female chess speaker . if you want to learn more about the best number of speakers . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you will see a speaker , check out in .
if you click on the board , add a speaker to add a speaker to edit and edit a speaker , the card speaker &apos;s card is displayed . for example , the module &apos;s installation is displayed in the festival Interactive . for details on the modules you will find .
enter the path to a detailed festival program . if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you have to enter the festival .
choose the drawing for the text , which will be handed down by the festival . in general , the setting is automatically checked in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern European languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these shooting , adjust volume , speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can not select any controller , and these grey can be displayed , allows you to select a loud voice in this settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to be charged with their size several seconds . if you mark this check@@ box , these votes will be charged on the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed by the first sentence .
if this check@@ box can &apos;t be selected , you don &apos;t have a speaker to click ( or forget to click on application ) . see .
if the check@@ box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ s@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , the symbol window is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system segment to display the program window .
if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ ed , it will not appear in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text . this allows you to read the possibility or ste@@ er the possibility of control .
here all orders in the qu@@ eue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the number of sets , the number of sets , and the only sentence . the spokesman @-@ ID corresponds to the column of the column .
with the buttons in this series , you can select sat@@ ise in the list below , which is chosen in the list below , or return . ( but not any order consists of several blocks ) .
with a click on OK , all modifications of the settings ( also on the other box maps ) will be short@@ ened for the icon in the system segment . click on this icon to indicate the program window back .
if the sound system &amp; box is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card card . see also .
here are only text orders and manages . issues of screen re@@ alities , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops ; you will find here .
here you select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled ; either support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul compiled or cou@@ ts ; can do not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de will be used to choose the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the rate speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal room rates . thus , these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on application to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system to application .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them are not work . you need to find out what the device is working with you .
on this box map , you can choose special actions which will always be executed , if the text order will be interrupted with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern issue has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ fted by all other contracts . once the issue of screen reader has been read , the contracts will be res@@ um@@ ed again .
war@@ nings have the näch@@ sth@@ al priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot@@ ly . a warning holds the issue of news and normal text . this will be res@@ um@@ ed after the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message is provided . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth . nevertheless , someone can welcome the space .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output in the waiting for a long time .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order has been interrupted . if both input sound is active as well as the introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played in front of the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this cart@@ on card apply only for normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and spending on Screen Re@@ a@@ dern , there is no special actions when through a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ ti@@ fy @-@ News can be read , start with m@@ gr and click on messages .
mark this An@@ cru@@ z@@ feld to read the pre @-@ read &amp; K@@ DE devices . it is not marked , the remaining settings are disabled and reads ; reads no messages .
if this setting is selected , messages will be played where a sound is played , of which a sound will not be read .
use this buttons to add events to the list or delete them . if you click on the button to add a dialogue , where you can select the application and add the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , sent &amp; con@@ vers@@ ing ; sent out if someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events , which is nothing else specified in the list , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this selection field , to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops ; should do if an event meets the following selection :
if you read a user site text , enter the desired text . you can use the following option :
here you can select the characteristics of the desired speaker type . standard cho@@ oses the speaker from which the list is displayed on the card speaker as an upper entry of the list .
note that there is three levels for events . a particular event is defined for a particular event . otherwise the action will be executed for all other events of certain application . the action will be defined as the last opportunity to carry out under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all al@@ erts for the application ( all other events can be deleted from the list ) . for this , you can set the pre@@ dict@@ able messages as follows :
use the kno@@ cks to save the settings for the messages stored in a file . if you want to cover the events with the events in the list . if you want to start with a empty list , click on sol@@ ete . all entries are not deleted except all the problems are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for control of voice , the volume of the voice and the pitch . furthermore , there is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , a further W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ops are currently supported ; SS@@ ML are only partially only partially only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default terminal , the festival in the SS@@ ML edition is used .
if the settings for speed or sound system in the festival configuration is not available to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; SS@@ ML text is usually considered very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters , normal filter and pun@@ ching filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . as a result , it can &apos;t be syn@@ thesi@@ zed as if the first sentence is syn@@ thesi@@ zed , or return on the card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
here you see the stat@@ eless filter . with the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will automatically set up a set @-@ level filter . you can modify the settings , or further import trans@@ border filters , but will not be dem@@ ol@@ ished .
the easi@@ est option to check out the device selection and check out the text selection . use the Speaker selection and check out a number of features and check out how the speaker has changed . do you need to have more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then , faster with pre @-@ read , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which is very long last ,
you can keep text orders on the card orders or break , even if the language syn@@ thesizer will not support this function .
for this reasons the normal set @-@ level filter will automatically be set up when you start the first time . it can &apos;t be folded away , just away . change nothing to this filter , unless you know what you do .
stat@@ ute filters compare this text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tab@@ ular number ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to set automatically from the text ( table below ) . note that the default stat@@ utes filter will be connected to the character .
SB@@ D filter will never be applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ news ( k@@ J ) , war@@ nings , news or the output of screen re@@ a@@ dern .
if you prefer to check the normal set trans@@ border filters , you can add this back into &amp; kt@@ ts , by adding the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file standard .
on the card of Spre@@ er selection , you can write access settings for the application . card card is indicated when
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words , there are no Speaker properties .
use of the appropriate microphone speaker , the characteristics of a set speaker . if you choose the speaker &apos;s settings or edit , cho@@ oses the speaker . otherwise the speaker is taken out of the speaker , the speaker which are the originally set for the original characteristics .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the administration of network interfaces , the routing and DNA settings are possible .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enables users to manage a series of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings over a single , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to users the users of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings made from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings are shown in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched through a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network settings in the &amp; k@@ screen .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ worked conf ; the device shows at all , and setup of network features .
in most cases , drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices with the Inst@@ alls of &amp; Linux ; installed and installed , network appliances need to be loaded by the following files in accordance with the following files :
the module settings can be loaded , if the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the index is selected . with the types of modular network settings , this platform requires automatically identify the system used in the system .
if the platform is not recognized , the list is offered to choose from the distribution and the relaxation and the best way . by marking the setting up non @-@ again questions you can permanently set off . when the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically pre @-@ configured .
the settings of the network settings can only be viewed in system management mode . previously , all the settings can only be viewed , changing mode is not possible . in the system management mode , you can order by clicking the button mode at the right lower end of the module mode . it &apos;s the input of the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider networking interfaces can be used to manage the systems of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter network interfaces can be supplied from the following tasks :
the settings can be processed by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . ank@@ ment of the button Advanced Settings shows the dialogue with further options .
the TCP / IP settings can be used by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . in the selection list the TCP / IP settings can be used with any system requirements . in the selection list can be used either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
the TCP / IP address can be made in manual without any D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . IP address should be specified in the input field IP address . the net@@ mask network mask is the sub@@ net@@ mask @-@ mask .
if the setup is marked , the system initi@@ alized the system interface in the boat . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog , are displayed as a characteristics of the device in the device .
it should be sure that the IP address should not already be used in the network . with ping out of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . you can find whether the desired address is already in use . in any doubt the network operator should be requested .
network appliances can be activated , depending on the need , or off @-@ off network interface , you can choose from the list and click on interface . ...
network appliances can be activated , depending on the need , or off @-@ activated network interface , can be carried out from the list and click on interface . ...
the IP address of the computer in local sub@@ net fixed the physical connection to remote network , and will be used by default with the TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ network .
if the computer has more than a network interface , the interface must be chosen to the grid , in which the Gateway computer is selected .
a computer support is replacing the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer has htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the nam@@ ing solution of the equ@@ est@@ ator provides a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be used by selecting a record and hin@@ ge in the list with the buttons , or down in the priority .
by clicking the button on adding ... from the group calcul@@ ator can be added a DNS server . it will add the dialogue with the New Nam@@ da@@ ver .
first you need to add the IP address of the DNS Ser@@ vers and then add the button to the button . entry will then be added in the list .
out of the group calcul@@ ator on the name resolution you select an entry and then click on the button , ... It will see the dialogue .
the list is especially well known for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNA server .
normally contains the list &apos;s most well @-@ known computers are some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ ho@@ st@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are still supported . this is still in the test , the version of IP is intended to replace them in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address provided by the well @-@ known computers and click on adding ... The dialogue is also known as .
the name of the known computers and adding the button to add the button . if the well @-@ known computers has several also known as its name , de button add it several times and the other also known as a name .
select an entry of a particularly well @-@ known computer from the list and select editing .... The Di@@ alogue of calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with click from OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes to activate the changes , the following command can be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the Source tex@@ tes .
the installation of the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is sufficient , if &amp; K@@ DE is installed , and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install rpm package for download and in a console ; with rpm like follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic surface such as but@@ t or the installation tool from its distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is not required , but in addition , the development plan with libraries and other things needed .
this is only experienced users recommended . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net conf ; to comp@@ ile it . the following commands should be made .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; sel@@ ectable configuration files are acqu@@ itted .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only are basic information about the integration of the PCs in a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never discovered large spread . of IPv6 , it is expected that it is in the near future . these description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to be able to modify the IP address of an network interface . in foreign networking sites , it can be requested via a valid IP address or if required , D@@ H@@ CP can not be used . any case , the IP address can not be easily elected .
if you want to use one of their own small ( home ) network interface , the IP address should be selected for this purpose , to avoid IP address orders with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below will not be rela@@ yed on the Internet , therefore , their use is possible .
of course , the access to the internet for such machines are possible by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , usually addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net mask usually set 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that takes place the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route will be required for the IP further .
network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circuit .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; they are affected in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is dynami@@ cally in accordance with DSL connections , so it does not be surprised when in case of active DSL connections to find another content as defined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand is expected .

click the right button to a file or file in one of the archives and choose in the menu . ...
as soon as the re @-@ production process started , the dialogue is changed for restoration . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work@@ places for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialogue appears to be changed . this dialogue shows the progress of the re @-@ balance and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the index@@ ing file by using the band@@ in@@ hal@@ in . this process is an extension to the existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
as a result , a sick@@ ness profile is created with the just marked files and standard settings . you can select the following settings :
the current labour file , which should be made up to backup . the list of saf@@ te@@ at files is automatically updated in accordance with the chosen work@@ file .
for all file that are listed under the backup files are indicated that only the files are backed up on the same file system , such as the file . folders that apply to other file systems . each entry is tar independently from the other .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have been changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ ap@@ shots will be used . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to change the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
sol@@ dering the sn@@ ap@@ shots before the call of tar . this causes all files and a new sn@@ ap file for the next backup is laid out .
the functionality of buttons files are su@@ cks ; and there ; and lt ; files at the time of creating this documentation is not fully implemented .
the settings can be set on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings , you can make the settings the following settings :
the complete path for the tape drives for the tape drives ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ alizing version of the band .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated into the drive . with some drives , this is necessary , before read or write operations can be carried out .
if the option is switched , try &amp; k@@ dat ; this option does not work out at any tape drives . possibly it does not work with all the tape drives .
if the option is switched on to integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band is subjected to the band . use this option does not use at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ines .
if it is switched to change , &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ cover size for tape drives . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether it is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size is available for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band @-@ form@@ ert , writing a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only show a storage block on the band . the content of the file carries out as follows :
( n byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the size of this drawing is : seconds , and the name of the system is form@@ att@@ ed . seconds , the number of seconds which have been passed since the era has passed away in which the band is form@@ att@@ ed .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can directly manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it does not include in@@ incre@@ mental sick@@ ness .

&amp; k@@ system log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; tool for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can obtain information about your system , or where the system allows you to find out more information on your system , allowing users to find fast access to information about problems on their server .
&amp; k@@ system log ; helps users to understand what your calcul@@ ator is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which is not knowing where you can get information about your system , or where the system allows the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users quickly access the fast access to information about problems on their server . &amp; k@@ not@@ log ; therefore , some more advanced features are shown to be fil@@ tered by using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system log ; a number of useful functions . among other things , among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slog @-@ Ser@@ vers and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions are available , with their help , the individual protocol lines are easily fil@@ tered and absor@@ bs . individual options to be sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first of the system &apos;s most important messages , you have started , and it will probably take place in a small news system ; the protocol file is usually taking place in the folders / var / log , for the normal user , don &apos;t have any permission to read for reading .
you can also specify the filter bar in fil@@ esystem . in the default setting , the filter bar will automatically be displayed , allowing you to select the filter file . then , a protocol line will only appear when in one of the columns of the filter search is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry in this place . select the column in the filter file , and carry out the column in the filter file , and carry out the name of a process that shows you &amp; k@@ not@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent to that by this process .
this option is activated in the standard setting , allowing you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are indicated with the most striking color as protocol lines of the stage . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off .
would you like to see only certain trial ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , for example , if you wish to examine the output of a specific statement as such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the filter bar .
in addition , you can jump to the new lines , in the context menu of the main f@@ enst@@ ers to enable all the new protocol @-@ line lines .
&amp; k@@ system log ; enables the ad to use several protocol files into separate windows . to open this function , use the menu in the menu window to open additional window , as soon as you have chosen a window , select the menu to display the menu .
&amp; k@@ system log ; has an own web site to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software are@@ .@@ or@@ g. . you will find additional current information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system log .
&amp; k@@ system log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archi@@ ved : k@@ not@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V Pos@@ t Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V Rec@@ t system develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program starts at the high drive system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD range .
I will not continue to see here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything else : - ) .
the so @-@ called Bin@@ o@@ file is under / s@@ am and not under / etc . This is why maybe someone could try to take a machine to the V of the bottom , without a new installation and new format file . that &apos;s why you have to be sure that the old desc@@ ending from there was there , if there was there .
the SY@@ SV Ini@@ t also differs from the BSD Pos@@ t that the configuration files are located directly in the sub@@ ord@@ ner of / etc instead of them directly in / etc . this file is c.@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scrip@@ ting . basically , you need a script for every system service you want . system services include such as network , NFS , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ serial , which only started only once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be found in the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d . if you don &apos;t have much use this file , even if you want to do some of the serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do some , what do you want to do with the serial connection .
kernel is looking for various occasions according to the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the initial range , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can look into the second column . if you want to change your hand , you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand and change the 3 change . if you have a bit more , then you will repair your system , then you &apos;ll need to start the system and execute the following :
but how do it starts all the right scripts ? if you enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this file . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how do you start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? just simply : each of the scrip@@ ting is so written that it accepts a argument and stop . you can actually start these scrip@@ tions actually on the command line as follows :
this would be the htt@@ pd @-@ server . it reads the name , and if the K includes the argument , the script will be called . if he comes an S , the script will be called .
some people would like to build a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could have to run only htt@@ pd , &amp; s@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ run level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . it should not be difficult to be difficult because the program was done so user friendly as possible .
use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand , simply tri@@ vial : pull out an entry from the area of sharing system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it at this level ( or stop to stop ) .
you can also modify scripts between Run@@ levels , or modify the position within one levels , by putting it differently . this is not only if it is possible to pull out an entry from the area of sharing system services .
note : entries are shi@@ fted into a new area . to copy it to a new running level , you &apos;ll have to choose from the menu , or from the context menu , and in the target range , even if the same entry was already exists in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ row number of entry may not be charged . in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service .
note : at present there is no possibility to restore the entries , which were thrown into the paper basket . let &apos;s carefully .
you can use tab@@ ulator button to enable the various working areas ( sharing system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop and etc ; ) as well as the Cur@@ sor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one .
to shift an entry into another run level , postp@@ one put it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add him to the desired Run@@ level with entries ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort or modify the names of a entry number , pressing the button to change the properties tab . do not use the dialog elements in order to accept the changes , or press the changes to the changes , or press the changes to the changes .
because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file , before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . otherwise they are available in the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise changes are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the default settings are stored in a local sy@@ r@@ c .
I have made the machine with the standard running levels , and now launching the machine . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then , edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the standard run level to a sensible amount ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for version under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you have to view additional files in / etc , which are available only in these districts . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , such as system services are started in this distribution , the configuration is not valid for proprietary design programmes , but unfortunately not any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
if you are using one other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) just stop without message if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be seen from version different . if you are using one other distribution , please send us more about the Run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must store this . either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or entry in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cart@@ els , the user &apos;s user and user @-@ list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears to be the user &apos;s user and group characteristics .
some card cards are shown only if you have enhanced system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ on card can be made on individual settings . other card cards appear , if Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card card is appear when Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
this cart@@ on card appears only if for at least a set file system is activated ( Qu@@ ota ) activated and initi@@ alized ( it is recogni@@ zable to file for each user parameters ) , where users can be changed for each user , whereby space limitations exist in KB :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field system .
the map groups informs about the group of the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user &apos;s user , can be found in the field primary group . furthermore , users can mark the user in other groups , by putting it in the large field mark .
the dialog characteristics of the group includes a list of all users . to add a users to add this users in the list .
to add a user or a group , add the menu or group or click on the matching hin@@ ge button on the tool . editing or del@@ eting the selected users and the selected users work .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove the boot@@ able password , and change the time until the boot of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove operating systems , remove , change and more .
