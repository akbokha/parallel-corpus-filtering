<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the option Metadditions to the file site of the metadata. if you don't forget, then you can save the metadata from the database into the files by using the corresponding point in the menu album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change? and we'll find them a metadata editor for a number of selected attribute. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now you start the real work as you need to select any photo keywords, each of course you need to select the same attribute. you will start the best with the rating or leaderboard. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let us know it with keyboards, keyboards, as well as other programs are often called, or categories. all three are Synonyx for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you want to import the buttons on the right side of the Hierarchy of the construction is no problem, and can easily be sworn by using a subbaums on a other hand. the modified keywords are made of & digious; updated during the lower trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata. this is a very coarse representation, because each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. data name and calendar data are characteristics of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section, refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to catches your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">They want to know most anyone who want to see and share your photos, you want to share your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested as your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the Ferne is not even a nice beachfront page. if you look closer to see, you will see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to the landing site of the Allies & quot; Omaha beach quot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the labelling has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos, the title might be more important than the image himself. if you want to tell you a story, you think about the key to the viewer to help him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is in order if a picture is not perfect, if the strength has only work with a labelling material for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">You can also export your images in a detailed text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then you can export them to your wishes regarding the labelling field and / or the title of Web galeriesystems. so you need to tell the story so that it will be a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember times before GPS? when you have to find in another city without navigation system? it was not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures from the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">If you are able to repercussions for the future. I am sure that you can open your trips with Google Earth. you can also use the photos at the end of your holiday. you can also export images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Earth viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice the copyright laws to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedom also apply to all versions, so also for the work of other.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says you the information in the setting side of & digitization; when info should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for justice and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organisation can be changed. after this value, it should not be changed for no longer. this field is not supported nor semicolon as a partition.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author of the photographer (synonymous with the author): is linked to the author. examples include the work of the photographer. examples include, as an employee photographer, a freelance photographer and independence of commercial photographer. as this is a memorandum on the authoring field, this has to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use this photo is possible to identify the author's photo agency, as Reuters or Associated Press, then you can't know each other. if the image offers a storage photo here, then the group / agency is offered here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and Copyright sections, though they don't provide protection against abuse. every room has a digital watermark. for private individuals this is for the majority of your photos. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. there will be in the near future for such a module for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, record loss, power supply, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, restoration, reacanz, disintegration, life time, temperature, data size, spread aberrations</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs on the road or a fire. this kind of losses are the same as you can also happen with traditional paper photos or Negotiations. in this section it goes to problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data remodeling company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs that you can keep your CDs and DVDs to get more expensive than a few years. there's offers more than gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 that covers a life of 100 years for themselves. if you think that is in your measurbroom.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk to watch good discs and good recording devices. the best DVD movie devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you don't write a lot of reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to use. therefore, they are only effective for error, even if you have just written a control mechanism. despite this massive protective suits they are needed by chemical ageing, Ultraviolet light, Kratzer, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheaper program called IsoBuster. it runs under Windows and Linux; but it's also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications for damaged data disks, hard drives, Flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format of HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is said to be used for Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn your data to watch high-quality media in a non-propriation format. read the media with a clean, dark dry and in front of the protected area. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media, before you can read the last piece of hardware and software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanufacturer will keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantee a new disk, but not the data. Google introduces a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks: a discarding study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos are the most frequent error message in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in the lower temperate error, SMART can not recognize the error message. these are particularly reading aid and shift counter. the expected time period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss of low voltage due to overvoltage. of course, you can also secured data loss because of a power if you secured the files, but this loss can be used without any large problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are no longer enough, the use of devices with computer chips and high-speed scanning, complete data loss, motherboards, motherboards, and other defective. protect them even before the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most of the most widely used protection against electricity flows are an overvoltage protection. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in. however, it is usually available in the form of a plug-in. do not remember that any plug-in is also used for overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should be able to pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also be able to make the protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the correct connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since you can use any cable to your computer, you should be sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide easy-to-voltage for your modem. some manufacturers provide easy access to your modem. some manufacturers provide connecting opportunities for the coaxial cable of cable modems and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you're using a notebook, you'll need a portable transfer protection. a multitude of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore very small and you are also included the protection for the modem. this is ideal for you.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an easy-to-voltage your system could not be used for smaller fluctuations in power lines. even a fall of few seconds can lead to loss of unbearable data. therefore, it can be useful in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overtensions, these devices can be downloaded down to the system. if you have a USV, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. moreover, the life-time of battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">If you use the potential risk to avoid your computer system. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a smaller price-difference if you use. at the end, you should always remember all cables to trenne before you enter into the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store your amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives at home very expensive - 40 GB cost & Dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs. 500. in addition, you have to send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the main images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general safety solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services on photos. the professional version will be provided by Flickr dramatically. for $25 per year, you are using unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From view of the data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission error occurs thanks to the TCP protocol automatically adjusted and with the large companies are included in the offer of backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs are at least the data integral part of operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst is that nobody says if a transmission error occurred, not only if this is in your box. it's quite worrying that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought in your computer. no one seems to have thought that the internet with its TCP protocol is a much more safe data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network components are a further source of transfer rates, as they generate interepreferences within the data streams. in normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle high levels on low level. it's open source for solar and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms which used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% for working on. in case of notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss because of viruses is less common than the chisel think. it is currently limited to Microsoft-Systems; Apple users know only a few viruses and under & Linux; however, no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the most common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of remnants during a surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file doesn't work completely stored before the problem is lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras, 1-2 stops of fundamental physical limits are removed from fundamental physical limits. it is, that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are getting worse for compact cameras and high quality look. even DSLR cameras have increased its limit for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive can now be responsible for 100 & euro; therefore, you get another data loss in every year. secure your data often by a data loss, and try out this backup just like the new installation of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you have your sickness on an external SATA drive. if, one day, a flash, don't have luck when the drive was not connected during the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroyed a lot. don't forget: fire, water, electricity, children and steels are dangerous to your data. they are generally dangerous to all the room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore Desastertification is a non local store. bring your steps to the stairs up to the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above already, is a common reason for a data loss despite back up the panic. if you have a backup is not immediately available, you can save the one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are backed up. it is a snapshot-up without history and represents a complete copy of at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete safety. creates a complete snapshot of two periods: the complete safety device and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files have been changed since the final status. this enables the original status on each time again. this backup is used to backup any kind of backup by the exception that it is only abastray and constantly continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that can be easily changed to your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts. this happens to be compressed and if you want to increase the safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure key images directly after you have stored on your computer, a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and produce back. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot-up for each month. any further expansion should be done manually, after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, original file files, original file files, original file files, original file files, original file files, original file, scaling, media, relocate images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visible units,...</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable pictures the next 40 year survive, that is about the period of time you are interested in you, because they are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be applied:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is expected to be predictable. unfortunately, there is no other way to be able to consider it. unfortunately, there are no other chance to ask for any time of certain resources. however, there are no other variations in the past. however, less variations in the past, the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change any standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then do it and install it into a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safeguard technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability for the possibility of changing a system in size. this means that means, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us go out that you want the scalability to enforce the scalability, or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store the new record for a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but hang them not.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & No; size of the plate in MBU; does not work with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / corc1 # change the size of ReiserFS.</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not have any software that can read it, then you can create these himself. this task will be easier by year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format the slowly away from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard. it may be loss-free, XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many as TIFF needs, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression information. this format we would like to recommend you to your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression (default). however, it is possible that this format has been adapted to many people. so there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital input file format is a licence-free and an open source format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG is now available on the TIFF / EP format. DNG is now available, and we hope to use the competitors from Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why, in 2001 to replace its XML-based XMP technology; it allows users to modify their data into a file-cots. the file information will be stored on the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved the XML / RDF file.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers make it possible to archive your image file, mostly in the raw file. however, it can be stored at the link between the metadata and image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that support an open-compatible online metadata fields, annual conferences and workshops in the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and reconnectations to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or scanners. so long the images on the camera, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save this in your own archive. this function is not implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile process, you can use external programs. if you come back with & digitization; you should add the metadata. these were cut under circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the added images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact covers, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digious; you can add a description on your hard disk. the camera interface offers you as many advanced settings to impose images of your Albendship database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitization; you can connect them with the computer, switch the camera to display mode and switch them. another description you will find in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, when you want to connect a while. some cameras are displayed at the bottom of the camera. if this is the case, filename and a symbol of file association settings for any file, photos, films, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need to download the camera information on each entry. with the side of the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a single agreement or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information, internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image can't be downloaded yet on your computer. please note that in some digital cameras not all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata, such as Exif, manufacturers of manufacturers, GPS, etc., for the same information, the same as at the metadata fields from the main window of & digitization: or image editing. please note that these metadata with some digital cameras are not available.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, click the click on to download and download the photos from their camera. to download the photos will not be deleted, and we recommend you to check out the pictures from their camera to delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download any photos, you can select the desired number of your choice methods. as soon as you can download the button, then you can download the button, then you can download the button out as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is to download it is a Option. these pictures have been downloaded from & digitization. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in advance. if you choose this option, of course, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons for download or out, a dialogue may be stored in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums will be shown in the Section AM albums, and select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you've selected the target album, press OK, and & digitization; invites the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can remove this from the camera to erase you. if you want to erase your button. if you want only delete some erase you, you need to select these first and then select extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no chance to be deleted from the camera, and they will be completely deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the photos from the camera. if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, use the camera, as it is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filename for the photos are often deleted from the camera. this can be upgraded to double data, if you can download photos of different recording holidays in the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time where the image was done to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotation and spies of the image and for dataloes. if you are using this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer open three further options being performed before the photos stored on the disk. if you choose this, the entries can be copied to the IPTC fields in the IPTC fields. with the latest option, you can correct date at time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want to use another file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% 100% S. switch to this option and time you can add the date of time. for more customizations, you should read the help of the report.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you want to use the Camera filename, you can change the option to change the filename in case letters. or in big bookings, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which was used; for a photo is displayed below the name, the camera is stored in a preview. your settings can be saved and automatically, if you open the next time the camera will open the camera.</seg>
<seg id="267">There are all information about the orientation of the camera to take-out, an automatic spin-out during the way. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section side bar metadata, you can find more details about the information that made your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched, and if your camera does not supplies this information, the photo in the original orientation. if you want the automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the fensters.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera was done on the date back to the photo album, it can be loaded to the image. all images are stored on the same day. not all cameras will be available in the same subalbum. in the section side bar meta data, you can read more information about the camera into the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off and in this case, the photos are directly inside the target album. if you want to change this option. use the button extension and select the option Datumsbased on the lower end of the Fensters.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computers on their camera is loading. select the file-up dialog & KDE; you can select the files stored on your camera. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digious; you will be uploaded to the pictures. if you select the desired folder and press OK, please enter the desired folder and press OK. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept for this document. this is meant to be displayed in length and latitude, and can be displayed on a map by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer it can be interesting to use a picture with a precise and quiet place. not everyone is an aircraft to drive through an automated recording of the GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architectural office and real estate makler can be able to use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, you can open this photo by clicking to another & digitization. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitization. if you want to document the site of the photos, it is easy to document or just this aspect, it's good to connect the positional data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first, you should know that there are only three ways to reach it. directly with the right hardware, using a reediting of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical access (manual) and most recently over the manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who work together with GPS receiver. either as a map module or via the transfer of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data can be done by a device with gpsman or GPSBabel. they need to save these data in GPX format, as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from images and of GPS are correlated. on the following page, you can make the same under & Linux; make gpscorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and break-grade or other data, you can use this script which works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the correct coordinates, which are created for example of proteins s.google.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings can be returned back again by using the knocking out of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">These settings can be switched on the standard values. each other pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have only use the option & quot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better starting results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing has a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer another color, you can choose this here. you can use the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underlined areas of a picture can be selected with dark and brighter colour in the picture. this colours can be specified here. in image processing, this enrichment can be switched off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminaires. please refer to this article in Wikipedia are the following statement.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-files you can reduce the size of PNG-files. the only effect is that the image data can be used. if you have a fast calculator, you can put this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 is a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file compressed you can switch the default value of TIFF file for TIFF pictures. this is the size of TIFF pictures. it has no effect on image quality, since the default algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of lossless JPEG-2000 files you can choose loss-free loss. even if you have posted lossworn setting, the ratio was not supported between quality loss and file size. if it was written, metadata were not supported, but it was not included in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digitization; the image processing only worked for photos. currently, it was too fast to create a tool to manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option, if you use this problem with minimal loss of details. this option is a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 gears with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white arrow is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map drawn up in the sun light.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the benefit of the second sensors has the effect that the images can get more details in four steps more details. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-off, so that parts of your images put the top-out white into the settings. in order to solve some unusual results, since it shows the top-lights in various Rosatönen. most recently, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the hairs.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. and dcraw try the lack of green and red shares from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to select the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted individually to each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminance for your taste. however, you have to set him somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be made later in the picture options of the digiosing; however, to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should go conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process in order to detect a complete picture of the data-based image sensor that offers lots of cameras and a matrix-colour pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Farrestructure.</seg>
<seg id="310">There are three alternatives for me: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it produces some of color images that are looking for me. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening, as you will be converted during the raw convertible.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how these again should be given. there are also LCMS and & digitization; for information about the colour space of an colour space in the other, so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Questions, if a picture in image editing is opened / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">You can save the folders such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, which allows you to store all your profiles. & digitization: these folders will then be added during the starter.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles, they have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. all you can change in opening of the crude file, later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or argyll. here are only your images, manages the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be prepared for the same way as Canon, which do not use any color mapping or Gammacorrection factor. currently, dcraw Gamma does not apply for conversions at 16-bit depth. this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, which can be emulate as your image can be given back as your printer, as your printer commands a smaller colour area than your camera and some colors. this could be correct, rather than to leave the blind algorithm in your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">Most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is provided for them. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. unfortunately, a table of cameras and profiles are together fit here. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">Canon profile extension can be seen for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it's an interface to support from a series of & KDE; lots of modules support, which have been written to support with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution installed the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. choose from & digitization. this modules appear as a new entries in the menu of the main fensters and beyond. in addition, you will also see the menu menu of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-orders for tasks, which can be carried out by modules, can be set up in the menu under settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules, you can get over the KIPI project under http: / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diaschau should be easy to understand. the top regulates the time between the screens, normally 4-5 seconds well. the other checkboxes are made in the metadata or, which ends at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the left-hand side of all cameras that are connected to the computer. if you want to make sure that the camera is connected to the computer. if you are connected, the camera switches to be connected, and on the picture settings. currently, you are using the settings, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage devices.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active when you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage devices. you have to specify the path, / mnt / or / mnt / mnt that depend on your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; you have to connect the camera with your computer to display mode in display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Probiere you come out of whether and digitization; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera appears in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any of any word for your camera. this will be displayed in the menu of the main fensters. if you own more than a camera, you can add all the here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of the option dialog for the insert of &gt; images in the garages, you can set the discerning of & digitization; for the solves of a photos in a album set. in the intervals of a photos and deleting of a album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down with and digitization. if you use the changes in the right side bar without back questions. otherwise you need to store the changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also use the display of the welcome screen from & digitization; when subtypes, this accelerates the start process of & digitization under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting up start to new pictures are looking for new photos. this will extend the start time of & digitised; if anything out of the base file was deleted, the digitiner was removed; and if something from the base file is deleted, we'll see if it is out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schematics can be used in & digitization; to choose the main window to your taste. this settings can choose among the design of the tool bar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in simple text files; you'll find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">Digitization: contains a rapid image processing with some base tools. you can use these images to view and enhancing your photos. the image processing can be started using a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the preview and Selection of the entry-file format.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a series of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available in & digitization. so, under circumstances are not part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules you will find in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the lower edge of the fish, the filename, current data number, Entrance factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the upper edge and including the tool for quick access to the most common functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of image processing will change your photos. however, the original photo is changing, before you can use File or the button compatible with the tool you can't use the original photo soon as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should insert a copy of your image, before you change it. you can change your file with your file as perform.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not stored it, you can manufacture the original photo by using the menu file, renditions to the button. you lose any change in the toolbar. you lose any change that you have at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image processing can be re-made and restored and restored. the last action can be back or restored, by combining editing, or be restored by using the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this often, you should use the keyboard-shorter, ctrl; -z to re-end and ctrl; -to replenish.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB in the toolbar or restart button on the tool you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entry, all actions are also made in between and restored and restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same sample, by using the navigation device in the tool. if you are using changes on the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can go to the photo in and out of zooms in which you use Ctrl; Mausrad or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the safer menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can adjust this button in the tool bar: Entrance factor automatically choose</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode the photo is displayed in full screen mode. if you are not interested, you can change this in the settings dialog elements of & digitization. you can call them out of the web press; main window will see the main window.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print your current image, you can choose in the menu file, select the Standard & KDE; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can choose individual pictures or whole sets. all images can choose from your selection. you need to select the images with the default methods and choose from the menu album Export assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The top side is the main window on the right edge, which is important information and actions for the selected pictures. the same sidebar is available without the navigation system, also available in image processing, it will be indicated when one of the five riders will be clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider the side bar appear, and disappear again in the edge of disappear.</seg>
<seg id="355">Please note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used. the labelling is copied into EXIF- and IPTC- fields that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are complete according to 2000 characters and are shaped. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field applications in other applications, you should consider this limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comments, you will either use the button application or change it to the next image, the labelling will then be stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. it is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section evaluation shows a rating of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorrow. it can be used to evaluate a single mouse click on the side street or with the keyboards. in order to evaluate several pictures simultaneously, select these images and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written in the IPTC-box urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sample view shows a search box for filming the keywords, the keyword, and a selection box with the previously published in this & digious; session at the session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is fully adapted to the enable searchlight. you can quickly access the number of opportunities in search for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief at the input of keyboards at a photo series. if you have a variety of keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be stored by marking the appropriate cross-fields in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures are selected in the main view, and you will select a keyword in the keyword, and not on the entire selection, If you want a selection with a keyword, please refer to the paragraph filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidewall filter is used to change the pictures below. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - data, keywords and viewings. if in addition there is a or multiple sample filter from the right side, only the intersection of these two are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also use keywords and put it in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can go out of the right side table and to choose from the selection. then a dialogue, which you ask, whether you want the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window is shown in a calendar day. the keyword filter is chosen on a sample of three images. they have been selected with Ctrl + a, and then a sample from the right keyword is pulled to the selection and there. a dialogue is asking whether this keyword will be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes are held at each Start of the program. it can also be eliminated in settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created that it should be one or should be able to change it with a double click on the text and control section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be a album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument of the Operator, which is a name or a character, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can choose for example a Advanced Search search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want options to use options, you only need the checkbox at the end of the rule and then click the button. the options see then follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr is not listed? the free memory space is limited to 1 GB, and you don't want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. particular thanks to Elle for this work. I have been mainly related to and digitization; for concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you can use a colorable deviation from the camera or scanned colours. in the same way or scanner, you can install the colors on your monitor or scanners of the same or scanners, or the colours that are in the web or in the web.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic on color management would like to know what buttons have to say. unfortunately, the meaning of this tutorial is to provide sufficient background information on color administration. in addition, the links with the lower information allow you to make your own account you will receive the desired results for your own account.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow is fulfilled all six below, then you don't have to take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor's monitor on the sRGB colour space is calibrated. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other major editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is so well working and the life for all so simple, why should you use another colour space and do you need to make your thoughts over the color intensity?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the liqueation of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see the hufeather-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, so please visit Bruce Lindblooms and click on Information and then to info about RGB working groups.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I install my monitor if I decided to work just in the RGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the RGB colour space or not, you need to get your monitor. if you want to work in the color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard kalligator, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. use it, before you try to try out a further manual test.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automatic gearbox and contrast extend out of the menu cords, try to make automatically the best of your colours. they have to have experimenting with these effects to see what's best on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalized: this method scalp the light, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as light as possible without its color shady. this function is often an essential correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Absame: this method uses the same number of pixels. sometimes, the same number is possible to improve the same number of pixels. sometimes, there is a very good results in the improvement of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that is either a miracle done with a picture.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method uses the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright limit of light and adjust the red, green and blue channels on the complete Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the light intensity of the RGB values of a picture through the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a rejiusability of all values in between. this is only visible with balanced pictures and can be good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Paper came from & digitization; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white balance of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The White equals is limited to about a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can occur in case of the original photo, if you can perform the white balance out in the rough mode, which will be in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities are better to be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a Weißabbot Primary of Pawel T. Jochym. you start using the menu entry colors white like the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preset can be adjusted in size. on the left side, the original image can be adapted to the setup of the material. if you want to view the original whitish, then it is enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target company has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel graphics is displayed as vertical line at Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right at the right is a Histogram, however, is very helpful, as soon as you are able to change the parameters, most pixels very small Luminance. with a button, you can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadows is made, you can improve the shadow details of your photos or even down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Scstat with the above mentioned controls, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere you can use the colour temperature for calculating the colour temperature of the White Vision. this species will also be set automatically at the temperature and green values.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The superiority increased the colors, if more than a color channel of pixel error occurs. you'll get the combined result in the White Paper. this is displayed in the preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons store as well as shop is exactly this. every adjustment of the white balance you can set up in a text file, and back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob range, all filter values are back on their standard values and of a neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings are another photo as your original. if you save this store your original file.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the Kodification deep per colour channel. 8-bit coding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. these codes are also necessary for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as well as the editing of colour profiles. it can be used by the underside of color profiles. a detailed guide for use of color profiles can be used as a detailed instructions for use of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available to adjust several color channels at the same time. this tool is helpful if your camera or scanners are always able to use the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual of the visual correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option of exposure problems is corrected the tool to gradation, that you find in colours of gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool colour is provided for you four colour effects, a Solaran effect, a Neon effect and an edge filters available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solaris also called Sabatians, a effect of the image produced. it was the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colours. the result was a partial negative picture of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar control. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image, which is possible to generate a negative output, that's not on photopaper in photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar cell effect. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation, that he has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours and glaring. try it easy to learn more and many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot is made up of daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him to the film's choice for natural photographers. Velvias is strongly saturated and some photographers, especially those of which hardly any landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast carriers. the parameters level controls the brightness of the Neonlichts. with great images the filter can offer the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have any problems with light conditions and the light intensity of your photos. you can view the different colors in the menu. as soon as you are satisfied with the result. as soon as you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you want to get a photo at bad lighting conditions, you can reduce the tool for brightness / saturation and you can view it in the preview. if that's the result you can change the amendments to Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between complex products Gradation and the simple leucine / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on improving the exposure time. even if the dialogue is very complicated, you need to use the application areas only the range of valve. concrete the three shooting down below the Histoprogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a Graphite of intensive values, one Histogram, the active edge as well as the selected area. under the graphs there are three shooting down to change the intensity of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the light areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to shift to shift, and make it possible to pay attention as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, using the settings of the image, updated on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this select box can be displayed if the histogram features a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures the large areas of a constant colour, the linear Histogram is dominated by one single pillar. in this case the logarithmic distribution is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark sounds, the medium sounds, and the lower tones for the medium sounds, often called Gambling values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour tweezers can be used in the preview of the original version to adjust the input of the shade, medium and light sounds automatically. moreover, there is a button for a fully automated alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Payout: the output values are used to change the output values for each area. there are also two buttons to change the output application. the compression of the output can be used, e.g. for example, a light image can be used as background while something different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values will automatically set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save up and store: with these buttons, the introduced values are stored in filesystem, and later again, the Gimp levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you want to use this mode and the three colour pipettes, you want to use the colour pipette, then you want to use the preview of the original value of the door program for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overflow control panel controls all color channels to be transmitted pixels, and you can indicate the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you see an example for the alignment of the input. the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output are unchanged. the original size is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the originals and the target image shown here. the preview will be dynamically on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Upgrade channel: this select box allows the channel to specify the channel by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this cheese, two symbols are possible to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. mostly the linear mode of senare mode produces a broad beams. in this case the logarithmic mode is further developed.</seg>
<seg id="435">When you shift to the right, e.g. the light sounds, the light sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds with darker views and the related image pixels can be darkened.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red waymark. if you want to change this mark, the right line is displayed on the curve. create a point on this line and move it on this line and move the value to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save up and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve that can be stored in filesystem, and later, the file format is stored in the filesystem format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three colour pipettes, you can use the curve for all channels of the shadow, central and sun. enable the colour pipette to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">If in more than one channel overfill monitoring, all colour channels can be found in more than one channel, you'll get the combined result. this is a indicator, meaning you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below, you can see a black-and-white photo that was fixed in the Luminating channel. shadow and Sundays was applied with the paint pipette and it is applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-Mixer of & digitization; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels, or change the color shelling of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel Mixer is a further developed tool to blend the colour shades of pictures. you can view it from the menu colors channel blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel-dial box you can select the color for the Histogram: to correct the channels by using the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the box shows you a preview of The original can be seen as a result of the own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the objective features a red marker. if you read this in the image, vertical line will appear in the Histogram, to give you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls are set right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to modify the option of Monochrome, because the channel blender will then be able to generate this tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you come Monochrome, which comes from a little noise, which can still occur in every channel. if the case is differently, you can improve your Monochrome conversion so that you can reduce the colour space.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and store buttons are precisely for this purpose. any blender setup can be back later and then invite you to save. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overflow control panel controls all color channels to be transmitted pixels, and you can indicate the combined result of all channels. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final results.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below, you can see a photo shown in the blue channel. the option Luminance is activated. the original version is under (1) and the beware picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstracts. with the development of the digital photography, black / white work is step, as colour images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film screenings.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filters. it looks good to portraits in all sceneries and plays a very good portrait against the sky. therefore, like the 004 Cokin (tm) green filters.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filters. it improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orgeFilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotate: simulates a black / white film screenings with a red lens filters. this creates a dramatic watch effects and can simulate moon lists to the day. so, like the 003 Cokin (tm) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">White filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filters. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 Cokin (tm).</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates hot light and medium sounds when he add a bit cold in the scandal. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and this is similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digitization; tool Texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting, a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: drive this parameter to the right increases the depth of depth and three-dimensional texture to the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original version is (1) and changed under (2). the parameter relief is set on 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digitization; tool frame can add a decorative frame in order to be added.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer came into the borders of a photos. this is a psychological barrier to set the picture. this is a psychological barrier to be set. under the picture frame, the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, fill the picture with a colored line, niepce converted it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white pictures), emulating it with a nice three-dimensional frame as well as decoration.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of the images, especially if you have used the tool for the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add simple formatted text in an image to any time. this goes even in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is easy to use and place it with the mouse. use the text size, orientation, colour from the colour space and the character set. if you need the picture, the larger must be the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting which can be chosen for your text, can be changed to the knob "OK." after the picture once was saved, the text is part of the image. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digitization; tool mold, you can apply a template about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu item Schablone can be used in image processing, to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">There are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. if you want to add your templates (9). if you want to add your templates, please send an e-mail in English to take delivery of the digitization; mailing list digitization @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you want to use this tool, you must select your template-file with the knob-file in the dialogue. select the folders in which you get the template-files. these settings are required for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root committee for the template has been set out of a building view, which is reprinted on the Regulatory structure of the Schablel's file. the selection of a Ordway is updated and reviewing the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons for you to change the Entrance factor and change the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button becomes the lower picture. it is used around the position of mouse, check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Discerning: this button clamping in the mouse picture. if you want the template for the mouse, if you want the template on the whole image, you must use the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Sent out this button to shift the picture below the template. take the picture and put it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want the templates on your image. the image will then be adapted to the preamp size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tool for sharpness. each of you have advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpenes is a traditional tool for sharpness. it's very fast and simple, but especially in dark areas, approved pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness-Maske works on the contrast of edges. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychological Dunst and it makes it a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and he is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is probably the best of the three, because he really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitised images need a common color. this is the same phenomenon which can be printed in a common color. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more continuously than normal cameras for the private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, JPEG images often have been applied to the camera. pictures in the raw materials must always be shot during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are able to use a sharpness already during the read of the image. if you disable this, you will receive your image over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain usable, by clicking a photo with sharpening-throwing cuttering. you can connect to the menu entry to conducting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should make sure that the results are not very natural: the sharpness of a picture increases the edge of the edges, but it's the tool to focus a picture on the menu. you can find more information about the menu entry. you'll find more information and a comparison of all techniques.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crispy. use the tool to add a bit soft as it. use the tool to add cornerstones with the menu on the right side of the dialogy show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskets is a very good tool to remove it from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original photo and the preview we help the picture. the predatschster shows the edition of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often tried out. an increase in the radius or the amount of the amount is going to make the effect. if you make the untighter mask, you'll be able to create and generate the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is a like many pixels on each side of the filter affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiators. they should be more accurate images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the spoiled image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and a difference between the maximum amount of filter. thus, this way can be used with a soft change between the tones of visual acuity and hence flaw error in core, Himmler and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the beating picture (2). not sharp masked with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digitization; tool refocus is focused on a picture of improving the sharpness. it used the urging protected protected filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to achieve a picture at & quot; refocus on a photo. it is using a technique as easy to try. it is usually better outcomes than unsharp masked. you can start it out of the menu by using colours refocus in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular form is much better than the palate. the palate is going far away from the source pix. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gaul'schen Filling is affected in most cases, even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular ring. it is the most important parameters for use this module. the default value is 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very sharp, but if your image should be very sharp on holy.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: the correlation can help produce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. Brauchable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the toughest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">To help speed filters can help speed up to 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 becomes the image quality very poorly. a convenient value is 0.03. a high value is still remaining.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gaudi's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter to 0. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid digestible Artefacts. if you are able to use a value zero, you may have to increase the correlation between correlation and / or oderm.</seg>
<seg id="503">Mat size: this value is determined by the size of the transformer, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. however, note that the module will select great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storage as and store buttons will be used exactly to this purpose. any process focus is set, so that it will be stored for later and then can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all train cutting, color and intensive courses on the picture before you use the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module, before you change the image, before you change the picture, but the reason is that much operations changes are not visible immediately, but later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp results produces better results as a sharpness. this could be caused by the sharp maskets to be used as a sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it must be used to remove the effect. even under optimum conditions it may be possible to remove the optimum Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese Filters always be at least as good as the toughness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better than the editing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between the different filters, displayed on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image can be corrected. this image has been done with a analog camera. the invisible result is due to unsufficient light to the car focus.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods to sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulators, the untightening of the area has been removed, in order to create a natural pill of natural pill.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinktur enables a adapted color for the pill. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image is one of the most widely developed tool to remove the desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different memory settings as a Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider Getting and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Details envisors [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. however, a small value leads mainly homogeneous areas. if a value of 0,9 should obtain more details. please note that there is no sharpness to be needed. please note that the details of the direction would always be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="520">The value of response to Alpha [0,100]: a small value of only in all directions; and if you have a film liquor or CCD Rauschen, a high value of plastic patterns. JPEG Artefacts are given the best at a value near to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum Glättation factor above allying. then put these value for the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies larger structures. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbine effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: is going to run as often the algorithm used. usually, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle distances da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropia alpha. if alpha is too small, should be too small to make sure small angle may generate a long time. so, you should select this value so as possible and needs your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrators [0.1, 10]: integral parts in pixel pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel genes and never should never be larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More on quality you get through the selection of this option is only low. it doubled but the term. we recommend him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons storing and store exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very quickly with the work. however, it can still take a long time, and a high CPU load will take place. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the knock.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can remove how image errors can be corrected with a analogue camera. as you see, there is a stand-like species in the foreground that was caused by a bad film storage during the trip (The original version is below (1) and corrected the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization is a very powerful tool to reduce its base. it uses a troduction of protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool selectable image filters are available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair in the lens. it can also be used to remove the sensor from the camera or moirees; effects of injected images from books and magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor-cameras from digital cameras, you can read this in this tutorial to this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">This screen photo above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a non-smoking space that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the lower window, the settings can remain in standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius will be used to filter the filter size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used to filter the filter per pixel, and the image can be moved through the radius and the color in him will be dimmed and therefore smaller error occurs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness is sharpness. if it increases the pixel distance to be removed. if you need to adjust the edges, you may need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can't get more and lubricating or lubricating or lubricating or lubricating.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or stored tips, and you can remove it to a value near the maximum level, if you want to remove a guarded Rauschen or JPEG Artefacts without details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or lightness, to improve a picture. these settings affect no less catches that will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or lightness, to improve a picture. these settings affect no less catches that will be controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger, however, even the shadow fields.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the phase radius on variations. if it is increased, the edges can occur when he is able to occur. if he will occur on the edges, Rauschen and phase jitter can occur on the edges. it can be noise and is the recommended method.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons can be used precisely for this buttons. all parameters to be saved, which you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how to change your life can change your life. the original size is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the tank was used with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes it is a picture to draw for your purpose. do not use a bit soft as a picture. use the tool to add cornerstones with the menu entry, and experimented with the rest of the dialogy. the effect on the right side of the dialogy shows the effect of this surgery on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & contents came; photo restration is definitely one of the most developed tools around photo arteface.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you a lot of undesious artefacts of your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove the photography, original or subsequent digitally digitally images to remove. the puff takes place along the image and receives the contents of the human eye as it makes human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturing. the algorithm for restoring is carried out by the IMAGE team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkrich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artability record: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas of them. when a low-loss of compression has produced some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this adjustment should be corrected this problem.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as well as shop is exactly this. each setting of photography restoration can be stored in a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restration is comparatively very quickly with the work. however, it can still take a long time, and a high CPU load will take place. therefore, you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can see how a photo with equine Rauschen.. The module is supported on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film experience on the core. the original image is below (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see a further example for the photography restoration. this time textures can be used on an old color photo that has been used with a scepaper screen. the original image can be seen from the scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and corrected the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool Hotpixel allows them to remove it into a CCD camera to remove from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode, because many cameras with JPEG compression on a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; and" quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraps. there is no manual method to select the poor pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with the button image. the tool will be able to recognize the hot and bright pixels. this will be highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to explore the dark-set directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD-defect.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching darker image. an automatic processing of dark image becomes the bad pixels. note that the assistant is the last dark-image, and this automatically invites you to the next meeting again.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image range and the preview will help you correct within the image. predatschster shows the issue of filters with the current settings. bad pixels are in all predictive areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixel blocks. these are available for filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is an average of the neighboring villages. the resulting colour is assigned to all defective pixels in block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels is calculated by a distance of 1 pixel block on the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). this will be used to cross the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block was to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) to calculate the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, and the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the correct image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitization; Vignetination correction is a tool to correct the Vignetop, i.e., undercut corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle objects, in particular in the middle and large photo format, often the entire sensor range is not evenly illuminated. instead & quot; vignetenquot; (shaded) they reach the corners and edges in the image by setting the light to the sensor. Teleobjects can also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it does not require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperting filter, which is necessary to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle objects should also be used, even with center filter, a opening of f / 16 or less, because otherwise untightening effects arise.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter transformation through this filter and is used to simulate the transformation with a Centerfilter. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the Vignetera correction filters, and three other exposure of the target.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter is controlled by the highest density at the point of the highest density. the standard density is 2.0, or randomly to compensate for an optic disc size from 1, or randomly to compensate for a larger degree of Vignettation, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: do not need to adjust the value of the image by using these options. you need to adjust the exposure of the target product using these options. the pressure regulates you only positive values, since you need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to upgrade the exposure of exposure to the target, let the values for illumination / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitization; image processing of the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetree correction for an image. the original image (1) shows the corrected image. a luminaires and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitization: lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a legally binding algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric notes. colorings can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second Grades deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concreave form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar round effect, however, is applied to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth Grades corrected the remote edges in the second ridge. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated nearly eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion in the second Grades. with negative values, tongs can be corrected and positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value is controlled by the strength of the distortion. this value acts stronger at the edges as in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'corners parameters the symbol of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value added the image size and leads a correction of the first gradation by. negative values also increase the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you the best filter settings, illustrated the slide with a preview of devaluation correction factor. the values can be used for your image, and are stored in the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tongs - or kisseng correction should be carried out prior to all train - or dimensions of changes. if you need to cut this correction than all the first. if you need a picture of new correctally and afterwards a tonally-like correction would be the effect of the Falsche.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you the best corrections for you. move the mouse to be fixed in your image, and press the left mouse button to fixed the lines at this site. furthermore, you can connect the tongs / kiscation-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a kiscation-shaped distortion, the resulting pic of black corners. you can remove this with the cutting-cutting tool in the menu and remove the image processing or via the zoom regulator to this dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step is sufficient for the images. the next logical step for some motifs, as well as recordings from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective at the picture 90 degrees. please note that when you hold the camera with the hand, you will always hold a slight dip in the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tongs-shaped correction is applied to a church in Norway. the original version is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulate infra-infra film of the Gimpbelt film. the filter remanufactured by the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Itherrarotmovie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the box, you can select the range for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters to simulate a high sensitivity of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film and dominance of the color green (Chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white and snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels are used to produce infra-red film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs since the color is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-filming effect on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original photo is under (1) and the beet picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of Aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digitization is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce films on your images. this is well known from classical high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturer of large silver patrons of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">Your photo shows a certain mood or seem to be back in the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grainy, especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated by the intensity and granularity of Körner. the default value is higher, even higher values are needed to be set on ISO-2400. if you need more body, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filmic effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the beating (2). the used film sensitivity equal to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a cross-legal algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization; filter oil painting gives your digital images showing a nice appearance like a oil painting. natural pictures and styles are well suited for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two buttons to influence this effect. the top is the pinout size between one and five out of. thiere brush paints better for big images. smooth, or, from the other side from the side of the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is characterized by the (1) and the beating is marked with (2). brush size for this 640-pixel large picture is 1 and puff 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The addition of the digitization: filter coal drawing is used to create a coal outlet. therefore, pictures of their gradients are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine that scene you would have chosen to skip yourself. this would be good pictures to begin.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control these effect. the upper knocking out the pin size from and the lower adjust the contrast (gentleman).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal tank filter. the original image (1) and modified image (2). the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity level.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digitization: filter engraving defines your image in 3-D, when it was marked in wax. it uses a legally binding algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious, filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important content. the filter used the differences between color and intensity to turn the picture into a grey, monochrome landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the beware picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can use a normal photo in a work of art by using the distortion effects. it uses this to be protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in cells and can look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelength 1, the picture here comes with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can break these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can use a normal photo in a artwork by unsharp-effects. it is used to be protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: swiss the picture along sternal lines from a centre run. this simulates the toughest camera and generates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpness: swiss the picture by turning of the pixel to a center. this simulates the toughness of a camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: swiss the image around the effect of a non-focused camerinse. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement untighter: knowing the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the toughness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train ride, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft brains: swiss the image is soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dream and shiny focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtils.</seg>
<seg id="620">Contactless sharpness: swiss the image by random compositional pixels, thereby simulates the toughness of a non-moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unsharpness: finds the colour's pool in the picture and swiss these without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and creates it, through the filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make Regentropes on your image. as a result, it gives a natural picture of your pictures. it is used by Pieter Voloshyn urged protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the image. since the trophy is not automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick to the digitization; image processing is free of shelf-free. use the range tool to choose for example a face, that is free to choose. if you restart the filter Regentropes, the area will remain free from Regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf filesystem. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the beware picture (2) indicates a sunset on a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo is the wrong orientation, you can bring it by spies or rotation into the correct orientation. the tools can be transforming and transforming them to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blocks definitely one of the most widely developed tools in order to get a photo to enlarge at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is simple, as you can see a picture of a picture and the details of the resolution? how can you be used in a picture, you can find out more information or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here, makes a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a picture is the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialogue is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool used for size is a linear interpolation method to match the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to fblender.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many education programs use a type of interpolation, i.e. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. the underlying algorithm used by the IMAGE Team of GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to say the tool like you want the size of the size. these settings are available in the Reiter New size:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the input of the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter applies larger structures. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbine effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons can be saved as and store exactly. each stallage for photo, can be stored as a text file and later will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo slice is very fast in what it makes, but it can still take a long time, and a high CPU load will go after. you can break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">Below, you can see below for photography by a small color picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard counter.</seg>
<seg id="640">The feed of one photo is not only a common operation, but also a picture of a picture, you need to move the right to mouse, using the mouse button, pressing the mouse button, and create a rectangle, then you'll see this right, while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, you will cut off the area. thereby, you can change the size of the turning area, by turning the size of the rectangle, by making a new rectangle using it simply with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are pleased with you, use the button The Zucutting de button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut down (Ctrl; + X). use the file again and file sharing in the menu file to save the new picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preamp area, you can change the size of the rectangle by setting the corners with mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in the dialogue, stays in the dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the mould with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format area. in the high format, the larger value of height and cross-format width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is used to reduce the aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogy, two buttons provide automatically horizontally horizontally and vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below for the dialog, you can set the area with the Max. ratio button to access to the largest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool with the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation of orientation. the default image can be stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data can be rediscovered in the EXIF tables, and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of merging aid will enable them to make your images better and put your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious participations are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-paragus, harmonic triangles are the possibility to share a similar to harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which is based on different natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussels, or the bubble on a sunflower. it is mentioned in all possible things to find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and it has been used by the old Egyptians and the pyramids. artists and architects have been used in all times when you use your pictures, buildings and even photos put together to give your creations for a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is directed by the Fibonacci result 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to 1: 1.618 the golden center. one composition the composition is considered as a visual harmonically.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid aid lines, if you are able to set up a picture. this help are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral allows you to get your destination for your photos. in comparison to the third paragus, the golden spiral can follow the eye. this kind of composition carries out the viewer's viewing along the line of Spirale and abolished in this kind a symmetric visual River.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right corner of the golden spiral, too. it should be something that the eye can be turned into the centre of composition. this can be a line of or different objects. this is just because the eye can be traded without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also available from the top. its failure rates are the middle of the sides of the golden triangles, a golden triangles of the same triangles. diagonal to these lines can be used in diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to set up your frame. try your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information into the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you can't reach it otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal-mirror and vertical scale can be used to reflect the harmonic submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. to this type, you can adjust the colour of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free web press is a tool to turn a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to get off the camera to get a angle. you can use this with the digitization; image editing and the tool free press. select transforming free press and adjust the target angles.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the shooting angles. you can set the shooting down to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right hand side of the box. the new dimensions of the image can be displayed right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the module is free of a horizontal line and vertical line. move the mouse to appear on an important point of image, you can fixed him with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have a picture, you will find triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to repair the function transforming part of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cutting the picture is cutting edge. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing glassé the picture is a bit after the rotation. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All Peruvian transformations are carried out around a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image, and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically re-calculated automatically on the right-hand side of the dialogy. you will find some information which you can help you:</seg>
<seg id="670">New latitude: the width of the new image, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation are made in pixel.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation are made in pixel.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transforming area.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the adjustment of the perspective, the image becomes somewhat less. for an individual adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've got the perspective, you get a good triangular holes at the corners. a possibility of view is to be connected to the image with transforming part of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">This module is used to move towards a part of the image in one direction and the lower part to the left. this is no threshing, the image will be confused. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transforming.</seg>
<seg id="679">Skate your picture by adding the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you can set the angle to zero, the angle to zero is displayed. a preview of the effect will be displayed and displayed the new dimensions of the target file's right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help you get a vertical and horizontal line. move the mouse to one important point, e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fixed the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the image, the image will have a bit swiss. for a single lubrication, this effect is typically negligible, but two couches have twice as much as devastation and therefore, you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After lubrication, the image has an unusual triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate it, it is the image with transforming cut into the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">There are a number of libraries and other packages available to read image formats. therefore, the types depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type, such as these libraries were compelled. in most distribution, you can see a large number of screens with & contents.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give you a list of all available file formats. they always will always be JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">There are only files in formats to know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this list. if the extension is shown in image processing, you can change these list of file extensions. you may change these list of file extensions. in the section, you will find further information about this page.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to choose to choose format. a detailed description of this file formats you can find in Wikipedia. & digitization supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedure for digital image. thereby redundant information are reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general there is better, smooth results as JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also save loss-free when this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read in English on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge. you can convert raw images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw material Converter. in the section, you will find further information about the use of modules with & digitization.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digitization; supported the game of rough pictures only with the program dcraw, which are supported in & digious. all cameras can be seen below the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw materials that came from & contents.</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording short films. however, these clips are often used in the AVI- or MPEG-format. but if you have no built-in films. if you want to display any film file, download & digitization; the & KDE; settings to playback films are used to start playing the program.</seg>

<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so you can use the contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switches does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the convergence rates. the filename stays and only adapted to the extension. JPEG uses a loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you want to use your pictures or later, you don't use the JPEG format, as it is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to maintain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata will be stored in the RAW file in the Exif-information stored in the Exif-information.</seg>

Find out more</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages you have to create some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each section is available.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, give the titles of the overclock and a description, which should contain HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML Example pages, you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you choose whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created on the overview page. nutritional information about the export files will be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select that information can be displayed on the HTML pages. so you can consider that the pictures from a party are obvious, so all the pictures of the same images are exported. therefore, you can not use this setting, so that the images can not apply to certain pictures before a certain way.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this field you can look back, like the HTML pages are supposed to look like HTML pages. most of them are clearly visible, which is not specially established in this case.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the side you can choose various resolutions for the pictures. thus, those have to look at the site and monitor a monitor which have the maximum resolution 800x600, which have no images for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">On your site, the viewer can change at any time, it can change your images with low resolution, as well as to a lower transmission time, as well. if he would like to get a picture larger, he would like to get to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you put the various folders and the URL will be stored where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At the best, you select a basic file for your HTML files and a new subfile for each successive sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be stored. this folders will be stored in the next time. by this, you can select either a file or one of KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures if you have created a URL. if you have created a URL, the URL is started. the URL, which you should be fixed here, should be this file. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong file.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the final destination, you don't have to copy it manually in the final destination. this means that the import function, see, right, you need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfile of the files, but the basic file will be found in the subordner.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described features can be found all three on basic file and URLs. in these, a subordner is laid out, whose name is set in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you come to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbums, you can get to create a HTML site. however, you can add your pictures on the images, place, etc., then you have to make sure you have to do with & kphotoalbums; this work will not even be able to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbums, you can export one copy of your pics into a .kim file. you can import other objects in your database. the image characteristics are added with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin -files, internal and external. it can be stored in the file, or if you are able to store them in the file, that you can set all pictures together, and this file is so irrespective of this file. however, the obvious result is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file, together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">If you are looking for an external .kim file, the pictures are not found in the file. at first, the pictures of the URL will search for HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML exports.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue is described by the dialogue, which you can find via the menu file... Find out more.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogues is to act as it should be in internal or external .kim files. the following three selection options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If an option is done in the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same file as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the proximity of the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbums; the pictures are automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">Normal Zip files are normal Zip files. as most pictures already were compressed, and the XML file is very small, it is normally not enough to compress the files. if you want to use this, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is Maximale image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, because the .kim file is otherwise very big. here you can say the size of the size, for example, that each picture can be up at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the encoded .kim from the web browser or from the menu file, select & kphotoalbums, which are exported to the database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to imporatory is made up of four steps. first you need to select what images you want to import, then, in which file the import pictures should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you can use the category persons of your application file (if you are a Danish e), while this category is required for your database. that's why in the third dialogwindow, the categories should be imported to import, and which are to be used in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can use the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this you see on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to look at and view: if you see images, you want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday. if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday, you would like to discover all images that this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) fixed the information about your images, (2) the search and renown, up to (3) advanced topics and adjustment possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to transfer your pictures. it has been expanded and now also care of your videos. at many places in this manual, more pictures are spoken, but often with videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its pictures in the file index.xml. it is a simple XML file, which you like to install a program of your choice, e.g. standardised safety tools, copying on a diskette or revisions in the CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">If you're talking about your files stored in future starter album; if you want to read a different database in & kphotoalbums, so if you want to start with a different file album. if you want to start with the option -c. as Example: kphotoalbums -c ~ / Company / Image / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings, you book... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbums; change in the following section of the user's message, you will be explained in various settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, which you can call for the viewer's options and options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help you can call for a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you like for each of each picture, for example, persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialogue, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can choose a labelling field and a symbol of the icon.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were mentioned above. in the dialogue, you can book full member groups, i.e. all members of a group on once in a group set, instead of all groups of a Mittglider as stated.</seg>
<seg id="956">You can see the options of a member of the member sections. with the above selection list, you can select the category. in the left side of the list, you can select a list with the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; he shares the modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modulus system is KIPI and means & KDE; image plugin interface. nutritional information you find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the modules and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbums, but are not sold separately. however, most modules have any help you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules in multiple applications can be used together with the demo database, so you can test it on your own images. so, you should check out the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or more about the menu. do not say, I don't believe it!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications which use the modules more than KIPI common, are very different, making it a few modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside when you're using various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The greatest difference between & kphotoalbums; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is an album simply plugging in-out albums; this kind of order is not supported, simulated it for some modules the order to albums out, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbums.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulated & kphotoalbums; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbums, there is still a list of albums were handed over. here's & kphotoalbums, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser needs the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you have set up in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums, so if you're using the category persons, if you have selected persons, so if you have chosen persons for the view and the module do this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since there are some modules with & kphotoalbums; not compatible, you can remove these from the modules from the modules. start the settings dialog, and select the modules in the modules, which modules are loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example for a starting screen, as soon as you & kphotoalbums, start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you can find quite a lot of information, as you can't have any information about your images. in the section we will come back to this window, but then just click here to watch the images that shows you an overview of all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the most important functions of & kphotoalbums, is the possibility to see each picture with notes. so, you can find any image either individually or for a larger number of images certain remarks at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures of Jesper, and all images included in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browser like you can read in the section. if you want to see this comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can look three lists with a text box by giving people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbums; since you can always use it back, if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the list below: if you have a family celebrations and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people can be printed, so you can find that the names used for above, the people can be moved faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer a alphabetical list, click on the symbol for sorrow to your list under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have a remarks on each picture, you might need to view all the selected pictures and pictures with notes. click in this case easily and back-buttons, which are on the right side of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark these pictures, and the menu item multi-level entries can be equipped with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and California lie all in the USA. they are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window of the United States as an overview. to indicate that there is a special symbol appears to show a special symbol.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment menu made it possible to add a entry into an existing or new monitoring category. in addition, you can also make an entry for this category to make this entry into a sub-category. attention, this sets out that you just use your categories in alphabetical menu.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone of the individual elements of the note dialogs by putting the bodies that form the upper side of the frame, and shift it. you can make a window into a window by putting him outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you are looking to meet the look at your needs with the settings, click on the button options, click the button options..., which offers you the possibility of store the current structure and the appearance of the Fensters.</seg>

<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the pictures are available, so you can see the preview of these images. however, you can also view these images with the picture viewing.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function takes you to copy files from the files and copy it. if you want, even if you want to avoid each other to your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want a little more privacy you want to be able to watch other unaccessible menu. alternatively, you can also see all the images showing your little sister, check out and select the menu entry for more than current view.</seg>

<seg id="1045">Supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive; recursively, because every Pixel is still further split, and adapted to the records of the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, trams POV-Ray can be determined using super-sampling rates. if you choose the depth of a specific number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculates the depth of a specific number of pixel, an extra-volume of 4x4 points will be charged with a depth of 5 by 5x5 (25) additional rays each pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first Pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixels. if the difference between the color values are specified, the pixels is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be followed separately on further underlines. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another chance to reduce the aliasing effect, is the creation of smokers for the Strahl's process, called Jittering. if you turn off at Jittering, & Povray sets the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setup for quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is a experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light rereflection is calculated. it takes a long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this box map, you can adjust if the alpha-channels are calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is transparent, if the associated beams are not made.</seg>
<seg id="1053">A new window for viewing the & Povray; -consolation Edition. if & Povray is finished, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file imports... and choose from the dialogistics one file.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler is currently supported and not the complete command of & Povray; however, if the impacting error messages or warnings will demonstrate a dialogue window of all the messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't support source code in & kpovmodeler; write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">Objects from object tree into the editor to export the source code for & Povray; an editor. to import objects into the scene. in order to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in editor and drag him in the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With Kopats and Simply in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also add source code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene is broken. usually this POVRAY or x-POVRAY.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the Details view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the selected object. set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example: alfelddaten) in the pins of the scene you must also bear the path to these files. if a file is found in different thread of the library, the first spotted file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used to display the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for the display of the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visible field in the camera view and into the window-type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object of the points to the Raster in the context menu of the wireless model. you can set up the Raster separately for shifts, scaling and turning.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values have a more accurate image model and thus better nails for the required objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects, such as ball can be set up the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you're talking to a detailed projections for advanced projections, all wireless projections are used. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections. this feature is a better approach for projections, requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you bet a wall, a wall behind the objects. the wall is depicted in a chess box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you ignore ground, a floor is below the objects. the floor is shown in a chess set pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you decide to dissolve the non-recursive antialiasing method for renders of the scenes, you can adjust the values for depth and swelling. you can find more accurate data to the parameters you find in the Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can create existing window orders or new window orders. in the section window orders will create, how you can create windows and store.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination of the standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of the window system shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to add the button to add and create a select arrangement with the button removing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name; the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order. new views can add to the button to add and selected views with the button removing.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new Fensters. with a new column, you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with a carton card with the previous view and set the view, the view is not on the main window, but this creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you've just started & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; and if you follow all steps in this guide, you should follow the ultimate but simple scene you may very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings, before you complain that you will only receive a black screen. if you are using a 3D program, you should consider this important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for renders can be applied as a result, you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you add any light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultlessly installed, you see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">They take a little time to learn the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation, so you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You'll need to use these menus and symbols, so should you use the menus and symbols and use their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you'll need to remove all objects from object tree. mark the scene and select the menu entry, you'll have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks like the camera. in particular note the scene of the camera's fourth wire model (right below). this is the view of the scene from the camera. this is the result of the Renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree contains a new record with the name camera. if you click on, see the content of the camera's view, to which the different parameters can be found. in the user documentation, & Povray will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is the following lines, but also notice that the camera can change the camera to change the camera. click easily with the left mouse button to a control point and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or modify the input button, the wireless model and object sizes are immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the bottom for the scene. you could add a quake (introductory body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a smooth method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; indeed, actually an easy way to use. you can also use a infinite plain as bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in object tree, change the name, and press the button application or pressing the button. in object tree the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model shows now the level also shows the level, if also at the moment only as limited level. if you renched the scene, the level rises to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you click the object of object right, you'll find the number of object for the floor as you click on the icon +. in this case you can find the standard options for each new object: scaling, threshing and delay. select one of these options, also modify the possible settings in the view of object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should change the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just trying to get some of these parameters, select the delay and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Choose from the ground to set his material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little bit of materials.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue may choose which you can choose from object's object. please select the name in the object's object (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment contains only a matt black material, because you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on you. now give you the colors for the pigment. but instead there are many possibilities, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see a color on quader and ball, click here to the button application and call the preview site.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correct. if you like your image now with a click on the symbol renders, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course there are not the colors necessary. in the color list, you'll need to use two new attributes. in the color list, you can also use this entry twice (you can also do this, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colours):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object of baum, select the colors in the view of object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be run simply run as you can simply run the fundamental work of & kpovmodeler; even if the ball may be just as easy as the bottom:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for your radius: 1 (don't forget to press the input or button application), so that the ball would break off the ground, as you would have moved to the ground by a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, Renders are now a strange result: as previously mentioned before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. set in the following step, a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now have a material. as soon as at bottom, you enter the ball of pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">If you choose the ability and change the name for example in ball pigment. click the pigment, then select the color and make the values like follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can gain more interesting effects, if you take the time, some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings are Glanz effect and reflection in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal is not selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of it, what the opportunities you & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have already learned how much, which you can create simple, but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraytracing is a Pinot method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene, hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, reflects the scenes) of any pixels in the scene, and the visual effects of light sources in the scene, like atmospheric effects, such as nebula. thus, the scene pixels for pixels was processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see without any camera, you'll see the camera. without a light source you can't see the picture, it's simple black. obviously, any scene you need to be rounded, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. POVRAY file usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog, you can select a file, which you have previously prepared with & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model, it will add the file into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model already, it will be stored under the same name. it is a new file, you must enter a name and a storage place.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A dump map is a possibility to be screwed on surface surfaces, without any Beule on the surface to be modeled and without the geometrical shape of the lens itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms which are used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. this models will be processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & KDE; applications also, with a & DCOP; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; -interface. with the help of this interface, parts can be controlled via a shellscript.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical, therefore, rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial, which will give you the pre-confirmation programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to make sure you have to make sure that & k3b have to make sure that & k3b is started. then you will give something like the following line:</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject (using this reference is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface).</seg>

<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString Quartet, QString Quartet) void removeItem (QString Quartet, Qstring newname) void seteID (QString Quartet) void seteID (QString Quartet)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script is a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createx $PROJECT createFolder test / foo dcop $PROJECT addadl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1498">For the first step, the check out of & CD;, is used by & kaudianoia. almost each distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coefficiencies are already available, but there is no longer necessary to compile it. however, if FLAC must not be used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">The co-file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer has a small introduction via Kodierer, Audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to head of protected audio CD; as it has been said, uses & D data; therefore it is not possible to use an protected audio CD; if it is not possible to use any audio CD; even in any case you can use the mechanisms of copiprotection. avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup fee has to be done only once (the setup dialogue), the daily approach to read a & CD; on the hard disk. this leads to understanding for the slender approach of the user interface, which you will start in the start often.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter illustrates sound quality, codierer and compression rates and helps you with the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. apart from FLAC there are other such as' sharks' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution and hardly available commercial devices to play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">According to audio formats, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG can now have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but they are less important than that they are very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distribution as free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-audio systems. today - early 2009 - these devices are usually only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A quick list of parameters to audio quality and the resulting press rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting takes good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titanium. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titanium. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and Autostereotives. but not good enough for better stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most of the environments, but if you need to use the absolutely highest quality without backview to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; Information, the manual is included or by the program automatically from the freedb program, are available as a list of parameter settings. you can be used with & kaudioa; and the coordinating program to create files and file names as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with co-programmes, there are often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters. the manual or the help to the coordinators explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD (english: day) to add MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiobe added; the result looks like: '-tt {prize}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioiler; parameters that can be used (= button code name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is available: a free database can be found in the people, so that all other information can be downloaded into the computers. it's note that you can only talk about text: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legally binding, but I'm not a lawyer. however, there is no matter that you are on & CD; therefore, there is no more or less valuable, so it may not be added to the music of the music. all the information can be added in a bummel by a & CD; shop, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioble; if the use of freedb address can be used as the system used in this type. in this kind of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address can't be used by the server (this can only know the programming code aware of the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries to use the main database. if & kaudioga is set to use freedb, the geographically on the next flying mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and counters the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org delivers a current list of Reflections for the online call of & CD; information about how to read a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually year monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The readout program is used to save pieces out of the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumors that this cdparanoia will be used; if you want to know more, search in source code... This was the best choice for the read of audio CDs. see the note that the cdparanoia package from the matching distribution must first be installed, if this is not done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing your wav-files, the Kodierer and the desired file format can be selected. during the first opening are defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (lossless compression) on the Registercard. other comers can be added on this Registercard.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution, before Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined Kodierer. more information about Kodierer are located in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a coop you can get further information about its switch as lame -help or lame --help in a consolete window (eg; console). however, 'lame' must be replaced by the installed chamber.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have a lot of causes. check the device of the device naming of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. what could give a hint regarding what is false.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not check a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; and this is not gelingen!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is an chapter with a step for example. even if you use other settings, tips can give you how to go.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, however, there are still uncertain what is? well, there is no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to prepare those areas, which you want to make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all set up and our first & CD; read lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyboards (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packets for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd / cd</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with basic set of & kaudioa; something that is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD; what must be repeated for every single & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here, we determine the sound quality of music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 - 256 kbps). since we are lazy. since we are lazy, we share the program with that the freedb will be able to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will not be able to change it with each set of one & CD; change if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The equipment designation will be given to the readout program, so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the real device name. if you can't work with other programs, the drive can be given to the / etc / fstab file, and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card of General Settings. here you don't have much to do. here, an additional conversion is defined. in our example, everything will be shown in such as in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only add unfull information if you ask, so that you are informed about the creation of keyboards (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -settings. simply can select both entries. we are comfortable and let the disc. you can download and download the Internet from a freedb computers.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator has to be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the internet, so he can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simple, if you are not satisfied with the database entry, or one day entries you can easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with conscriptions - &gt; umbename and ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; meetings.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example is further notice: if you want to download it in offline mode, if you want to use everything in offline mode, if you need to use it twice. in order to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields will be chosen, at least the first mode of mode is set up at the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is intended for us freedb. this is the settings for us on the Internet. how do the system that will get the CD on the Internet. read the section via freedb. put everything as it is shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we are not downloaded the database not only, we want to work with the web database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go on to Friedb.org and look after a mirror server in your vicinity. this way the load will be distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work is equivalent to the server, as many firewalls allow the protocol 8880 standard by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; data on the freedb server. the first checkbox should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings on screen photo. (make sure that the folders / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces in the same time: excuse, there is a reason why more than one at the same time at just one existing drive? paralleles reading and co-code? the author knows it, that's easy to try itself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after aligning the last piece, cross it to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined files for temporary files: if you can be saved, if you need to be stored on a different drive, the field is not included in a private folders. if you don't forget this file, if you want to make a bit with WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything so type like it is on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances must be shaken anything to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned earlier, this increase bit rate is sufficient for almost 224 - 256 kpbs. which reached the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation. Kid3 is an excellent 'ID3' Tagger for & KDE; in the case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables on the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore, or even a multi-processor machine, more than a WAV file can be encoded at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic equipment of & kaudiovia. this configuration is used as standard for each package of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music wise, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described, as the process of readout of the music is described, as we are comfortable and set up. first, you will find a link to the internet, as we are comfortable and the CD; data from the freedb will be described above. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for each use and CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we do not contain a & CD; it's not enough to be seen as a CD; with successfully from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data on the Internet you can pick up from the internet. comments on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try to find out the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done, so now the & CD must be defined in the drive, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, such as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CDs are identified and identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous settings regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD was collected by the freedb, all of the pieces are already carried out and also displayed the name of the artist's name and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the case that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; - key for your & CD; there will be a window system, and you can select the database entry that your opinion is best to your & CD's.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have selected the checkbox by freedb (on page & CD; settings for the settings), you can use this manual by choice of the first buttons in the tool bar. if you do not have local database, but the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the Titels of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the denomination in the first row of the input field 'Upeller title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be given more in the input field 'current title', unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments of diasions per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments on all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of data from the freedb is not empty. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors, so you are not only satisfied with the artists and album names (e.g. whether all words are beginning with large letters or not...) but also to check if there are any adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 Tags for the artists, album and title of a piece of field. if you are using ID3v2; a maximum of this option is set up; this option is set up by default settings; take a look in the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the files from the files into files anytime with the day Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 Tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags: they are not supported by all coaters and file formats. see the help to the Kodierer in order to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious with the style of out-out CD; it is not important as we are not able to register. for more information you go on the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. Pop or Rap for example are to be found among rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' you get back to the main window. click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editors will be back and you'll see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the data. simply enter the entries for the field of current product. just enter the product's title on any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way up to you all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Please note: this window appears not, if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line. only the titles that are selected or out. make sure that all items are selected, or press the button on all items are connected to the lower edge of the screen to choose all pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was launched through the clicks on the button. read the readout process, so this window will be confirmation. on OK, then we will see a look at the window with the orders and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the ground orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper part of the Fensters, directly under the knobs of the tool.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece will be read on the hard drive. the status of the program will appear in the left lower part of the Fensters in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message, if you are trying to work with a codierer, you don't have to install it. plays the not successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target file is not what we have given here in an example. if you have a write access to the file for the temporary files and the target file?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear, why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the code of pieces 1 into the format MP3. in order to read and write. please note the status message in the lower part of the Fensters, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have to suppress this behaviour, the number of parallel processes is unclear. the installed calculator with an AMD64 does not seem to read any problem with simultaneously read and encode (from however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now, the last one has been read, while another piece is encoded and a third order on the Warta, after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short period in the upper left part of the Fensters.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiofile;, you need & KDE; 3.00 or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the code your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is designed to compile, compiled by source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adjusted to your needs, if it runs once, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, and has a lot of variations on the settings. best read the step in step by using the options and settings. it shows screen printing photos of the different box cards and also includes comments for options which can not be used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still on this? even if only the help down menu of the program clicked, without any point of view, to go out of this somehow empty screen (especially when the program starts with no audio CD; in the drive is), or from an unusually short menu made of?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What about it? who reads it, probably already started the program started. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author can't keep this manual for a manual and change or modify it. at least, after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has sent this section to this section. therefore, this proposal will agree with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you've managed to pick you the source file from & KDE; SVN, then you don't need this information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmide; the MIDI- and Karaokespiers from & KDE; in addition to others, he has also with real-time graphics and karaoke real-speed of texts, some features, the other & UNIX; and MIDI-players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmide; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD will work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; it also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound-projection screens, which is required for GUS cards. ALSA is provided, as soon as there is a sequencing system.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the menu file. it appears to select the usual file dialogue with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also see a file from a & Konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this works also with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a music piece, open it and press the button to play in the tool bar, select the entry entry from the menu or use the Leertaste.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmide; one piece is automatically starts as soon as you go on the & kmid; window. (in several pieces they will be added to one collection and then successively off each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmide; one piece, you can jump to any spot, by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knobs and drive.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Song texte can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces are using texture event, others use lyrics events and again other both. some pieces have not even a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmide; you can choose which events will be displayed and even better: the erection-text file is automatically identified, automatically the karaoke text will automatically be selected. but you still have the opportunity to change this, if you want to see the other kind.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an erection styp, select the menu settings the entries of the events. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI-files which you can put together. these will be played by the series. in this section, how you can use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set up a collection, open the collector manager. you'll find in the menu collection under the point of organ... Click to New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection, by clicking on copying and then put the name for the new collection. this collection will contain at the beginning of the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the desired set in collecting manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all the songs that you want to add any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be stored. concerns the answer if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be chosen in collecting manager. there you can add a song one song with the button to add a song. you will select the file dialogue with which help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setup automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece added to open (using file opening or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically, add to the collection, if the collection is activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied to open. this collection will continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you have to open the collector manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order that will be played in the songs. if you select the series after the menu menu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove, or random order in the menu, the order is re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in collecting manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump one song further, select the button next song, select the song next song or press the key arrow.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song back, select the knocked out of the knob, or press the key arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To erase a collection, open the collector manager, select the check-out collection and click on the button solete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted, but it doesn't matter because they are not stored in the case of & kmide; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map General-MIDI events will be able to understand the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the type change patch to Bright piano in events of the type change patch to Trumpet converts and thus making a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-map because all sound cards GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices, and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file of hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which saves all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which is often appear as required. precondition for this, however, each appearance is a different text (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">DEFINE PATCHMAP... END DEFINE KEYMAP "The name of keymap"... END DEFINE KEYMAP "A more keymap"... END DEFINE CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that DEFINE will be used to indicate that one section begins (except for Options) and END that the end of an Sectionit is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I use in future versions of & kmide; support for devices that are not compatible with General-MIDI inputs.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section is specified in this section as the patch of General MIDI can be printed on your specific keyboard. as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equator is ignored. it is believed that the GM should not change in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the sequence and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to put all the sounds on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. sound 60), which are similar to a flashing. do not bear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file doesn't play a score with Patch 127 (defenses), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which, which is sound in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the "drum patch patch" (drum, tank, maracas & etc;), and not the one that allows the sound of the clay at the same drum (such as some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify what sounds on a certain channel or instrument can be shown on a certain channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As at PATCHMAP -Section is the order of the lines very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyboards for each channel and define several keyboards. you need to use several names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are used primarily to cover sounds on the percussion instruments. check out the included keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form a few channels on other hand. if you want to swap the first and the second channel, you simply make the very simple in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards which have permitting on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP Section 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, constructed according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you use the keymap option, you will need keymap with the name name for this channel. if you want to use the ForcePatch Option, all events are ignored, to change the patch on this channel. in this case, you will always use Patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch Option can be useful for example, to use the percussion patch on the persiders canal.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBending ratio returns to the ratio of Pitch-Bender-Event with the value, it will be calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value of 4096 is used, so in the map file doesn't get a decimalmas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM is going to play a sound with the value of 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are going to play on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmide; try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, you simply open the DiMIDI settings. you can find in the menu item, point MIDI-settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of Klavials (one for each MIDI-channel). you can see what sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain canal. for each channel there is a select list where you can select a instrument that can no longer use green but red, to indicate that no more will use the original instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (up to now) has two different views to indicate the mirers sounds. the view choose the menu item under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD display shows the speed, with which one song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">If you want to change the pace of a song. if you find, a song is to be quick to follow the text, you can slow down the pace. to change the pace, take the arrows at the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played, the rhythm, speed, etc., so the same MIDI file can lead to two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes at very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I cannot fail to force & kmide; but a typical MIDI file doesn't need a similar sound quality. if a MIDI file doesn't need a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you also have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) of & kmide; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem, you need to download a source distribution and install a source distribution (for example of kmide; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that & kmide; Drag & Drop. open the folders that you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all files from, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Disable before setting the setting automatic return to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can use the arrow button on the left from Tempod- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard bar, you can click on the LCD double click.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a & KDE; work area with my MIDI file and & kmide; in this way, I want to play a karaoke file. if I want to play a karaoke file, or I want to play a file, merely go into the & Konqueror; window and the desired file in the window of & kmide;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to add only one file to add a file, and add it to a collection, switch to the setting, switch to the collection, and the new; file will be added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you are using the MIDI-files A.mide, B.mide and C.mid. so, you only want to play the first file. so, you add the setup to the collection, and open A.mid your temporary collection then just like this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do not include B.mide and C.mid to create and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have made me MIDI-files or postcards sent. all many thanks! if I see this songs or the postcard see, animated me to go on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">At the moment I've been written by & Antonius Larrosa.Jimenez, but I try to take a bit of time for my planing, but I try to take me a bit of time. I can collect programming, MIDI-files, music and sets.</seg>

<seg id="1762">With the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective .Änderungen rückgängig machen</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; -files can be done very helpful. as soon as a DVI-file (engl. D e V ice I nam file) was created, navigating & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer for the corresponding line in & Latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of formatted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the most important output of & tex; or & Latex. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and installation of DVI; -files for different systems and righteous.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the DVI-file, the elements of DVI; -file is speckled and soon as required to a element in the DVI; source code. as soon as possible on a section in the & Latex (source code), it is possible to apply to the appropriate position in DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with other integrated .tex files. during the use of a project, a project can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & Latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File's settings: in this mode the DVI-file will be used in this mode, and there is no call of & eyepiece; it's not a call for & eyepiece; depending on the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Regarding viewing the editing tool, the three large-size selection fields should be developed into the document. the first selection process has been designed for fast delivery of the document, chapter, sections,... The veritable & Latex; commands for the maintenance are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field will be available for inserts of articles such as keywords, FuÃ ¤notes or duplicences. the veritable MÃ ¶ gations are:</seg>

<seg id="1776">The clamps after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] lays down the font sizes. if the font is set not at the beginning, this can also be done on the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code is given, the & Latex must be compiled; the easiest way to do this is the use of the MenÃ ¼ s or the button.</seg>

<seg id="1779">Slice the document of the document should be searched for the failure. when using quick construction should be started. when using quick construction, the eyepiece was started; this is not the case, should also be applied to the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (too. environment) is a text which will be treated differently than the remaining document. for example, a report dragged on the font or even a few months should work on the signpost of the font size within the area - Giant Sligâ (English. Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The entries are only within the environment (of\\ to-{ Do} to\\ end {environment}). there is no longer notice (number) in the surrounding area within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many people to compare the read and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain font, fat, cursive pressure, submissions, etc., will be added either with the\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ Müller {empt}: this command is designed for short pressure and long as long as long, until it is closed with a\\ '{emph} or another environment. a single word can be represented in a set with\\ emph {word} curve.</seg>

<seg id="1786">As soon as assistant, a bit text was given, a few adjustment for the better readability of the document should be completed. they should be a quotation, a few positions in fat and courses, and a poem for application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">As soon as the document can be seen, using editor-view or Strg E can be reprinted again to the internal viewer. with an external viewer, the window must be closed at an external viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1788">As soon as the DVI; file was created, the document can be converted or into one & PostScript; / PDF file is converted. simple, try and fun too.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a simple one-day file format (engl. D e V ice I). these files are created by & tex; or & Latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi -Edition such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -converting or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file, the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then be printed by file (in the viewer) (if the printer is correctly set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar light turns the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & Latex; source code is created, the conversion can be seen as well as other formats using the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preamp-search goes to the direct jump from the editor to the bottom-up position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers an appropriate setting for all & Latex; only needs to be balanced with only Modern among the application... tools of construction.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to feed the preamp-search, the mouse is positioned in a row of the source textes and to be clicked on the preset-search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is then sounded.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click on the middle mouse button; document the corresponding & Latex; document from & kile; we have to be set; in & eyepiece; be set up in & eyepiece; be set up as a text editor.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you want to use quick construction of the & DVI; -viewer cannot be wrong, it may be an error message, it will be indicated in the protocol file, or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocol file is used in the source code. as an editor, the protocol file is presupposed to be used in the source code. if you are able to view the error correction, you must be clicked on the error in the protocol, and & kile; jumps on a faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as on the appropriate button in the toolbar, a window is available to choose from the template model for the document. the default authors may be adjusted:</seg>
<seg id="1799">In selecting the document, a document can either be written from the ground or to the assistant to the fast creation of a new document. additional information are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Business users of & Latex, use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates in & kile; created, saved and uploaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new model, you must create an existing & tex; - / Latex file, or a new model can be created. & kile; can create a new model using an existing document and a selection of file's original document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a presentation to the New document, some character sets are replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing coding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">At its own presentation, it is therefore necessary to know what the variables will be replaced by the variables:</seg>

<seg id="1973">The troubleshooting, for & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting process was completely redesigned, as well as the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept has been implemented, which enables various implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for use of & gubed; the antaplus; one adds.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the Debugger for a project starts with the select debug plugins in the settings. with the button options next to the Debugger plug-in select the specific settings can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for the same time as well as the layout and the contents of the Featuresc file; it contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self-toolbar allow a fast response to a document without a threat of a write.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Day-file is nothing as file. they contain only the & ptionrc; and the day XML files. day-file bear the name of the speaker language and version, so. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of day XML, if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is wise to use so many as possible, so many users have a better insight and more information regarding work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in the individual. all over the possibilities and borders will be put in simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only contain only once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it contains only a element type than itself else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it & lt; attr &gt; a argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for the day type Class. the name of basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only for the Type Method. gives the name of the class to where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the day has a common-Attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>

<seg id="2017">All day XML files have to start with an & XML; Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces changed no, but pay attention on & & mlt; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; Tooltip &gt;, & lt; whopping this &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can be replaced. this does not work any leg, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review of the TagXML file, the tools are to start at the top in the & quantaplus; -window to start and restoring TagXML. a further dialogue is to follow, whose simple instructions is to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the verification takes place in the shop of the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt. scheme &gt; -element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this day XML file is to be schema.day.</seg>

<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in execution of the promotion, this text will be added in the document on the current cursor position. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful Action styp. with the help of this promotion, external applications can be used (or parts of document), which can be started. examples from & quantaplus; Even are the Schnellstart-dialogue or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">The first must be given the name of scripts and interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Though qualified paade are allowed to use the% scriptability: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / Scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in the case of a local document will be removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced by the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance running, the text contains unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control of & quantaplus; from the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event is usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above enumerable methods, a script of & quantaplus; on the standard input, which can be determined by default. in the selection field input can be intended to send the default. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output can be sent out. there are two types of issue: normal edition, on the standard edition written; error messages that will be specified on the standard edition, by adjusting the value of the selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to create a number of logical groups in logical groups. it is necessary to create a tool for each group. in this case there are not too many, therefore you can create a tool with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool added is added, you need to add actions and configurable. select the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this Fensters are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button on the lower end of the Fensters starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the matching workouts.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the rest of the attributes, and you plan to plan your use, enable you to edit Dialogue "Day," if it is possible to install a input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is a polite symbol. if you should remember the action in connection with this icon? replace we, before we have difficulties before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol report that the action will be better, we will use & kiconfree; select from the & kscreen;, graphics and programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you, what the promotion is doing, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In mind that the day, I decided to create a starting head as a symbol. by the use of green (green is usually considered to be interpreted, or should at least, a message for user signposted, that click this symbol no & lt; started; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol no need to be connected with the action. this happens to be connected with the action... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">If you choose the file, in which the stored symbol is set, select it and confirm you with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and set them with other tags, so there are still what you are, or confirm you to complete with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions for toolbar or to be divided into several groups. open the toolbar dialog for the tool bar. make sure that the desired tool is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to use Trenner (at the left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the Elementes, to be added to the tool, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to access a quick opportunity to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner will support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Konqueror might be the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by means of all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct file. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct file, but your business tool (n) should be loaded in the correct file, so that your tool bar will be loaded (n), if one file is open from the respective type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the form of formations. this chapter, as I describes one & PHP; documentation is for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has the already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you must search an existing documentation for the formalities - / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file again. let's first part, let us handle the second.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Update 1 = 12.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html Securities = Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.2.html / # Sec2.html / # Sec2.html / # Sec2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation baum. for example, you can see in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc = PHP 4.2) = table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Letting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = Durage.basic-syntax. html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # front of Getting Started and Language Reference. showing that there are no known border to the tree with its own content. there are no known border for the chess elite deep (except for reason) mdash; but try it himself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents directly onto a file referenced (and consistent on the upper end of the construction area & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">No spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & & lt; signs. this should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources Resources.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The ingredients for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is shown here. by marking the function of the function called and pressures of Ctrl; H for the context-help, there are only two types of entries here: the text list (ContextinguList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of using separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">For example, you can store your file docrc and save after $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / payments / quanta / doc or global use. then you will create a file (as if you specify this in your file docrc) and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and the value of important information is shared by the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best Web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do:</seg>
<seg id="2071">You can send us an email to your friends, partners or otherwise who are sent to you. at different places there is an email address, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), you can send-to-mail support, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive. users can be downloaded and easy to use, if our team is available as correct and easy to make use the resources. to make use a GPG / PGP key, the origin of the resources needed for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG-key (the passpares), or in the case you can pick up several keys, you can check out the input of the new resource (URL-preview can be empty) and click the uploading of OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be loaded by the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), on the tool's tool, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading the resource & quantaplus; the integrity of integrity and Significance. in case of problems, it may be careful not to notice. if the integrity and the resource has been correctly with signature, a message will be provided with the Creator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not able to work by a DTEP package. however, the preparation can be easily necessary because hundreds of day files in everyday XML format could be required. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD shop and Converting to DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. afterwards the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the character set out in! DOCTYPE Day, such as HTML PUBLIC / / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd is supposed to appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after transformation: when activated, & quantaplus; after converting the & ptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly developed & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these concepts and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter tried to build these concepts with these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working range is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection screens. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; it is stored in the joint memory structure of & quantaplus; this enables the group of administrators have a variety of tool, actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development for individual users. these are custom-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in user contents, so that they can only use these users personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a certain project. this can be found within a certain project for the files of a certain project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are provided in the Ordnerbaum project, which will provide common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editors window, the building view, the carton with information and tool bar. please do in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">One can view the card with the right mouse button, to get a context menu with the actual document, like close the current, other or all cartons, reloading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a read mark or execution of CVS commands.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right to a further context menu in the editors of the document, how basic processing steps (put / copy / single), machining of the mouse operator under the mouse station or opening the file, if the character can be named one file under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the Editorfensters are currently listed; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbar is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the tool being adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">If you want to add a simple day, for example, please click the icon to enter the day. if you want to set the data on this straight day. if you want a day to fill the attributes (such as anchor), you can fill out in a dialogue several fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The information prospects (QIT;) allow to navigate up in the information on & quantaplus; to navigate it to open and move. in the presentation with cartons are available for files, project, sample parts, document structure, scripts, attributes, and documentation construction.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool to provide & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows you to use the files in the project with the right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading or solete files from the memory medium can be implemented with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a model, pictures, program parts, whole website & etc; There's all the possibilities are open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; working range are always available, local templates only for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available script languages. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can find more information on a script by clicking over the right mouse button. more functions are available, such as the script you can start to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document can be set. by clicking on the position of the element, the Cursor is set on the position of the element. it's a list of commands in terms of navigation and collecting of the building.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other construction area. with it, it may change quickly Attribute and naming areas. with it, it allows for changing the attributes of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download documentation documentation for & quantlus; 'documentation, you can create their documentation, and by adding a Ordway doc a project can be edited, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cartons in the bottom of the fensters, can be reached on the useful information: the news window, and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document and all modifications to the DTD displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This carton shows all the error in the start up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such that there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor. the first mode replaces the source code editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: it is compatible with a document such as a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch to the source code editor, in which the changes in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">With the VPL; editor to a document showing the Vohandan editor and source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is necessary to change the source code editor. there's no plans to modify this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode does not work exactly as the first mode, except in the source code editor and in VPL; -Editor synchronous. with pressures of F9, this mode is activated, the cursor to the active cursor of a window on the window which will retain the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor can be set automatically between the use of a click or a click. in addition, the recommendation can be adjusted automatically. in general, the recommendation can be adjusted for quick computers and a large donation for slow down.</seg>

<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to the design of looking on pages in browser. you can add CSS rules on the list below list or delete. a change of the list is possible exactly as with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to connect an external CSS label, by using the button open to the button, and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text area like in a text area. under some circumstances, the cursor is peculiar to the cursor. the marking works as usual. text can be folded through inserts and removed via a button or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The entries of tags is done in the same way via the tool bar editor. it is aware that the add-on-day is not removed from tags: when a anchor-day, surrounded by text, every other surrounding anchors must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some works are disabled as the tables assistant or the lists-to-assistant are deactivated. later, in the & VPL; it will work in this release, tables or lists of toolbar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. why & kdiff3;? let me tell you, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The interconnection was very complicated because one of the Beiter many changes made in the same file. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The result was written by me, but I was not able to see what has changed within this lines. and there were no references to places where perhaps only the deposits had changed. the merging of this changes was a small Albatorial space.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning of the start. the first version of & kdiff3; could be found in a row and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare the text, simply copy him into the clipboard, and add him in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work, was the same and merging of folders. this function related & kdiff3; almost in a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is also useful if two persons can run independently in a piece code and changes. the original file (the basis) helps you use any other changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result. this screen photo shows three quell files at the intersection:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete with the same and merging complete folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; with the folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows exact differences and user-based differences on the possibilities of our color monitors. if you are frequent codede, you will enjoy this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are visible in a certain number of white characters, you can see at a look at the summary of the column in the left-hand side of the left. (no trouble, if somebody will change the back.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the others differs in one line, the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in various folders, you can easily use the Tipparwork by using the first file of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">2 file-couner2 couner2 conner2 couner2 couner2 couner2 file diff2 files 2 file 3 file list</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialogue allows file to specify a selection of data from the file's file (file...) or choose from the next time. you don't need to specify a third file. if you need the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Above the button file... you can select a folder if you select a file, if you select a file, if you use a file, if you use a file, then used & C if you use a file, then & D diff3; the file name from A in the two other files.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is crossed, the input field is active and can process. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file. you can do this step later by the door.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-button opens up a dialogue with settings. here you can fixed the options before you start with the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to get a lot of text, but only parts of a text boxes. compared to opening comparison, the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialogue, you don't need to select any files, you can connect the dialogue with the touch button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use bricks and finish, go simply a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall on a reference window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">The idea is behind? sometimes it contains a file, e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you should download them in & kdiff3; and then compare these files. now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy, add and then compare it.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can not withdraw from & kdiff3; only the text may be supported by text in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: a number of editors interpret the toes and text by text in another program, and add text (instead of copying and inserts). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the Info window. (note that window is optional) and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that the path leads to a file for long), you can rest a while on the line. then a small aid window is the complete name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the colour Blue, B, color green and C is magenta. (this default settings can be changed over the settings.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can be seen in the color, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings) is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is well in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text, the column is displayed. if differences are found in white characters, the colour is depicted. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is possible to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only available in character and commentary, for pre-processor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">Vertical line, which separates the text, will be interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines. if the tick is activated, the line will be activated in line lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the reference window) also has a Info line with the inscription:, the file name and [Gechanges] if you have processed the result. usually, it contains a text which often contains it even conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! to all conflicts is dissolved, it is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to the most dissolved / unsposten conflict to find out the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative reference is used, each difference is also solved a conflict of the manual at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line is displayed in windows, where the group will not be visible in the windows. this group will be able to make the current background colour of background colour for current field, and is a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic merge or by manual, no more line will be able to change or by manual, but you may change another source but again. this text appears either in the final stored file, nor in a Marking which you may copy, and weighed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; context conicing; however, it appears in the clipboard, if you copy these text from the result window. go with this function around this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the sources to ignore or ignorant C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">If you are using a window and mouse, you can use the arrow keys left, at the beginning, end, Strg at the beginning and end of the end, sican use it from other programs. the oversafts column can also be used in addition to the vertical image. click here to Naviews.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insert button, you can change it between single and overshutter mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button, synchronized the view of all windows on the beginning of the respective group (as already in section of the section) and the editable output window.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar includes seven buttons on navigation to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl picture above / Strg image downhill), next to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl picture above / Strg image) or the next / previous conflict could be viewed as a conflict. therefore, the equals must be distinguished between solves and unrest conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark into the clipboard, you have to copy the copying button (Cg-C or Strg). if this option is activated, automatically enter the clipboard and the manual head. be careful with this option, for you could accidentally installing the contents of the clipboard may be mistakenly deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2320">In accordance with basic operating system, UNIX variations are stored in accordance with basic operating system\\\\\. KDiff3 keeps the source of source code files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored in the next start. (menu entry - &gt; KDiff3,...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a writing with solid width. (on some systems, the dialogue also provides the writings with variable width, you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in curated Scriptures. if the chosen Scripture doesn't support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be shown in their pure form, but would be straight away. to these systems, the button is automatically introduces to an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, the values of the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or Return, the replenishment will automatically be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each choice will be copied into the clipboard. the manual will copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which toggle-type-type you prefer to store. the default value is the general usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same time, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines are ignored in the source code. only during this first step, white characters are ignored. this step is not ignored. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some Editors (on some systems) is identical to a car, but then, files with different sizes in the page-to-side comparison, though files are evident with different sizes. however, if this option is enabled, however, use a white character sets. during merging, this option must be deactivated. in the default setting this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, the numbers and matching signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after even smaller differences. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically and jump mode, this setting is displayed as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is speckled.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file. if you are using it only from time you need to use Wähle A / B / C for all non-time conflicts. if you need to ignore the selection of conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options can ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in Chapter to scanning, folders and assesses of a merging. look for details under documentation for the directory-comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists a older version, the original version of the Suffix .original version. if you already exists a backupside with the Suffix .original, it will be deleted without any other backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of the user interface. change you need to end and restart the change program. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language will be set up there globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following codes can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it is used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding appears a short note, what the local coding is. (this can not be modified here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this is influenced by special characters and interpreter. since the coction for any file is adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared to and together.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have any file, you can specify here, which is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you use pre-processing, they may not work with your codec. (e.g., your files 16-bit Unicode may be used, but the processing command can only use only 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can designate the code of pre-processing.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This allows you to suppress the changes in the text or review of changes in the text or comments. (note: this applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options can ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences between two files are shown in a color-encoded overclock; B, A & B; -gt; C or B & B; C. in addition to the normal, a second overclock column is displayed with the necessary information displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available place on your screen for long lines. simply beat the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Set the comparison side down to each other or next to each other. this can also be useful to displays from long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences between the files and then compare the files. a simple click starts to compare the file name and uses the file name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merging again, then the name of the most recently used output file is kept.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading one file, she is visible at first order. in & kdiff3; you can write your own preprocessor, that's exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example, cut off parts or to correct the recirculation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, she was given to use this external command (see above), then the output of the pre-processing command is used. you can only write your own preprocessor that's exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding edition line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought has been behind, the user's more flexibility when creating the diff results. however, it's an external program, and most users would not want to program the good news, but the good news is that in most cases or perl.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert the input in large bookings: SED's /\\\\\ 1 /\\\ 1 /\\ 1. the\\ 1 must be found on the first text in the first clammernage. the\\ U converts the text-mentioned text in major bookings.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you want to understand, you may understand it, and maybe you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignace of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example for a further processing command from 's' s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Jedes characters (' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you're looking to perform several discounts at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the vessels of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of perl, you can use a bit more details like perl. perl -e's / REGEXP / Erl / SCHALTER / REGEXP / Erl / SCHALTER (and\\) needs perl needs only (and) without the previous\\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'\ '\'</seg>
<seg id="2358">Data after the normal preprocessor will retain for the ad and completion. the other operations are changing, only the data that leads the same-off-Algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-pre-preprozessor is the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful but as with each function, the text changes or differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences, and in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to process programmers in a folder many files. from that reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete file extensions and lead.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal for merging. you can adjust the proposal before start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and simulated changes to simulated changes, without they really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leading actions in either with all (F7 key) or only with the selected objects (F6 key).</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and merge of individual files. you only need to specify just file on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders will be used, files will be used as the basis. if no target file is specified, & kdiff3 is used as a target file.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of files automatically starts, not the merging. to start the merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While the folders informs you a small news system about the current progress. if you break the scanning of the file, only the files are listed, which until then were compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folders, & kdiff3 shows a light window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and any folders the scan was found here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">By clicking on + / - click here. you can use a folders by clicking on the + / - click here. the menu item includes two functions of all types of subtitles and all sub-directories with which you can see all folders and can be installed.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a double-click, the file comparison is started and appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name is reflected the file yp in the first file (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the data type is different in the different folders, this can be seen in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane. in such a case, the connection watch is not automatically selected. if the merging is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the above picture, in the columns A / B / C, colours red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Files are identical as identical, if their entire content is identical. then also file is the same color. with files, the age is significantly reduced for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color is based on dirdiff. the colors of a sheet is back, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B is identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C did not have the same file type (eg. if a file and B a file is): error: conflicting data types. as long as those faults exist, the merging can not start.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (eg. if a file and B is one file is): errors: conflicting data types. as long as those faults exist, the merging can not start.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Mode for synchronization is active, if only two folders and no explicitly specified target file is active. then & kdiff3 is synchronize. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action shall be identical. if required a entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B does not exist, but not identical are: merging and the result in both files. (the user looks as visible filename for the output file only B; directly after the merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be connected to the file. if the files are different, but the same date, then the files are different, but the date of your files are different, but the date is identical. Solange such errors cannot be removed, the file can't start the file.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging a file is described, if the merging is successful. if the connection has been successfully concluded, and other melodic, if the merging is completed, you should see a final review and see whether the status is used everywhere in order.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialogue has chosen the file sharing method of solid analysis, KDiff3 further columns. these include the number of nonrepresentations, solves, not white and white conflicts. (the column for solitary conflicts is indicated only if three folders are compared or together.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either use either the just selected entry (file or folder) or all entries in once. if you have selected all the plugging actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target file, then in the Three-file-merge mode C is used as a target, when the two-files switch will be chosen as the target and the synchronisation is A and / or B.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have a target file, please check if all entries are displayed in the target file, also in the file format. there are some options offered by certain entries to be transmitted. check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To add all entries to the directory: select directory-up / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the keyboard hurdle) to perform the current element: select the action of the current Elements or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">When conflicting data types still exist uncertain merging actions, a message comes to the faulty elements, and you can select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you carry out all the entries, a slide-window appears with the options, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you want to simulate if you'd like to see, no changes would be made without the really changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then certain actions starting with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (together a single file), then a merging window (please note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are ready to start with a file, you'll have to restart your directory or press F7. if you don't have stored, a corresponding dialogue appears. then & kdiff3 will continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you're looking for a error message, you will see a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will need to move again to the problems of problem. if you have the possibility to solve any other action for the entry or to solve the problem in other way, before you proceed with the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were together related to yourself, & kdiff3; these entries have not been specified in the current session) or not stored in the later. even if you are using the merging, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merging action, these entries are together again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3,...) has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the displayed pattern, are displayed in the elementary pattern. it can be given several patterns with a semicolon; valid space holder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. file must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders are displayed in the Elementals. it can be given more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a partition sign. it is valid for: '*' and '?'. default setting is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders are displayed in the Elementals. it can be given more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a partition sign. it is valid for: '*' and '?'. default setting is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatized files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file is specific with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files are hidden -attribute. in other filesystem. this option allows you to choose whether these files are displayed in the Elementals or not. this option is switched on in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic connections compared to. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to the links show. this is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to file: if the option is switched off, if the option is switched off. if the option is switched on a folders such as normal folders and if it would be switched to an Endless loop and & kdiff3; shortened.) This option is down in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a full analysis of each file and shows the statistic columns. (the number of soldering, non-white and white conflicts). the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if they contain on files that are not included in files. (enter an appropriate anti-patterns.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folders about a slow network, it may be faster, only the change dates and the file size. however, this speed advantage is to be able to use safety. please use it with caution. this option is possible in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change of changing date. it is no real comparison to the files. however, the files can be viewed as large as they are equal. however, if you want to use the changing date, please be careful to use it. this option is possible in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">The synchronize mode is activated when two folders and no target file. in this mode the suggestions are identical to both files and files are stored in both files and files are stored in both divisions. this option is down in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file is proposed as a action. (this is supposed to be aware of the file that the other file is not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is down in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a file is replaced by another backup or delete the extension .original file. if an old backup file does not exist, so it will also be deleted the normal range of individual files, not only the figure of full files. this option is switched on the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the file-link may usually be visible in the file. if you don't want to move the window with the mouse. if you don't want to divide the option / text window, switch to the window menu and switch between directory & text window to switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably, you prefer to get a menu of double click on the file. as soon as you can store the file's file. as soon as you save the result, the status is done to do and the file is not replenished, if you start the files.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost, if you again lost the directory again: directory -menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with help of Kio-Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote machine.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a file within a compressed tour with a local file.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. please note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone. or... that's not possible with URLs not possible, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it may not be distinguished if a link to a file or file shows. then always a file is assumed. (FTP:, FTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change dates back from the original. (please note the option of the size.) (This is only in local files possible.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main practice is currently in KDevelop. KDevelop started to start a built-in differences on the viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences and then select In KDiff3Part this context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3 is used; if you have used a patch file in the format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. if you need to exist at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing files.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can select a patch file and select from the context menu preview. please note that not the original files does not exist. moreover, this is not reliable when the original files have changed for the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as Part 2 is carried out, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merging or file is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compliments) already exists. in addition, the name KDiff3 has already suggests that it can run like the program diff3 from the diff-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot of knowledge to the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers you have gone or go so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">If you have compiled the program from the sources, configure not the right prefix (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc) you can't find the code for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). you will find more information about this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters will be differently, these lines are differently than the same; however, if only a non-white sign is differently, the line will appear as the same as not identical. IF lines appear to the next to Each other, this is, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is recommended for every difference in the files where he starts and wherever he ends. however, this important information is lost, if the result is simply saved as text file, and it's worth much effort to design, extra an own file format, which may save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The expenses for this was so far too large. you can reproduce a certain version for a source A / B / C. to process large quantities of text, an other editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">According to the text, No src is suddenly; no src has appeared, and the text can not be erase. what does this and how can be removed from this text?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used for many colors as well. more highlighting might be confused and missing the purpose. do not use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. many thanks!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE, 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information, how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes are found below http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; on a system with & KDE to compile it, use the following command in the base file of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folders in your system, which is installed in KDE. if you are uncertain, you'll find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems with compile. however, please, in trouble, please report on the & KDE; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out the clipboard (Ctrg-X or Umbrealt-removing). add the text from the clipboard to the current curb position, or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files that are identical in all types of files, not in the Ordway structure, and therefore not in the target file.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to update changes to the file with the function updates.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences are displayed in the target file. if the target file doesn't contain these files, they are missing them after the configure. (the behavior is likely to change in a later programme release.) This option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are not able to run on a window at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), they are already present on the button to the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is deactivated. normal differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager is a miniature show of all virtual desktop space. it is quite convenient to change the ongoing programs to the desktop space, it can end their size to end or postpone it. this works both within one working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can all virtual working areas as well as the ongoing applications. the applications can be selected and even moves on the working space and to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window inside & Kpager can be moved. the movement is possible in both working space and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on, where the context menu is clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; however, the text-menu is provided; however, the symbol and the name of the application and entries are minted, Maximieren, on working space and berries.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if the application has been clicked.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual space. appears only if it has been clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If the checkbox is marked, window within the & Kpager (s) can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in the & Kpager, the names of the virtual space are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crossing of this field leaves the & Kpager, the numbers of the virtual desktop space. it is possible to take the names of the virtual space, the names are provided with files, & eg; 1st work area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the backdrop of each working area is also shown in the background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the ongoing programs are displayed as a small window in the & Kpager. otherwise, only empty space is displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple right corner with the profiles of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixel map. note: pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager is known in a 2xN hitch, like from Pager-applications in some other Windows-; it shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal pumping and vertically in a vertical row, which is well suited for the representation at the desktop area.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control system. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, the window as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs out of the control system.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button inside & Kpager; and subsequent expressing switch,... can appear to the Dialogue settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment it can not be changed in the dialogue: but you can do it manually manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor or register for your system administrator. in this file, you must apply to the key windowment mode in this file, and that's worth a value possible. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2483">Alternatively, you can make a movable screen. alternatively, you can choose a movable screen. alternatively, you can make a selected screen area (pressurrender mode) or to the surroundings of the mouse button on screen (eg; on the left side tables).</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated one mouse click on the same site. it is thought to help people who prepares it to Repetitive Strait (RSI) syndrome, and one mouse click on any mouse click. however, this requires a little exercise with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain without any pain without any pain. unfortunately, you can also ask pain with the usage of your computer, if you are looking for a doctor if not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even though & kmousetool; pain helps with pain in the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the beam because of the mouse is used, useless and as with all ergonomic equipment: the result can be selected for every different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and carries a mouse click, as soon as you break the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the mouse is activated, make & kmousetool; a break after it is done by the mouse button, before the end of the mouse is carried out. this way, you can execute the gypsum of the mouse button. the smart breeder requires a little exercise, but you can get rid of it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This thread has to be hidden after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intellifellows is switched on, the turning point is set (1 / 10 s). here's the time when pressing the mouse button, after downloading the mouse button, if there is no change in the mouse for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function is activated by a slow view to the left and back, followed by a break, one click on the right button. these movements will be stored in the $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt file; the first time started, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can choose between the & kcontrolcenter; go on to sound & multimedia, go there on sound & Multimedia, then you can adjust the sound equipment here. there is a scberegler sound buffer, set the lower value to reduce the response time.</seg>
<seg id="2507">This setting is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & KDE; this function is currently available under & KDE; available in GNOME or other window environments, please refer to the particular documentation to find out how to start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If all settings back to the opening of the dialogs. have already shown the button to set the button, the settings are set in response after the last dots of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best you use & kmousetool; initially, with the default settings. in particular, the smart breeder should be switched off. if you have accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can get the intelligent delay.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & KDE; in case of clash.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make aware of a mouse click without any effect: the clicks on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window, does not constitute a link. you can use the mouse to such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is pressed, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite simple. the trick is easy to clean the mouse, but also the rolls, which come with the mouse kugel.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse kugel. as this happens, it is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quick to view the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball, you would have to see the rolls. you can find yourself at the sides of the hole, where the ball has been used. mud and soiling, you can easily have a flat blade or a finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system used the design of & kmousetool; if you want to move in this case, it means that & kmousetool will not end in this case; the operation doesn't end to finish the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; under a different window manager and a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. as a result, the status of & kmousetool will come back, and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, trying to lead & kmousetool; continue using mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you do not want to go through a neutral frequency due to the mouse buttons. thus, safe zones for the mouse station are spotted, safe zones for the mouse buttons and menus, and the title of windows and the title of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent lighting, but I didn't make it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart machine is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes his time to copy it into the clipboard, or add any other action to move into a mouse button. but it is likely to prepare them to prepare them. here are some advice on this way:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent slide when you've just started using a mouse click in the end of the text area, and keep the button button, while you move the mouse button on the other end of the text and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click on the mouse button. thus, you know exactly when changing a mouse click. later, you can use the intelligent slide without the audible's mouse click. however, it needs a few exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; it must be installed, the XTest extension for & X Window, must be installed in most of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available, if the system has a soundcard and speakers, and this is correctly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse button. this program was developped for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and those interested in the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in fact that a certain period of time is going to be left, before the mouse button is left, even before the mouse button can also be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and give it to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there is still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character set replace parts of a text by other text, or as regular expressions, you can specify either as a regular expressions, which allows you to use the chat of the chat (e.g. -) by text or for the changeover of messages from & Konversation; or & Kmail; in a better understanding form.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for control of voice, the volume of the voice and the pitch. furthermore, there is a part of the VoiceXML specification, a further W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently & ktops are currently supported; SSML are only partially only partially only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default terminal, the festival in the SSML edition is used.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or sound system in the festival configuration is not available to 100nbsp; SSML text is usually considered very monoton.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters, normal filter and punching filter (SDB-Filter). as a result, it can't be synthesized as if the first sentence is synthesized, or return on the card, even if the language synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the stateless filter. with the first start of & ktts; it will automatically set up a set-level filter. you can modify the settings, or further import transborder filters, but will not be demolished.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest option to check out the device selection and check out the text selection. use the Speaker selection and check out a number of features and check out how the speaker has changed. do you need to have more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then, faster with pre-read, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which is very long last,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can keep text orders on the card orders or break, even if the language synthesizer will not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For this reasons the normal set-level filter will automatically be set up when you start the first time. it can't be folded away, just away. change nothing to this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Statute filters compare this text with a regular expression for statutes and add a tabular number (decimal code 8) to set automatically from the text (table below). note that the default statutes filter will be connected to the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied on & KDE; -news (kJ), warnings, news or the output of screen readern.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you prefer to check the normal set transborder filters, you can add this back into & ktts, by adding the _ sbdrc file standard.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card of Spreer selection, you can write access settings for the application. card card is indicated when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the card card speaker). in other words, there are no Speaker properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the appropriate microphone speaker, the characteristics of a set speaker. if you choose the speaker's settings or edit, chooses the speaker. otherwise the speaker is taken out of the speaker, the speaker which are the originally set for the original characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Choose the method for input of your choice properties, by clicking on one of the select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties for the desired speaker. if this property does not play any role, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this Ancruzfeld when the feature prerang out in front of other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor of the issue, it will always be able to specify this feature. the only case you may need to specify the attribute. if you know that a certain application text may be used in a different language as part of the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all characteristics in the speaker, which equates to the following command: click on the select button default speaker and then on speaker, which corresponds to the following:</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in waiting for a long time. you can also specify a order number. (no order number is the input 0 necessary).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Clesied down instantly when it started when it started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get a traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is structured and & ktts; it is likely to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, possibly a compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update GStreamer or uninstall.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work when I play at the same time with another application of music. if I get a text order, freeze & ktts; a message on the & console; appears a message that says: darto open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Your system consists of the problem that conflicts at ALSA occur to prevent the equivalent of multiple PCM devices. advice for potential solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I have installed them and can use it in festival, but kttssgr show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add a new voice in the file's $KDEHOME / share / comply with the other voice. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice at the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card interface, audio is install a setting speed. thus, the program SOX installed and via environment variable PATH. some Synthesizer module do not offer a setting for converting speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings are ignored, if you are ignored, if your HTML is converted into SSML. (see below) or if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reformerfilter, and set up the rate speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I didn't forget that pages with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENERdon't seem to work. in this festival, the XSL file will be able to convert SSML to Saber GENERATION. the same applies for the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">So I have added a own drawing filter, and now I can go into & ktts; not more satise or return. on the antitrust orders, the order was given only from a set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Interchangeable badge (point, questioning, exclamation mark, compression and Semikolon) must not be filtered for this sign instead of a filter for the statutes.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture) ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed (www.alsa-projected)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer is registered in version 0.8.7 or later. please make sure that the modules are available for GStreamer, by using GStreamer, using the command GST register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts at the audio output. if your system can also be able to play music and then start a text order. if you start a text order and then start a text order. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real shausen. if you keep a text order in & ktts; therefore, the current sentence is still available.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program SOX is used for general adjustment of the module, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install SOX with the command apt-get SOX. the program is already included in most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded & ktts; as tarball (with tar, archive), log in normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable file. change in this folders and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & KDE; 4 the module & Tape will probably be done, or at least only on request only.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for language synthesizer are created by default. some of them have a running age of non-free software. (non-free according to the Debian distribution), the column configure option shows the configure parameter to the configure parameters.</seg>
<seg id="2765">As a default setting, it is installed & ktops; in / opt / KDE3. if this file is not stored in environment variable $KDEDIRS, you have to specify an option --prefix = target. for example:</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD kdeecho echo tsd &gt; Inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktts; you first, check if your language synthesizer is right. follow the instructions that you have received with Synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">The quality of the votes is one of the best free TTS synthesizer. the quality of the votes is generally good, and there are several voices and languages. in many voices, you can adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You have to install at least one language. help you find on the guides you are supplied with festival. would you like to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these votes, you have to compile an additional module, therefore you need the source code of Festival. the German voices are subject to any restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice is still in an early development stages, unpack it. read the software in an early development stage. read the software for the Vomsu _ ru _ nsh _ diphone. select a kyrilline (8-bit) encoding such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Normally it is usually included in the & Linux; distributions as well. pick the festival so first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the option must be adjusted to the ISO 8859-2 option.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option must set up a 8-bit Kyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; one module for the & kcontrolcenter; the administration of network interfaces, the routing and DNA settings are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; enables users to manage a series of system and desktopsettings over a single, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to users the users of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings made from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings are shown in the & kcontrolcenter; the module settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched through a selection of kcontrolcenter; Internet & network settings in the & kscreen.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured, so & knetworked conf; the device shows at all, and setup of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers will be installed for the network hardware and other devices with the Installs of & Linux; installed and installed, network appliances need to be loaded by the following files in accordance with the following files:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings can be loaded, if the option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; the index is selected. with the types of modular network settings, this platform requires automatically identify the system used in the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform is not recognized, the list is offered to choose from the distribution and the relaxation and the best way. by marking the setting up non-again questions you can permanently set off. when the next start of the network settings will then be set automatically pre-configured.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The settings of the network settings can only be viewed in system management mode. previously, all the settings can only be viewed, changing mode is not possible. in the system management mode, you can order by clicking the button mode at the right lower end of the module mode. it's the input of the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider networking interfaces can be used to manage the systems of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Reiter network interfaces can be supplied from the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings can be processed by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. ankment of the button Advanced Settings shows the dialogue with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The TCP / IP settings can be used by a DHCP server or BOOTP Server. in the selection list the TCP / IP settings can be used with any system requirements. in the selection list can be used either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The TCP / IP address can be made in manual without any DHCP or BOOTP. IP address should be specified in the input field IP address. the netmask network mask is the subnetmask-mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If the setup is marked, the system initialized the system interface in the boat. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog, are displayed as a characteristics of the device in the device.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be sure that the IP address should not already be used in the network. with ping out of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. you can find whether the desired address is already in use. in any doubt the network operator should be requested.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances can be activated, depending on the need, or off-off network interface, you can choose from the list and click on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances can be activated, depending on the need, or off-activated network interface, can be carried out from the list and click on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">The IP address of the computer in local subnet fixed the physical connection to remote network, and will be used by default with the TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnetwork.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer has more than a network interface, the interface must be chosen to the grid, in which the Gateway computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer support is replacing the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer has http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator on the naming solution of the equestator provides a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified .DNS entries can be used by selecting a record and hinge in the list with the buttons, or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button on adding... from the group calculator can be added a DNS server. it will add the dialogue with the New Namdaver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to add the IP address of the DNS Servers and then add the button to the button. entry will then be added in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Out of the group calculator on the name resolution you select an entry and then click on the button,... It will see the dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list is especially well known for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for the TCP / IP subsystem. if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNA server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally contains the list's most well-known computers are some entries that support & apos; localhostos; and some special IPv6 addresses are still supported. this is still in the test, the version of IP is intended to replace them in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address provided by the well-known computers and click on adding... The dialogue is also known as.</seg>
<seg id="2828">The name of the known computers and adding the button to add the button. if the well-known computers has several also known as its name, de button add it several times and the other also known as a name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particularly well-known computer from the list and select editing.... The Dialogue of calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with click from OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes to activate the changes, the following command can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the Source textes.</seg>
<seg id="2833">The installation of the binary distributions (usually rpm packages) is sufficient, if & KDE is installed, and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download and install rpm package for download and in a console; with rpm like follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphic surface such as butt or the installation tool from its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & KDE is not required, but in addition, the development plan with libraries and other things needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only experienced users recommended. however, it is not difficult to compile & knet conf; to compile it. the following commands should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given in the second, all of & knetworkconf; selectable configuration files are acquitted.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix only are basic information about the integration of the PCs in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never discovered large spread. of IPv6, it is expected that it is in the near future. these description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to be able to modify the IP address of an network interface. in foreign networking sites, it can be requested via a valid IP address or if required, DHCP can not be used. any case, the IP address can not be easily elected.</seg>
<seg id="2842">If you want to use one of their own small (home) network interface, the IP address should be selected for this purpose, to avoid IP address orders with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below will not be relayed on the Internet, therefore, their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access to the internet for such machines are possible by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses are used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>

<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the band is integrated into the drive. with some drives, this is necessary, before read or write operations can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched, try & kdat; this option does not work out at any tape drives. possibly it does not work with all the tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on to integration of & kdat, the band is subjected to the band. use this option does not use at Floppy-Streamines.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystem log; is a & KDE; tool for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, where you can obtain information about your system, or where the system allows you to find out more information on your system, allowing users to find fast access to information about problems on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystem log; helps users to understand what your calculator is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which is not knowing where you can get information about your system, or where the system allows the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystem log; experienced users quickly access the fast access to information about problems on their server. & knotlog; therefore, some more advanced features are shown to be filtered by using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystem log; a number of useful functions. among other things, among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog-Servers and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition to the other chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & ksystem log; functions are available, with their help, the individual protocol lines are easily filtered and absorbs. individual options to be sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first of the system's most important messages, you have started, and it will probably take place in a small news system; the protocol file is usually taking place in the folders / var / log, for the normal user, don't have any permission to read for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also specify the filter bar in filesystem. in the default setting, the filter bar will automatically be displayed, allowing you to select the filter file. then, a protocol line will only appear when in one of the columns of the filter search is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry in this place. select the column in the filter file, and carry out the column in the filter file, and carry out the name of a process that shows you & knotlog; all protocol lines are sent to that by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the standard setting, allowing you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are indicated with the most striking color as protocol lines of the stage. the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Would you like to see only certain trial (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), for example, if you wish to examine the output of a specific statement as such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to the new lines, in the context menu of the main fensters to enable all the new protocol-line lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystem log; enables the ad to use several protocol files into separate windows. to open this function, use the menu in the menu window to open additional window, as soon as you have chosen a window, select the menu to display the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystem log; has an own web site to http: / / ksystem log.forum-software are.org.. you will find additional current information about the reference sources of & ksystem log.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; you can also find in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archived: knotlog; in & KDE; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Post Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Rect system develops rapidly to the standard for control of the program starts at the high drive system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD range.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not continue to see here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know anything else: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The so-called Binofile is under / sam and not under / etc. This is why maybe someone could try to take a machine to the V of the bottom, without a new installation and new format file. that's why you have to be sure that the old descending from there was there, if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD Post that the configuration files are located directly in the subordner of / etc instead of them directly in / etc. this file is c.c.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripting. basically, you need a script for every system service you want. system services include such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as setserial, which only started only once. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be found in the one hand under / etc / rc.d. if you don't have much use this file, even if you want to do some of the serial port in / etc / rc.d if you want to do some, what do you want to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Kernel is looking for various occasions according to the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the initial range, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can look into the second column. if you want to change your hand, you can change / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3 change. if you have a bit more, then you will repair your system, then you'll need to start the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do it starts all the right scripts? if you enter into rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this file. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How do you start and stop init actually system services? just simply: each of the scripting is so written that it accepts a argument and stop. you can actually start these scriptions actually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would be the httpd-server. it reads the name, and if the K includes the argument, the script will be called. if he comes an S, the script will be called.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people would like to build a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could have to run only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user-run level, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv. it should not be difficult to be difficult because the program was done so user friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand, simply trivial: pull out an entry from the area of sharing system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also modify scripts between Runlevels, or modify the position within one levels, by putting it differently. this is not only if it is possible to pull out an entry from the area of sharing system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted into a new area. to copy it to a new running level, you'll have to choose from the menu, or from the context menu, and in the target range, even if the same entry was already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorrow number of entry may not be charged. in such a case you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no possibility to restore the entries, which were thrown into the paper basket. let's carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use tabulator button to enable the various working areas (sharing system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop and etc;) as well as the Cursor keys to make a selection - or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To shift an entry into another run level, postpone put it into the clipboard (you can use Ctrl; X) and add him to the desired Runlevel with entries (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort or modify the names of a entry number, pressing the button to change the properties tab. do not use the dialog elements in order to accept the changes, or press the changes to the changes, or press the changes to the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss require all entries in the menu file, before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. otherwise they are available in the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise changes are stored by & ksysv. changes to the default settings are stored in a local syrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have made the machine with the standard running levels, and now launching the machine. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then, edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard run level to a sensible amount (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for version under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you have to view additional files in / etc, which are available only in these districts. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, such as system services are started in this distribution, the configuration is not valid for proprietary design programmes, but unfortunately not any standard. the authors of & ksysv, plan an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using one other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and even if they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) just stop without message if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -run level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be seen from version different. if you are using one other distribution, please send us more about the Runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program, you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must store this. either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or entry in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cartels, the user's user and user-list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears to be the user's user and group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are shown only if you have enhanced system settings (Quota) for users, a carton card can be made on individual settings. other card cards appear, if Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card is appear when Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This carton card appears only if for at least a set file system is activated (Quota) activated and initialized (it is recognizable to file for each user parameters), where users can be changed for each user, whereby space limitations exist in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map groups informs about the group of the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user's user, can be found in the field primary group. furthermore, users can mark the user in other groups, by putting it in the large field mark.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog characteristics of the group includes a list of all users. to add a users to add this users in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, add the menu or group or click on the matching hinge button on the tool. editing or deleting the selected users and the selected users work.</seg>
