although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year I would live now for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is exceptionally great .
as many of my @-@ generation I grew up with American films , I read American music , American authors read and its sport .
in fact , this country had a der@@ berry effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when 14 years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter through the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ d . the Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court decided to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was &quot; s , when the absolute truth is , g@@ love everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and this year , which I lived in Arizona , had only been reinforced for the USA only .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have lived in which I have lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people .
I even had a very simple love document about its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and the rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of its entry is for me , as he continues with its bott@@ len@@ ness .
he thinks with his mind , never behind the mountain , as it says so nice .
he tells exactly what he feels like a former colleague , and declared publicly dis@@ cip@@ ated for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his testimon@@ ies , and voting for him .
the 13 million votes , who won in the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that had ever reached by the Party nom@@ inations ever .
I was in german only .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ uous person , I asked me ?
I could not be Tr@@ ump , and his vot@@ ers did not bring people with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ al@@ ant program , took the people from all over the world , with whom I was able to keep up about Islam and his past .
even the tr@@ um@@ ps of the Welt@@ anschau@@ ung , not provided by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; in the present edition of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met us at our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to play the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to the major damage which I fights with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for their lives in her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
even if it fits in the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me patience and ro@@ gan@@ ce to me and my colleagues helped us to impact the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors that helped me much in my career .
these people , and those who are em@@ bodied by them , have found my love to America .
while Tr@@ unk his way to the nominal republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it was however , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or maybe because of his di@@ pped against non @-@ white people .
the dispute with the idea that people have been approved for tr@@ ump , because they shared either rac@@ ism and Fan@@ ati@@ smus , or because they were ready to see these things , I broke almost the heart .
perhaps it is even the tr@@ ump @-@ vot@@ ers as R@@ assi@@ sts .
the people in order , said one of my friends , is exactly what is led to us of this situation .
this is a super@@ fici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different kind and way .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears of the h@@ ec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that this vot@@ ers could , out of which most know are , for pro@@ stag@@ gering , because they want to win over a country , that she has dis@@ appointed it ?
with other words , they wanted to say that they are still particularly important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who made the cruel decision to raise a man , who looks forward to those who look forward to those who look differently than he would look like .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( ed . ) : as much as &quot; To all other Eth@@ ics &quot; ; word in white play on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as much as the great Van Jones called , has exactly what was so great so great .
millions of people around the world will appreciate the American Ideal @-@ anyway , whether myth and reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background are still so welcome to America .
for this country , as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he says itself , anywhere else in the world .
with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : to hell with multiple strength , religious freedom and the whole term of Pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ruins .
in all of whom I have to remember K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a client for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with human rights .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn would have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a strong &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; were Muslims in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; for the amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lat@@ inos is a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called her and their votes were loud .
as you would have someone , who is not as you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and quiet &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan decided with the words : &quot; God be thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not the United States . &quot; 36 hours later he was correct .
the country , for his son , was sent to him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer be found in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together ?
that the music that is played on both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with the ...
living music , who lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large waste land@@ fill , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists , but are popular from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) now plays in the church : one of children and adults &apos;s existing symph@@ ony orchestra that has found a possibility to over@@ taking them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students , has become the central interest of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the commune , which is located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs @-@ abuse and the B@@ ages @-@ violence .
but this after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth so a rare hopes .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ ti@@ cias O@@ ax@@ aca NV@@ I :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after the lunch at the lunch at the night in order to follow their big passion .
they are always l@@ ach@@ able and play with shiny eyes and playing in the Tru@@ bel you can learn the day for trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , B@@ ong@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
gar@@ ner@@ ed music of tr@@ ash
more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically in the top of the largest waste land@@ fill in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of instruments , which are made of re@@ printed waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments , made up of local fixed waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to turn parts of the departure in instruments .
the instruments were i@@ mi@@ zed Gei@@ gen , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ es , sax@@ ophone , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , which were produced from the waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles music , Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local Ö@@ k@@ ologist and Musi@@ cians of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , participated in the initial time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no place for the samples and we had to teach at the same place , to the parents worked in the tr@@ ash , and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something , which he had never seen previously : a piece of waste is produced .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from re@@ printed material and that &apos;s called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill HAR@@ MON@@ IC &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic land@@ fill ) draws the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash in each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poo@@ rest - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here turn it into something beauty .
Land@@ fill HAR@@ MON@@ IC follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight the illegal fishing industry .
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fought .
this entry was written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a@@ .com , a magazine which focuses on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
it was known that West Africa was known that this ship had already operated in li@@ beri@@ lian waters of illegal fish , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were brought up in these years and slightly inc@@ lined , a bill of this kind to be welcome to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the compress@@ ors , Mozambique , and Seychelles mobil@@ ised mobil@@ ised on the ship . she refused to give him an har@@ bours of the har@@ bours of the har@@ bours of their har@@ bours .
in suddenly , the Prime Minister Ki@@ il@@ u was a prime minister who just got anything of all things &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time .
in 2013 , the ship was sold in the waters of the region , it was not able to catch fish there .
eventually , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia for pl@@ undering of fish stocks of the country .
the core of these initiative , the criminal practices which protects criminal law and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Centre ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar as the six countries , who had fled to their waters at that time .
we have eight countries that are like to work together , and they are coming together , where it is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal project . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , it is hidden , and due to it extremely difficult . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of the regions of regions .
by the visible abuse of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types must be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem damage which have a delicate balance .
however , during actions against illegal fishing began to resolve due to bureaucra@@ tic chi@@ cks and by the sn@@ apshot @-@ emp@@ tied the information between individual countries , so the actions now carried out in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there are these individual countries , for example , please consult the existing licenses to existing licenses , news to suspected activities or details which had noticed , or experienced during a harbour .
Fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships even very atten@@ tive , when they move on the open sea , via satellite drives .
this allows you to meet the authorities to meet ships that can be found in verb@@ ot@@ ted areas . even so , the suspected route will be able to discover , such that a ship sur@@ g@@ rief from fish on the way to other ships .
in the case of ideas , such studies can show whether the ships have a fish license , where they were on the way , and possibly whether they have a stra@@ fre@@ gi@@ ster .
countries that are against illegal fish , can be found on the basis of these ships in their har@@ bours , meaning that the ships may not sell their cargo ships . and that they can even be forced to be forced to be forced , as in the case of Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then there &apos;s significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fish are not worth more worth@@ while .
and that &apos;s what we want to reach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Head of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ man based on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
closed front
the already @-@ called platform has been created , around 20 million US dollars to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rating in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish species , present because of the region of commercial fishing in the world . among these things , those of illegal fishermen .
among others , actions include the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake licensing papers , indication of Phant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected types and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you want to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non l@@ ens@@ hr@@ ined control system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was illegal to fish and a country could not go to my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , another country could say &quot; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale gor@@ ges are trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
date closed the closed front .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH was involved more than 30 investigations of more than 30 investigations .
there was criminal networks , uncovered , the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that used a number of frau@@ dul@@ ent identification and it has been tra@@ cked @-@ off ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
some of our studies carry us quite far into the networks organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he is building a system , the F@@ ISH @-@ i is to help to carry out more precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , helps to raise the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tra@@ cking , an NGO , which also deals with a fishing data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off for example , using their automatic identification systems , which they cannot be purchased by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information panels . F@@ ISH @-@ i is also helping to find a criminal company with greater precision .
model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations actually do influence on what is undoubtedly the global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth , together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana opened the platform Global Fishing Watch , is a platform that can be displayed in the world each of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of it , who is what makes sense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine to unite and their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project , in which a global system allowed the persecution of ships .
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not just crimin@@ als , but also sh@@ opper .
ships , which formerly known without a license , and hardly with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of those participating in F@@ ISH - i participating countries with a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fish@@ eries have been selling more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 gave up the insp@@ ectors to the insp@@ ectors where the Insp@@ ectors were banned under board on board .

other countries notice this successes . &quot; the effect is strongly that we are well known that other countries are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an academic objective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa disappear a year of several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
there are six countries assembled in the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . the aim of illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; with security is the aim of becoming more such initiatives and structures , even in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recently invested in Somalia with his first big triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 introduced a ship to drive under false flag . and not only the vessel was without a license , which now have been banned .
the ship was also reserved in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sign of the rules against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong character that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative work in the oceans is actually working in the entire world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .

the election of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was forced to take part in the election of 2015 . this was a twelve @-@ hour strike at the beginning of 2015 and a march to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezuel@@ an government , was planned on November 3 , the block@@ ation of the referendum to remain un@@ disputed .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to participate in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as the meanwhile adult men said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial , ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not sought out his life .
starting with Bür@@ de , the same name as his father , wear up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , who observed at the age of 15 he had enough sal@@ aries .
for 34 years he held the family confi@@ denti@@ ality for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that this was in order .
I felt like a secret magic .
as a child with 15 years , you didn &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I couldn &apos;t recognize that my father was a Di@@ eb , Fol@@ der and mort@@ ar .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the sub @-@ gl@@ amour , who was charged for ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had realized over the years the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as young , and said before a Federal Court against his own father .
its story shows that big power has made a parent over his child , and how this child was chosen for a way to salvation .
from the sports hall to the military service
when my father started to take me into the military base , I often went to the sports hall . here I had sought me with a young boys who made martial arts .
all n@@ essed him &quot; Kent . &quot;
I told my father from him , and some days later he showed me a black &amp; white photo , and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have seen you with one of the ERP .
pass only to that they do not lead you a day , and I will save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation of ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de to go back into the sports hall . some days later , he took me with the work on the military base .
he told me , I would be Geh@@ azi .
I was 15 years old and in the situation thought I was in order . for that my Father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy paper , which had heard the det@@ ain@@ ees .
these were all possible documents : university connections , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda and certificates , books , simple all .

cap@@ sul@@ ated the cap@@ tives are tortured .
my father took me a four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he had waiting me at the entrance to the car .
when he took me the second time he said to me . he led me to a barrier , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small dish in a ceiling , and commanded me to bear the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ um@@ ps of silver .
on this day , I went to the other end of the Bar@@ acke , where the stolen objects were ab@@ sent and under@@ lined me with a guard .
suddenly , he said to an open space and said :
then the det@@ ain@@ ees are tortured .
I jum@@ ped and saw a song that were tortured by humans .
they looked like a field of bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cab@@ els . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who had just discovered there .
they f@@ anci@@ ed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over him with water and hunt for a cargo of 220 volts in the gen@@ italia .

the tank there was there in the fact ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a man can do any other so much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father worked me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were frozen , and vali@@ dated and eyeb@@ rows .
he talked with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which wet people with the face to below , all were at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance there is silent on the matt@@ resses .
when my Father noted that I saw the det@@ ain@@ ees , he said , &quot; What do you know that Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot;
I oppos@@ ing the oppos@@ ing &quot; Why do you have to me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were killed in a pit , and was buried in a pit .
I know because my father told me .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms which were known as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero became a man together and killed there .
according to the survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero was accused of accused of death in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , who was accused of students of Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , by the former fo@@ ter@@ ian chambers .
the track , where you come to come here , is also the way to come here back here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took around this way and then were tortured for the first time .
here they changed its name and they were to be assigned as part of the process of human beings .
when she survived the T@@ orture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of above came to be re@@ located .
this was the lie - the river Eu@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of man and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Resist@@ ors &apos;
my father brought all possible fo@@ al things with home .
at that time I had no idea that the &quot; war@@ eness &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the army , I was one of the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear that war broke out a Baj@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military rab@@ bits who w@@ rest@@ led to an enemy , who fought the enemy .

but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ cky , then there is no war@@ ships but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I understand it just .
I was an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I was never before , into a house to penet@@ rating it into a house .
I don &apos;t understand how my father was doing .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , the du cars on the road again ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded to W@@ ut , struck me and cried :
if you go forth , then I will find you , and bring you stand down .
we need no one another !
so my father .
I don &apos;t have a great memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then I was a jacket and a roller swe@@ aters in wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , he acc@@ using the defence , a co @-@ liter@@ acy in this crime . I used to resist , no problem , they may wanted to put me to the load , what they wanted .
I was there to try out there .
&apos; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ ite act &apos;
now , where I am older I am , I am Reu@@ ben .
I have children . if you &apos;ve got two children , one recognizes the value of a life .
man develops further and recogn@@ ises that it is false , to kill it wrong .
I even went so far to say :
well , you &apos;ve done during the dictatorship of men . but to do the bodies disappear ?
why children carry out ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this a little girl was .
I always gave me the question : they were tortured , but why were them killed ?
it would have just been in jail .
I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people to kill these people ?
had these people not even had families , of which one could have passed away from the remains of the remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ ite act , which can do one person .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , and brought them to eliminate the rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were broken down and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you never find something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
I have seen how to have killed people ! &apos;
only to be clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just have just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought about my father , arose during a talk when he was under house arrest .
I made his alle@@ g@@ ations because of all of the greetings that I had to experience it .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know anybody else . &quot;
I felt in@@ dis@@ continued and asked me to what the whole range of Patri@@ otic atism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which she was allegedly defended .
I cried , I cried :
how can you say to me ?
I have seen how to have killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes committed , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he did not only &quot; Na then to me . &quot;
exactly what I did .
I will refund the first ad .
I finally recognized that he was a re@@ aker .
no one can see me that I am pre@@ ed . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest and still standing before the end of the trial .

the pri@@ des in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish magnit@@ ude of the National Court .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial committed between March 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 sub@@ gl@@ ers were found guilty of crimes against humanity . sentenced in 28 cases of life imprisonment and nine cases reported sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , it was acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officers of sper@@ son@@ en . # Es@@ War@@ Staat@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism
all def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military @-@ related , former police related and civil staff .
Pi@@ ero De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant women in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court decision is a historical milestone for all human rights organizations , who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , an Argent@@ in@@ ean organisation of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were killed during the dictatorship , or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed the country on the La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial site to be held by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drive &quot;
the sign with the translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , which can ren@@ ew his leaders .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the K@@ YO@@ TO , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can ren@@ ew his leaders in the last month , in the last month witnesses .
on a sign the Japanese word in the presence of Japanese word ( co@@ ach@@ er@@ ecting sh@@ a ) , which means that &quot; older drivers &quot; means , perhaps , but also with Bö@@ sem back , and # 8@@ 212 , as &quot; terrible drive . &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been repeatedly divided into the social media .
the mistake was the translator of Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os , who had fallen down to the local time . he was also aware of the local time .
the Kyoto Protocol , K@@ him@@ bu@@ n , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to so English translation ?
this shows that no one has read the translation .
this is a reward of elderly people , and in an international city such as the Kyoto , &quot; said Hol@@ mes .
the faul@@ ty English translation was removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drive &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; fields &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Protocol has been added to the translation errors . furthermore they declared that the mistakes had already been included in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation wasn &apos;t checked in her judgment before she was released .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; it was sorry that elderly people caused by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was somewhat detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers &quot; in Japan apart and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been proved as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ er , are involved in accidents , but quite a way to Sorge .
in the Kyoto Protocol , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by the sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the age of 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
during the number of accidents in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors resulted in the same period in the same period .
this is not called re@@ porter by re@@ porter in the release of Yahoo &apos;s comments on light , show that the pros parts of the Japanese seemingly contra@@ cep@@ ted against older mot@@ er :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible driver &quot; ) about the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually nothing , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I can &apos;t find that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are not a few of such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia .
translation errors are widespread in Japan and quite Asia .
the En@@ h@@ ish@@ .com website is a true locality for this bizarre error in English .

the reasons for the wide frequency of portable scanning are varied .
you need two important abilities : passive skills in order to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter also requires the active problems of the target language , which is in the case of breast cancer in general , the belief that translator in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be .
so it should be a French speaking in French speaking , for example from the English language French - not by French .

many Japanese company employ no staff with English as a mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for the over@@ set , Kost@@ eng@@ o or the relatively small number of English text in Japanese , the Japanese language .
some companies that have not have any foreign worker , translations are still able to manufacture translations . then the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is made as the best one , for trans@@ lators , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .

machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the simpli@@ fied and mysterious sentences , which arise by machine translation , show that this technology can do not replace human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages for some languages .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the in@@ sel@@ ing prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only from stylish grounds - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors like jewellery are acceptable , or at least harm@@ less . however , by large enterprises or from the government which have funds , higher standards can expect higher standards , you can expect a careful translations .
the city Kyoto uses a serial source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and zone measures on the Internet and Television
main site of the port as &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Presse and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , mel@@ ted ven@@ an Internet users , that they don &apos;t have access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later another user wrote that the Internet performances from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will not be available to us .
other online channels also contributed to the recordings of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups that Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros , the Government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament on the executive and the Supreme court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection has been cut , and recommended the users , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Z@@ ensu@@ r : activated your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an provider was again closed again .
this is the site of the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Veneti@@ ans , mostly popular , mostly in times of ri@@ ots .
traditional media has been committed during the reporting of protests in the reporting period since 2014 . then , the Commission released on telecommunic@@ ation and closure , when they would continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ outs .
amazing , that is still cheaper than two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade can be reached .
the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a sper@@ m @-@ out domain name system ( DNS ) is not available , but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website that transfers the National Assembly for its meetings .
former research institute of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet service providers use added value . this is a technique through the DNS server requests certain domains .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS is in reply to the server , or ref@@ uses to call on the call for such a website .
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ ash@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ outs

Flo@@ res was defeated , while he found himself in police station .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to the programme .
even though some channels still have access to YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections . thus , the Veneti@@ ans will always be able to continue access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on the current events in the country .
in Paraguay there are many girls to slave to get a training .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child in Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now they visit the house where she worked for years .
today Tina for the rights of children and collects testimon@@ ies , other cri@@ ad@@ itas who were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of course , which will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , fall schools &quot; ) , processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which it wasn &apos;t together with the family who lived there , who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the University , she returned once again to the house , and heard how the owner of the house full of pride and she said . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was never treated as a daughter .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , man called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money over@@ sees their min@@ der@@ years old son or her min@@ der@@ years old daughter to another , abundant family . in the T@@ ausch , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what do not mentioned , it is that the children must be paid for a few days of domestic work , which may be never paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse - and all that may not take up in the context of a contract which you can &apos;t rise .
established as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widely distributed in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of the society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ enga has worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - ra@@ ve witness testimon@@ ies , re@@ cher@@ ished and den@@ oun@@ ces .
they tried to call the things in name , because the feeling of gra@@ titude that is vacc@@ inated with the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
since the one hand , the family that their daughter is in faith , that she will improve their training in society , improve their position in society and make &quot; something of themselves , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that the girl is up with faith , and its exploitation of faith , that they would give you a chance that else would not get training , and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced only many years later .
sometimes they even experienced it even before .
in January 2016 , the relatively un@@ known phenomenon that takes place in the ob@@ sc@@ urity in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú was born in the hospital , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards , she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the budget of the former military service of Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo as the official of the inhabitants of the population .
Mar@@ ín lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants of 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira ran long as long as with a Stock on Mar@@ ín where it suffered a deadly injuries .
this should be the last exec@@ utions in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela performed deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society in the Cri@@ mean age of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the Girl .
it recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people arrived at the protest in protest and demanded that there was no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; be@@ amed Tina Al@@ var@@ enga .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions were boys and girls .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil social organisations required an impressive investigation of the case .
it would like that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girls who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girls .
if the case is supposed to be the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín , the case could be laid out in the history of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for labour , they live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k went to her father , she was in charge of his father , and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work to all work and began to sell , on the street or on the market for swe@@ ets to earn money .
they went all further to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ enga has worked between four and six hours each day .
they had to share the time so that you still remained time for learning .
she stood in every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
fri@@ days for example , they put the refrigerator , p@@ utz@@ te the living room , polished the furniture and of the surface .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learning .
ever they had finished with learning , the more time had it .
however , this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ enga says , she had never been hungry , but did not get rid of food , but I was not allowed to pick up more books from the library of households as food from the refrigerator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminds me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the land@@ lords , a former military and sympath@@ isers in the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some of the land@@ lords of the host@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him and editorial items such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
thereby he tried to convince them to convince the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he gave them for intelligent , but not to her . &quot; the budget had to meet someone who heard about politics , &quot; says it , &quot; says .
&quot; you have not allowed me to visit my family to visit my family as she would &quot; learn &quot; bad suggestions &quot; to do so that Al@@ var@@ enga , who belongs to the Guar@@ an@@ í Group , to speak home to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord , feared that they had to lose them again , they would lose them again .
however , her was completely clear that they had paid them for everything that had paid them out of their hard work .
also in the school , Al@@ var@@ enga is discre@@ te . &quot; a thing about which is nearly never spoken , are mut@@ ing , and the Shi@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school if they are at school .
because the other children of parents have seen , they immediately recognize that someone who doesn &apos;t have any parents , a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I was able to load anyone at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time where friendly friends arise , I felt very clearly that I was one group .
the insulation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job all for cleaning and nur@@ sery in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ovsky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little Fellow for my little daughter , who plays in the morning and in the afternoon .
learning .
please note you .
beginning on Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by , wrote that it would have been a fine @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave its telephone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; you like little children and is very nicely , &quot; wrote them .
the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the State Ministry , who wants to work . &quot;
then , the author of the ad took place once again :
love friends , I have found a found . I &apos;m afraid , whether it works with her .
thank you , I write , if something is something .
business was completed .
in the pro@@ log to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , such as long ? ) , a collection of Zeu@@ s say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes :
in the course of our history , we had to shut down systems such as slaves , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ship of the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ous country ( which had to be regarded as half as Hal@@ b slaves ) , and that we are still going to go out that many girls and boys are engaged in a system of slavery , where it was easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft bill writes about Egyptian users of social media to register in the government .
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary report recently ordered a bill to &quot; the regulatory submission regarding the use of social networks . &quot;
when he was accepted by the parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authorities to register social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a place was set up , which was assigned to use an permission to use social media , citizens and citizens .
within six months of acceptance of the law , users would have to register and users in the site with their real name and personnel numbers , to register social networks .
there is no longer to do this , so the sentence of up to six months in jail , or a money bu@@ ckle .
the bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ ms and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application which runs on the Internet and uses to communicate with other by voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is rejected , as the scheme is rejected , as they account for the benefit of their registration , which is not to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government currently does not plan to guarantee the regulation on stage of the social media company .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and conve@@ ying of the bill , told the magazine Al Monitor , registered users and users received a password and a password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
it could mean that Egypt is planning to maintain a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . due to those who would be able to address the Egyptians , and the Egyptians would be able to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known that such plans have not exist .
experts and experts are very skep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the templ@@ ates .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technolo@@ g@@ ist ( on German &quot; chief researcher &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal Rights &quot; ) , writes Global Vo@@ ices :
I have been strong to do with the technical capacities and understanding , neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they are so that as they seem to control a physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , then it means that they are a strong monitoring system to apply to citizens who apply for a permit or not . so , this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings , and to carry them a trial process .
this is technically un@@ realistic - but in Egypt , everything is possible .
in order to be passed as a law , the draft must be discussed at the European Parliament legislative elections and the constitutional Compl@@ aints , before it returns to the plen@@ ary debate .
whether its adoption and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control will be used , and be sure that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y filed an amend@@ ment to Cy@@ ber crime , who was not guilty to a life @-@ sentence for those who was found guilty of &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest action . &quot;

a sub@@ species of larger family of Leop@@ ards , which are among Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the fra@@ ctions of their living space , as they always can find less prey .
why is this specific type of Leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Per@@ si@@ fication of the power station is the only remaining Rau@@ b@@ tier in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the Health and the Ged@@ ser of ecosystem . it has also been present that a big smoking area is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is in the free game @-@ way to see zero . when the team is in video that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , breaks out R@@ aza in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza is passionate and other side of their country , which is not only composed of war and conflict .
it has been involved in the field trials for six years , and have been involved in wild animals and education programs for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and continues to be set up for wild animals in the region of Kurdistan .

in early March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o decided to re@@ build the life of those who were affected by the &quot; Thir@@ ty cat@@ astrophe &quot; from March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an Atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had the cat@@ astrophe .
in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai in the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , in the Nor@@ theast of Japan , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring towns of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear throughout the coastal cities of the map .
even the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a at@@ om@@ ar accident that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows that from local point which have been reached after six years later to re@@ build the live @-@ based resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of the person .
the residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts are in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i achieved the greatest achievement among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima reaches 70 percent of the final .
however , even six years after the cat@@ astrophe that ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ ks were ev@@ acu@@ ated in the final spare parts for six years .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ bows .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases .
almost 40 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation in 2011 were ev@@ acu@@ ated out of Fu@@ kus@@ ag@@ i . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who were ev@@ acu@@ ated according to the disaster were used in final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the work of the work and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ f@@ ets .
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newsp@@ aper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools were affected by the evil , its gates are open until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult to be more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing villages in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only accounted for 30 percent of the fishing industry .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the at@@ om@@ are accident , have moved into the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of the agricultural land large @-@ area .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of its ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic bomb , as well as 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , there is a nuclear power zone .
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered in re@@ covering , but also at Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains true .
the tourist elections in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same stand , as before the bad . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the cat@@ astrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was harder to earn their habitats .
is the native population to the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture of the native population , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and , as well as you can find themselves on the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction to the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung declared :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey by more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population of experience .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the main @-@ resident inhabitants are coming to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and T@@ sun@@ ami@@ s to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ ami@@ s .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents said that there was still not enough for cat@@ ast@@ roph@@ es prevention .
as it stands to those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated out of the Fu@@ kus@@ hima prefecture .
in her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newsp@@ aper has strengthened its attention to the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ bit Un@@ if , who had to experience Japan each .
nearly 63 000 people ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima were moved to nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the Pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little over 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , have been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of its home Pre@@ fecture .
in cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ des regions , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , still known as 50 years old . you can compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive building projects . this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if you met people from other countries , the other language seem to seem to be larger than the council .
however , after a while , one can see that it seems more than it seems to have a look at the first glance .
these global connections are important as they are important to claim our perspectives for our perspectives , and remember our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that will get less attention in reporting often than they deser@@ ve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt with someone about voice and country limits are very strong .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the council of Greek culture and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time where they worked with men from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences back in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 this week was delivered to the intensive station in the age of 33 , a police officer arrested in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest march to their savings .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of G@@ oi@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ mil@@ n trau@@ ma and suffered several fra@@ c@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now passed him into an artificial com@@ a .
its condition is regarded as a critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who pre@@ ached itself quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures of the police officers also recognize the face of police officers , identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of G@@ oi@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the pron@@ ucle@@ ation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he heads in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with its impact on the face of Stu@@ dents Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would be a police officer arrested by a protest@@ ers and on the intensive station , would be his face to see six months in television , and the entire suppression would be doing so doing .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , divided the video on the net as Mat@@ eus of police officers attacked and attacked several plum@@ bing shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in the social networks .
in the below , Cli@@ p showed the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in one of the other state , there are now 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to give his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado has been calling for further violence against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás on a memorial day :
G@@ oi@@ ás became a wave of political violence here . here , the military police arrested a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App in S@@ econ@@ d@@ ary School . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva who has attacked him from a polic@@ emen who has been attacked by a polic@@ emen with a stroke .
police transfer
G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday it came to brutal police officers .
polic@@ emen were established in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers have built a stage for speakers , rubber , and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ab@@ stain violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media displays , by putting the focus on another , un@@ expected protag@@ onists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a de@@ gla@@ zed glass windows in order to make his photo their front pages illu@@ strative .
against the O Glob@@ o , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set on the bus .
there is no chat o@@ vers@@ aw reason , more than a broken window disc as over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must be seen even if you have stri@@ ving to any form of Sach@@ damage .
in this case , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a warning importance and the typical of the military police , with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the fron@@ tal course with the police . &quot;
the For@@ gotten For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso closed nearly hundreds of sugar @-@ tubes factories in all Cuba ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i Palace , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as Central - to Spanish sugar mill , un@@ explained that there is no n@@ enn@@ il@@ able sugar content on site .
it is two years ago , when the activities were placed in the sugar @-@ tubes factories .
according to the explanation , the sugar@@ cane industry in the region is silent , and the factory lost and after its plants , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained left .
for about 272 workers had to find themselves .
some changed the work .
other re@@ signed and pen@@ sions daily to the factories that are still intact .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ data veter@@ an , who stands out every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not have its sleep .
he heard that it has been in the east of the sugar be@@ tube factories that have been re@@ active after a long period of time , because they were obtained .
this was something that he was not unexpected .
N@@ ene is remember exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i get the sugar tubes factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugar@@ cane industry is already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prizes , the low market prices , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motif for some decades a motif for the country , but the bad in@@ thia have already been no novel@@ ty .
why , the Cuban sugar @-@ tube industry was eliminated ?
the old railway station of the municipality saw already better time .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar @-@ tubes factories was technically out@@ dated , and hardly more competitive they were un@@ usable for the country .
initial idea was to concentrate to concentrate on the efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories to produce the sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
is the solution for unemployment ?
the motifs , which led to such measures , were the small productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the random crisis on the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , will be issued by the 2016 report , &quot; Land@@ wirtschaft@@ skammer &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
when the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar would cost about 85 million dollars for the country .
no everything ran good .
&quot; the present day is going to be with safety in history , &quot; that were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from this process began the process of re@@ structured in the sugar@@ s industry .
during the following years , a total of 98 sugar @-@ tube factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for continuing education .
the same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known , about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all those surve@@ yed : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus , they will receive a full @-@ time working group .
before the first half year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially dedicated to documents that would be removed only by the parts that are removed , the address and the date was distinguished .
all were signed by Ul@@ um Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could be approved every resolution .
from there , the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the still@@ ted factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money , &quot; as@@ sures any money in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for the pension in one another system , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the dis@@ closure of the factory , which he helped , helped .
with every part , which he remote , disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and major jobs was removed .
in many cases , no alternatives for employment and services have been generated in the communities which were generated in the communities were generated .
we never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech given from 21st October 2002 , when the President had seen in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories would not have been in operation for five years , everything would be well @-@ run .
the population of the population for the closure of the sugar@@ cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted high by M@@ elections .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i learned that many things are changing , but not always to recovery when a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory lock , or better said , when she began to take away , they heard them on the road to asph@@ alted all the road , and also other farms .
without working in the region , and with the age of advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without any future effects , many young people left the region too .
in the area , a food factory has been created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started to work .
nine @-@ forty forty forty forty forty in@@ thia bring to the old soldiers to spend a two @-@ out Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not the sole , but there he lies the lies , which man told him , not .
they have been cut him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes over 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is missing on strength but because it is banned .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to supp@@ ress and maintain your own culture .
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows first nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in all Canada are engaged in the topics that are important for them . do they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of wander@@ ing workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an Tour has been in charge of mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to create youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were directed by a teacher of David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop increases to ensure that the young sub@@ tra@@ ps in discussions topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self @-@ acceptable , or whatever them is in the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the chief .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o is named First Nation in British Columbia , for example , a road section in western Canada , on which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous and young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were not checked in the cases .
the next video of the Nem@@ ap@@ C@@ ree First nation uses the motif of a video game to con@@ vey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the global@@ isation is .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous Langu@@ ages , although the young people in the First Nations are not always prepared in German language .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded the Re@@ fra@@ in to C@@ ree .
the young people took some help from Gary J@@ olly by the North@@ stars hip @-@ hop Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ Twitter of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available , as a translation to the English language , as translation into English , which is translated here to the German language :
sometimes I feel , nobody would be interested in me .
but I try to go on earth for my days .
this is the day to take you to our ch@@ uria .
because we have lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will be able to get ourselves a day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go as well as our youth .
so they can do this , what they have the creator of the creator .

in Japan , one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what is exactly on the menu , you will find exactly on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to , &quot; plasma models of the dishes &quot; ) from each food which will be served in this restaurant .
the clients see this plastic dishes , and decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry , dedicated to the production of this plastic meals .
in the to@@ til@@ ation district , Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a number of these small companies that helped us that the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a was documented over 20 years ago .
most of the Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they are not even more fru@@ gal . however , a new trend is turning today in the current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
when Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual Twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic bu@@ oy@@ ancy cell phone bands , as they are displayed at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu in the Swiss department store .
many of these artificial foods have turned into kit@@ esur@@ fing objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nific@@ ently :
here are a few sho@@ cks at the Tokyo station for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom in essence is becoming increasingly elaborate .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) is transformed into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we have found a good use as a mobile use .
also this part we have produced for the Tokyo train station .
and here is an apple , your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple look , with a not@@ ch for mobile , this is a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight .
some cell phone and mobile designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that serves with white rice .
on Twitter , some users have their doubts :
are someone of this would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can inher@@ it my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic bag may also be able to accept a less loss of appetite , for example colleagues or family members of un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting the ice .
in addition there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and g@@ yb@@ den@@ ced by dried salmon .
for more curves for plastic dishes , you can view it under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you want to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the restaurant industry . as for example , with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .

in reports and foreign media about the inf@@ amous &quot; struggle against drug trade &quot; in Mexico . however , these reflect the extent of the human tragedy , that this struggle is bringing together .
the reporting of drug Bosnian like El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , someone of someone at the sad@@ ness or the communities that have learned life to life with the pain .
there are behind every LEICA , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of every year , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose bets can never be healing .
therefore , the Mexican news portal in Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico won the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co ( &quot; Franco : &quot; to life a voice that will give these victims a voice in the fight between the law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els in their struggle .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as :
organised crime , we not only fear our lives .
the effects are much shorter .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug traders and all municipalities that are so many kilometres to buy a bit such as milk as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who seek secret tom@@ bs after his son .

on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .

it is the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but the gets you no longer pay , because they require a death certificate .
what should we get there ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we have to have the international community the conflict , the cereb@@ ral and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readings and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a student of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico wrote this contribution from tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as a normal , no matter what makes it appearance :
many years now , I know that I &apos;ve been doing for some years now .
I will pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken and see the title pages with pictures , that &apos;s actually only from a text@@ book for crime or from specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one , the ange@@ er@@ ous or sad , it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can not be valid and consider it as normal .
she writes :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ous@@ in consider that he is great . and it is not normal that people can hear more about the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ ations &quot; of the road , when they go through the streets .
for me , the when they would have to hear those who have lost someone who have lost and those who fear them so something happened .
I see our weakness , if stories to blo@@ gs are in a statistics .
the Tat@@ en@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighboring village so that they were eliminated . &quot;
I think they are trying to talk about these lifting of lifting , if they are not stir and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; four months of pressing in the main city district : &quot; it describes how armed criminal month for month money was not only destroyed by the business until they were destroyed only the business but also their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain goes on , the g@@ ma remains , the fear will come up again , if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also have changed .
we only contact us when it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
you finished their report with the words :
we want to be arrested that others will be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they lead you or kill you .
in these terrible days , I asked if wine could solve my deep root feelings , but the reply is no , because I don &apos;t forget how to get we@@ t . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he takes questions to how : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the endangered city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of the age , whose parents are care of care .
Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had made a egg , potatoes , potatoes and warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the baby does that dwell in him . this is his name for the preparation of small bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left hand - one for every year .
however , they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ le@@ ased for boys for the whole life of violence and had to learn to life .
when he was five years old , he said that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day to ended his childhood .
his childhood had been past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father saw , was shot by armed men from a steep car .
the Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez , said :
Bryan was born in 2006 , as violence through the organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of people according to the civil Security Council and the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country in the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of the head@@ lines in view of the head@@ lines . this project reminds us , but those who don &apos;t forget to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; the Data journ@@ alism project has set up the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade , who in the country in the last four decades , in practice , natural manner .
if a picture is an un@@ true words :
&quot; sharing &quot; Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he finds , these images are represented on which violence is depicted .
the facsimile check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to lift a rum@@ or of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or counter@@ f@@ eit .
but how is the years after something the first time is immer@@ sed ? content in social media , no matter whether come or un@@ true , do not seem to be .
let us take this photo of a terrible pain in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) ( DR Congo ) .
since his first publication it has been mis@@ leading to pictures , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it gives questions about our conversation to messages to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC )
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker drive the place San@@ ge in the East of the DR Congo , and explo@@ ded and explo@@ ded over 230 people .
after the civil war in Africa , Africa was negle@@ cted for years and devast@@ ates devast@@ ated streets . the streets in the region have become dangerous place of stroke , the difficult to drive difficult .
typically , the tank trucks were victims of the victims .
described as a fire@@ ball , a fire ball bearing houses , including a cinemas in the vicinity , the full of people , the football World Cup .
houses dem@@ ol@@ ished and reduced bodies of the streets in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5th Multi@@ ere photos of the previous day , the terrible scenes of this day .
above is an example for this .
it shows rows of red body that go on the ground up for people while watching them .
but here you can not find the story here .
over the years it became the same photo several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms responsible , but not thus attributed to the load of sustainability , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar .
on 3 January 2015 the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the emp@@ tive towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on on the remote village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically the atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down in the streets and br@@ ushes .
reports were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to include bodies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were broken , shot or burned .
only using satellite imag@@ ery the follow @-@ up time .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army @-@ point in Bag@@ a was an permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ erian and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from the year 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here &apos;s the picture of the DR Congo is back on , when it was a proof of evidence for the fact and the potential extent of the attack .
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , it is actually the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of patches with flaws ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was released as a reward for massage .
even a step further bring to personal comments as this example , the DR Congo comes with sources of the mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge also appeared in combination with the kill@@ ings of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who could flee the stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some of them by burning .
while other by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , Po@@ sts like the following that were brought together with photos from the DR Congo together with photos from the DR Congo .
this image comes from a Saudi Arabian Peninsula , who claimed 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a being said to have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to get this information .
the original contribution , which was on the last dated April 26th , 2017 , can be called here .
other news agencies , the AFP came as their source as a source , obviously had a His statement , but did not prevent the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide operating range of fal@@ seh@@ ood
traces of this false coupling coverage through to the years 2011 and 2012 and come back from all over the world .
using a &quot; um@@ ped picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
a converted picture @-@ looking back to the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are still very similar to the DR Congo .
they originate from a mixer mask private pages , platforms in social media and non @-@ national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have false reports , exp@@ elled other words , others tried to have counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing counter@@ f@@ eit notes .
we have some examples of the abuse of mis@@ use and they have been associated with the respective countries in connection , based on what page them were published . this means that we want to be more significant than by the language alone .
from the below listed countries ( which were also related to each other ) several examples of mis@@ use were used .
some cases which can now be re@@ ed out ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
a false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ related countries are still available on pages or server , with the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ cons are still available .
the countries in grey are examples , which are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available on the Tin@@ Eye .
as a memory , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been published in an online discussion forum ( addressed in Al@@ er and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

this post , which addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo will NOT BE Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
the news of these news , the president of Myanmar , decided that the president of Myanmar , and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya in 2012 , and brought the story with the picture of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release , the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 on students who were arrested by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , it expressly stated that the image was not from the killing , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar @-@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the image later was in connection with the massacre of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that it would give connections to Nigeria .

the DR Congo appeared , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ b@@ ate a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am &apos;s massacre on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took place in the name of the Islam@@ ist , a larger interest in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was split as a reward for the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) , but the messages that were linked to no religious context were taken out in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to set attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison by Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that allegedly was allegedly written by one &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre was killed in circulation , put on discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared the Fal@@ sch@@ message .
from the embassy in which the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty usage of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other countries in the following countries ( at the portfolio in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye also has a completely re@@ ty : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , The Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / dat@@ est@@ amp ) exist on Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and download them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ u . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original crash of 2010 , the picture may ultimately become a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or fra@@ mes ( inser@@ ting ) that make these Po@@ sts through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Muslims , or Muslims in defence of Muslim - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddha .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how a African life is rated by a European or French life .
religion that want to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it &apos;s worth to investigate how images can be used in connection with this efforts .
however , a lower question is however , what happens when Les@@ ern can not give these images for no longer faith .
with social media , there are about people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ inten@@ tionally , to practice the water around a tragedy .
suggested this mood in the error and fal@@ cons that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and it is the actual gray of what is actually in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has been updated already in detail ( here for example ) .
a argument is that the back of pictures of a pasture that comes to recognize the tragedy . to time , these images even demands this pictures even by the victims .
at the same time , the concern that violent pictures reader and spectators should be able to emp@@ tied to emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , examined as violent media , to help others ) .
while there are some violent represent@@ ations of the news system , the fact that they are indispensable to be indispensable for today &apos;s news effects .
Technolo@@ gic experim@@ ented because with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thoroughly aware of the situation in which a picture is something that actually will be replaced by the context or in completely mis@@ sive species can be used .
a any inquiry into fal@@ lo@@ wer@@ age should also be taken into consideration as international they can be taken into consideration as international .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog revealed the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( such as d@@ t. un@@ translated ) , language to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are hard or not at all .
these words are in each language : you press some situations or feelings from that often are very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ en@@ able words are well known today ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are located in a special culture deep ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ re@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all contradi@@ cting every attempt by a simple translation .
a word , or an expression is not enough to understand why a full explanation and sometimes a lot of context are needed to understand exactly what is meant to this word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a whole time .
most of these lists were in Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from Van@@ u@@ atu and Van@@ u@@ atu , as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ ü@@ h you for your parents in recognition , how to have worked in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The ease of ease or fi@@ ess , who is to feel , after you walked to cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they practic@@ ing other cultures , revealed other kind of thought and check our new sh@@ alling yards .
sometimes you influence the world by us , and classified the lingu@@ ist on this page would like to release more of these &quot; unbe@@ atable &quot; words , and there are different , valuable and impressive in these small languages .

after a statement by the disaster of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and killed almost hundreds of people because of the river and Schl@@ amm@@ la@@ win@@ ches .
for more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure day of residence .
the rainf@@ alls took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water resi@@ sts in some areas were slowly back .
health and hygienic containers of the population provide a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give a impression of the extent of flood cat@@ astrophe :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with aqu@@ es of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka provide regular updates to high water situation .

use on the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with neighboring friend .
I trusted you my four @-@ year old daughter she tru@@ sts to me her children ; she is my rock in bran@@ ching .
in one minute , we call for the rights of women .
in the next door , we use the rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain@@ umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographi@@ cally picture of a woman with head @-@ cloth , bound from a American flag , other channels t@@ apped par@@ olen against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girl@@ friend look at me and said , &quot; This things does not do you , or ? &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? , &quot; question me .
I have already led this entertainment already .
people with whom I work or people who have been working for many years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who they know it - from the widely used concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built itself in its presentation .
you won against me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we cannot show all the same .
we practic@@ ing our religion .
in order to be able to be Muslim at different art . but somehow we will be placed all of the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
these dra@@ wers are so well constructed in our collective presentation such as Muslims who like Muslims who are not fit there .
di@@ ctions will be Muslim .
I have not been doing it alone .
this is even the po@@ ets , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures come to one in the sense if you think of him ?
love ?
what is peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i as old , as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and scholars .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day , where he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western presentation , religion Ru@@ mis deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this sol@@ ete makes a big part of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another of other exists in the re@@ ac@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , Western books have been colonial since centuries .
this ver@@ itable image language is determined by the dark man , the one should be afraid , and the exotic woman who should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid has cut the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but those pictures do not even look ahead today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood .
for three years , I worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ rative has dominated our News@@ flash .
this nar@@ ra@@ tiv , the reality , which have led to nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the US was not able to el@@ ect her first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ra@@ ctive failed to recognize that if French , Muslim women are involved in public buildings and su@@ di Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which are both by two of the same Medal .
a powerful group committed to his &quot; Control &quot; on the other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ ping down Muslim women who lead the movements for change .
it also looks like that the first Muslim Brotherhood were spoken on American soil , which were hi@@ ked to slavery .

this nar@@ ra@@ tiv has become so deep and faul@@ ts so that often Si@@ kh @-@ Men and the children of an@@ tim@@ ulus attacks and schi@@ zophren@@ ia are occupied .
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way , in which we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia are not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
part of the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories about stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry is sag@@ gy to capture the nar@@ ra@@ tiv of 1.7 billion .
and we are mel@@ ted here , where seven million Muslims took place in the highest degree of religious group in America .
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigration of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my one had arrived in New York to live in order to live their American dream .
my mother has her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers from New York ; sky@@ scra@@ per is possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan joined the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ disturbed and Americans .
but I now have been in@@ um@@ ed Muslims and Americans ?
sometimes , when I ask people , why I have no pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ shake , all Muslim at themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I have sh@@ ear , we do not bear all T@@ asch@@ enk@@ or@@ ans with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always be chosen for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholar , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists , who strive to combat far from Islam through Islam .
these lies are produced at the current band of a well @-@ winning Islam@@ opho@@ bes , think tank , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is our faul@@ ty image , which is a Muslim ; or what is Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the species , in which we tell it , is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stran@@ ger , who pre@@ ached the head .

I would like to explain .
I was born as Muslims , but had been born as Muslims , but when I was born four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist of religious life describe them back to the following terms : think , behavior , and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girl@@ friend , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in Bran@@ ch , that I am born as Muslims , when it could look through the 15 @-@ meter @-@ concrete and air that could separate our houses .
she would like to see it with my daughter , if I put them in my arms , and you have called the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I re@@ counted three times every day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I therefore said that it is protected against E@@ vil the E@@ vil / E@@ vil the E@@ vil / E@@ vil the E@@ vil / E@@ vil the E@@ vil .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim names , history four times more reported than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer meeting , the Az@@ aan , was called for an fre@@ ed black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic scholar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad is lav@@ ted , and in this country .
it means , Mal@@ col@@ m X is a American hero .

one American scholar , a Pakist@@ ani , an army teacher , a mart@@ y@@ ari , a Muslims and a journalist means that inherent @-@ time interventions were acci@@ dentally acci@@ dentally acci@@ dentally , but to communicate them to others .

a mother said to be a mother to ensure my child and all Muslim children , knowing that power@@ full and privileged individuals on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is composed in the Muslim Brotherhood which began with President Bush and , under President Obama .
they are in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is located in the emi@@ gration , which takes a five @-@ year old child .
it is in a country that surro@@ unds the borders of people from just over the countries that bom@@ bed the borders .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ letin &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is mainly Arabs and Muslims .
it &apos;s the wars that we lead and the bombs which we ab@@ duc@@ ed to Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and due to those who we don &apos;t tell us today , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University were an scientifically described image and made them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the least score points .
Con@@ vers@@ ations , which we have to lead
we are too deep , to be a Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our changing , and the faul@@ ty , dangerous and dangerous prints , which we are in our news @-@ au@@ ctions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , which tries to capture our multiple con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis acci@@ dentally and forgotten history .

there is a reason for that pl@@ ess of the@@ or@@ the@@ or@@ ti@@ cian that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House run .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have made Muslims in &quot; other . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , where it has created the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier it had not been given until they were not allowed to Iraq they have great territories in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware , when I was so old , as it &apos;s now my daughter , but I have made me today at an in@@ um@@ ed Muslims .
things I leave here like a bre@@ ads track in my speech .
things that perhaps memories are w@@ ling , because in all the interest rates that our humanity is , like a story where someone made a &quot; other . &quot;
just now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations took place in the framework of the 8th J@@ ähr@@ st Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .

why can I see here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , who has shown to us how war has led and people through the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades in the scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to present themselves un@@ qu@@ ent issues according to the role of the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have a new future - which we have no President , the chocolate of the chocolate , while it was broken down , while he was broken down to other &quot; people , and goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .

the initiative of stories wants to preserve urban voice diversity
history count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can it be possible to give it possible , here and now , despite a language barrier with somebody ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in its original language , is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently over a other initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ en@@ able Blog .
however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written , but on the spoken word . it is a try to get the language selection of great cities and to recognize them .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land , the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the new@@ born children .
to this project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we create cities , diversity , and safe rooms , in which inhabitants are not forgotten , who are in order to be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand these events instead , &quot; the confidence to estimate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , orchestra will present their history in their own language , and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants have no professional skill counter , their de@@ vo@@ tion and their account , the audience will be able to draw the audience .
simply call laugh@@ ter and emotions , when the language does not show a barrier in longer than a barrier .
the following video shows such a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which will be told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this lap , the story of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate was also the opportunity to explain its country typical customs of stories .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ ara tells the fork out of the H@@ asen and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona , Zimbabwe :
after he asked the importance of His f@@ light@@ ness , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how to speak to a audience , that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a widths , he shares his feeling of the incub@@ ation :
you have heard !
they were plenty of attention ...
they were quite near me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project , can organize with T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own interests .
Puerto Rico , calls for the state school of the United States .
on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started in the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ fic Capit@@ ol , the government buildings of the capital city , and from the city , to the Plaza de Col@@ ón , in the town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the ne@@ ural meeting of debt ) and the German Assembly of Puerto Ri@@ cos .
in addition , the care of the new translation of the United States have also submitted an Peti@@ tion on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos calls that politicians , volumes and government agencies , which are responsible for the debts , are responsible for their corruption .
we request a financial assessment and an assessment committee without personal interests to the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which is active in favor of the economy .
we are pres@@ tige and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos ref@@ uses to pay a guil@@ t which is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found in dro@@ pping pension@@ ers .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state @-@ owned territory of the United States - was suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party leaders , a law on the socio @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos require a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
from the exterior , measures will be imposed without the Parti@@ cipation and the conviction for the citizens of the people who can be rejected by the people .
the demonstration was named &quot; Nach@@ tw@@ guard for Light and Truth . &quot;

the sy@@ ri@@ cally Palestinian developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is also known for over a year .
it is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , he set up his support and members of the campaign for his freedom , and recall the contributions which he took place for an open grid .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , who held annually the annual conference for digital culture , which is aligned in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ h@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ sini , scientist at Book Spr@@ ints , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the Book of Freedom of Freedom : A Colle@@ ctive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The cost of Freedom : a collective rep@@ lica ) from three to five days .
the book , which was released last year and is freely available , and contains a number of inser@@ ts , dealing with free culture in the face of suppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction :
this book would like to read how movements for free knowledge and what the true cost will be connected to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designer , developers , researcher and authors , who have been involved in the movements for freedom knowledge , have left side to see about the ne@@ b@@ ula , which gives our news@@ feeds and create a bit sense of our experience .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers since March 15 , 2012 in Syria .
his name was released from the A@@ dra @-@ prison camp , in which he was sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have since made no information about its current state or position .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory is his friends and his family a voice which , to his release , and who want him to know him in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel has paid a high price for its participation in a free culture , has many of us begin to re@@ think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what do we decided to do ?
what do we leave in this process of time extreme over@@ arching ?
since March 2012 the Web@@ developer for Open Source and Digital activist is a military government since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was born from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and attorney N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the military police Bas@@ sel reported on basis of one of &quot; strictly appointed &quot; by the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that , on November 12 , 2015 , G@@ ha@@ zi reported people who had been cont@@ acted by people himself as In@@ si@@ der of the Assad government and they were aware of an alleged death penalty against her husband .
but his residence and condition remain still unknown .
a pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in order to extend the access to the Internet and understanding for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , designer , Technolo@@ ge and currently over@@ clo@@ cked the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bas@@ sel founded in Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of the bass prototypes were pre@@ hen@@ sive as the factory that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the way of how many civi@@ liz@@ ations and the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ core traditions and Persian influences .
in the time , Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would all set up this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ans but the world em@@ bodied .
this sli@@ pping into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capaci@@ tive , which will be the public for the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value .
in fact , Bas@@ sel could not close this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life in order to dream of liberty and bas@@ sel taught me to poor poor .
I have been overwhel@@ med when I left his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he had already been in detention .
I learned to read English well , to read and speak .
he has always dealt with any knowledge , which has asked if he has taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me , both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also brought the other def@@ endants , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without theory that actually stopped one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( War@@ ten ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote in detention in 2012 to 2015 , when he was in detention .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for a year .
she made her text to him , when they visited him , and he put it from the Arab to English .
the book is free @-@ free .

it happens during every visit ,
in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I left the occupying in the moment , in which we moved to us .

Bass@@ els History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against the regime Bashar al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( sy@@ r@@ isches Network for Human Rights ) have gone more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or executed by the regime disappeared , were tortured or executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique k : because of Cor@@ ruption , condem@@ n the director of a warrant for arrest warran@@ ts back .
Mos@@ ambique &apos;s re@@ acted to wrath on a corruption , in which a government member after half of his sentence was returned to work in the State apparatus , to which the corruption was committed .
this was arrested by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants in 2010 ( about 800 000 euros ) for 22 years .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za was appointed between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to a good guided tour and demanded his re@@ setting to the company , what happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office , which allow the application to refer the application , there was no obstacles to refer to Cam@@ ba@@ za , back to his old post as the company was not represented after his prison .
however , many inhabitants are not good .
the center for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution , uses for public transparency , sentenced to an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision to set up the company again in an interview :
represents a return in the fight against corruption and clear , the lack of transparency and is even a step in view to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we assume , that the company should have agreed to enter a disciplinary committee in the case of a disciplinary trade agreement .
however , it seems to be true , however , does not seem to appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding features .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the mos@@ et of social media , reiter@@ ate this behaviour and considered the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison in prison and half of them .
he could play lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and his image pol@@ ishing .
but when he was in@@ competent , he has made it to be integrated into the company which he helped damage to harm .
hence it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be paid for his silence .
resistance !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique &apos;s and student of Political Science in Brazil , says the director of no Mor@@ al , said :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he didn &apos;t let him think I cannot be rewarded to such a way , who has already ins@@ ulting the state already so massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing the mor@@ ality and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but instead only served on the state only .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state , as a handy source of money , and the state itself had become tired of this man who finally charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Fran@@ ce@@ y Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a Di@@ eb belonged to the prison :
Di@@ ebe belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , who will not only remain the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - following - A Proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to be able to sell the pat@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so much . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not work from his ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is de@@ crimin@@ als at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was sentenced to 10 years and came free .
and today it is the company at which he took advantage of money again , again under contract . # Assi@@ m@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Family Buil@@ dings ( @ az@@ o _ Raf@@ ik ) will be held on 12 May 2017 .

Facebook blocks the rass@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and zen@@ es many users to un@@ quite
the bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ se or sp@@ aw@@ se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their podium out of the net because they had the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word will still be discussed , it is normally used to refer to humans East Indian origin , or general as Ad@@ jek@@ tiv &quot; In@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ gers ) as part of an initiative to tackle the far spread problem of Hass@@ i in Burma in the social network .
in the last few years , the ascent of radi@@ al @-@ nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ stain consistency .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as Hass@@ elt , which is a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaning@@ ful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ mag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is usually brought together with rac@@ ism in connection , but the word that is not automatically ad@@ mits through Hass@@ ismus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , or doubts have to be expressed in order in order to have the expression of his work .
moreover , there are several bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic different mean@@ ings , which are the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ mes@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter , as well as other words as &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ j@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cyte A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various translations of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was done today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends to spiritual kind , whether they could we@@ arer , as he could be his back pain , where he made a word game .
the set ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ ing ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ isch - resembles a rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
various reactions were on the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ un is the opinion that they will reduce radi@@ cally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must be certain , before it is to spread all Po@@ sts of sol@@ der to spread the suspicion of Rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; is not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automatic set is not understand what you do on Facebook .
what should make it instead , the post is carefully sent to analyse and check it to check the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( chair ) .
the good thing is that this three @-@ leg@@ ged nation@@ alists who spread Hass@@ elt , a rather good lesson .
now it is at the time to compl@@ ain nation@@ alism .
while the action will send a strong signal to all , the Hass@@ ase may spread the efficiency of this strategy .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven to begin to begin social networks , to create a new word , or an alternative writing of the zen@@ ge word , to get their views to their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his podium when he only wanted to announce his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new gui@@ del@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends , that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ less my Post was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; Facebook community is not consistent . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts from humans , which have no negative inten@@ tions or the just try to show their opinions against the Hass@@ elt radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed , nothing has to do with h@@ assi related language :
to address the Facebook page without h@@ osti@@ lities .
in the post office , the author presented his opinion about , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious locality are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook will have to do more about the initiative of the initiative , for example the bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community around Rat :
Facebook may have a well @-@ s@@ wollen intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
such words gets to play , only more hatred will bring in the different communities .
in addition , it seems to have started using this without local context or technical support , and as such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot;
even as they found out that they did not have any mistakes , they did not appear to dis@@ sol@@ ete Po@@ sts .
if they could only have a little bit , respect for the 15 million benefit , which would give them a great turnover , the great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has provided by a lot of fun under the users .
rather than to take it seriously , users have fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not to see the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ i to see if their podium will be taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which is not mist@@ aken , but nevertheless not removed :
permission was used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and a her@@ b@@ cur@@ ry eat and a Indian film .
only to try out , if Facebook contains the mail , the word of Kal@@ ar contains . &quot;
screen@@ shot , with permission used .
the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , healing people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , with permission used .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist Ide@@ ologies and religious fun@@ ament@@ alism , social networks have used to expand their voices and its influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt , in social networks and violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands of flee .
Facebook was intended to say to his bur@@ m@@ ese sides , to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than just read the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to migr@@ ate than in the context of a code of concentrated initiatives and learned by them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end with the children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s children is home to Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the country of the country has unanim@@ ously decided to offer this practice , so that the hei@@ g@@ able age now lies at 18 .
prior to this change in the E@@ he@@ Act , a number of religious religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , the leaders of the religious organisation ( IR@@ O ) said that the State representatives of the various religious groups said that the state did not appear to act , since that , age not the maturity interest . &quot;
this happened to be explained that Trinidad and Tobago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN child &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors as one , every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who had already been married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent in Trinidad and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Central Office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements who came to for@@ bid the laws of the child , followed by great support , followed by the foot and fre@@ ed great support . undoubtedly , they have made this outcome .
nevertheless , not all are smooth .
a Hin@@ du guide , Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of the children &apos;s actions , they ought to ev@@ ap@@ t their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was amaz@@ ed for vol@@ tages in this simple thing , and sometime there came doubt whether the opposition would agree to all in the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was approved for the Children &apos;s before - despite the 4 Sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the Opposition and an independent , that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where it would be a simple majority to make him the law .
now , only the president of the country will be able to agree to the law of the country .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave to Facebook a status update that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill was against the Children &apos;s House in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of the only one against it .
after gradu@@ ating earlier in the Senate , the design can now be appointed to the law .
the majority of social media users had been thrilled because the laws have been changed for children before finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who offered a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has a lot of time and un@@ iting Ger@@ ede that has got the core of the thing , but you know what ? the children &apos;s children is in Trinidad and Tobago now has been illegal , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while Abel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to finish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ ke News !
the E@@ he@@ Law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 - 0 ! ! ! ! !
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , is an ordinary social group that talked on the law as important to the adoption of the law , noted :
the heat @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious group 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment to the E@@ he@@ Act was today decided on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives : 41 MP and of them were present at the vote .
all ME@@ Ps , who were against the law , voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s days is not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # 1 .
many thanks to all activists that have rede@@ emed him .
congratulations .
a Dan@@ ke to our ME@@ Ps .
but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj guilty of his intention to rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ited steps to company , should be passed by the law , and he seems to dis@@ solve his promise .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General al @-@ Ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of law , said it is quite right when Mahar@@ aj guilty to the law that most social media users , one would go the debate on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed before :
dear Sat , if we want to talk about the problem , in a way that we could talk about the state , that it might be of great , hard @-@ to @-@ the men that they may be used against them in the benefit , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or believe that there is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places around the world where the children &apos;s work is legally valid or continue to the norm , though it is laws to say they are .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s local news service Yar@@ News announced that it was cra@@ cked on Sunday .
by the spi@@ es of websites , Turkish users can view again Wikipedia content .
the English page on January 18 , 2012 , mutual to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Act of the United States , is internationally ev@@ okes .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month , Turkey popular and popular in the crowd sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia .
the day for users will be clear how important the platform for users is to be useful as well as reliable information , and share more information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are against the sper@@ m .
although many techniques were used to use internet websites ( a current article by the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most of the common Wikipedia users don &apos;t fall in this category .
although Turkey has been locked in an article by Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was passed .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous land in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be closed , several Mir@@ ror pages ( pages , which are often updated to the content of Wikipedia ) and are often updated .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. , calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is based on the system of domain name , thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship .
the content is also available in spite of the legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post reported IP@@ FS via its efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( about the sper@@ m from Wikipedia ) , we have everything that sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so it &apos;s possible to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and in the way .
this can help the users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ d@@ org yourself .
IP@@ FS also received that this step was carried out independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is just around screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia were involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the Sper@@ re .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has a Mir@@ ror site of Wikipedia , as well as the Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use similar Mir@@ ror to ho@@ sts if in each country Wikipedia are locked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as employees at Mozilla at Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open 1959 &apos; Pod@@ cast :
it is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you go on a different URL , which is not the original . what you see , is from Wikipedia .
basically , the server runs on request for the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content from Wikipedia itself , if they are locked in Turkey .
this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer is used to make his camera to make the need for natural protection .
a su@@ hl@@ ess Nash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo from Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never before . they were disappeared with bad positioning of mo@@ tive colours and balanced colours .
that motivated him a camera to wear and try to bear the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar himself had to bring to the international stage at the age of 28 .
and his hometown is right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , this offers the perfect opportunity to shoot photos to shoot with the attention of Nep@@ als and wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps with his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world nature heritage . what could give it better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I rested in the home of Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my Father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a Leopard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I finished with my camera and was in a handful of minutes there .
my father had seen him , and showed me the place on the other river , where the Leopard was found and I started immediately , pictures to tri@@ p@@ sen ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als , and would like to make understanding the understanding that wild animals are not such as fur@@ ry , as they look like they look like .
and he should know it , because he had already stood out from the face to face :
a tiger can not be heard by the opinion of sheep not at sleep ! !
late evening . the light is weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared in the house . he immediately went immediately , we see at and he star@@ red me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) to his photos .
its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als nature and game is not always simple .
he was waiting for 22 days , and lived in a tent in order to make a tiger in the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days , until he took a tiger that he took home and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

after the wedding car , Indian women was for the first time to discuss the name of their hus@@ bands .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization in India .
a revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing Agreement .
in many parts , women avoid women with the greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even of older men in the family .
instead , they use a P@@ ron@@ omen or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pradesh to give women to comp@@ ut@@ ate her husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should obtain the norm of the age .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a , convicted by their family and the village community , after she had married a secret relatives with names .
the tradition , wives will not call their wives , too , is also common in men . however , they have much less damage to fear if all that , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health sper@@ son@@ al and house@@ wives , a unique club in and were quickly became the main subject of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss the enemies of the patri@@ arch@@ ate &apos;s enemies and discuss .
when one of 56 clubs , which is available in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ Hel@@ icop@@ al &apos;s campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and uses the degradation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ers .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works with the help of her video am@@ era for seven years , with the help of their video am@@ era , including children &apos;s rights to the Association of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and manages these clubs .
they reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for those women and have made it at the same time on bot@@ t inside of the wall .
the first video , showed Roh@@ ini in their discussion round , was the name of women who did not call their hus@@ bands .
she decided on this topic for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can identify easily .
the names of their hus@@ bands didn &apos;t leave the name of their hus@@ bands , they have not guilty to all the dem@@ n@@ ity of their liability .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition has testi@@ fied that a woman and her husband , and he wishes a long life .
a woman who does not appear , is regarded as a l@@ isti@@ g , as woman without Mor@@ al .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought up to this discussion .
at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband until now , had never called her name , at home , how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my father @-@ in @-@ law and my husband had a long time after the video was at the end .
intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I was to call him from his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first Dis@@ cussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed it had a good thing , as it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pradesh .
after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in course .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , ref@@ uses , sad , aff@@ ection@@ ately and so on .
then she asked them , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they call us how they want , means that they don &apos;t matter ?
shouldn &apos;t be the same ? &quot;
some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to leave their hus@@ bands on her husband &apos;s name , &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was born out of the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , who had never noticed the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so sh@@ y , that they had just escaped from the exercise , and another decided to leave the whole strike against him and his family to allow him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ rush order , with an ancient Br@@ asses , the women decided to try to try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they stopped their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what they put the women into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t hear his name to say his name .
another club member chose to do it at the dinner time before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she did , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I would do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in this was less , delicate , and the situation of violence in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports that women have tried to stop other practices , such as the interest of the gal@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head , which shows the adul@@ ter@@ atus :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point when it would also be done .
he only took the eighth and I heard it to carry him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion club is a saf@@ er place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we are a excursion to every Dis@@ cussion club .
usually , we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make sure that those who could hear what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in her life , with cakes ; they danced and s@@ angen over things that had never had never thought before they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini said :
I &apos;ve been working for many years , and I have been working for many years for many years , for example as our Identi@@ ties at our hus@@ bands are still not so honest .
it does not feel great to say some things according to say , no matter how small they would like to have a occurrence .
in a discussion panel , we have informed about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have been worn only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , the okay , but some wanted to have a sal@@ u @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt of a sh@@ orts , they don &apos;t have to be shared .
after a lot of war and discussion on the advantages of his own hang@@ ers , the Mor@@ al associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , mu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini of their own pair of Kur@@ dish ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear and Roh@@ ini can be sure to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since her first discussion board , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things come slowly to the roles :
we have only made small steps .
some women have had a few times , but we heard again to say the name of their hus@@ bands .
some , including me , don &apos;t make me , but only if they are alone and don &apos;t have any other family members .
only one or two say to the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women have now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their fore@@ head .
the women in Dis@@ cussion club know that the changes that they want to accompl@@ ish in their lives - like the f@@ ishers in order to get more motion or &apos;s own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river .
by adding each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini stated :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too . I am too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction , if any woman goes back home and other people talk about what we talk , and what we do .
we sit on all in the same boat .

however , China will still receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winners and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Liu X@@ ia , to allow him a treatment abroad .
some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ red on the theme .
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations

the diplomatic relations has continued again in December last year , Norway signed a agreement to come back to China in June , Norway and the exports have been blocked for China since 2010 .
after the message was common that Liu was serious , the Nobel Peace committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release for an expression and invited Liu , to pick his prize in Oslo .

a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency to liber@@ ate the Chinese authorities , not only Liu , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia of her house arrest .
the request of the US Embassy drew a political answer to China , with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to participate in the right and ir@@ responsible remarks by Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , for example , travel policy and access to medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore is a city or a land ?
the question might appear dum@@ b , as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam should be considered city as a city .
this re@@ mark has been triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of a meeting in the international branch of the Association of New York , the Minister of New York noted that many people critic@@ ise the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries .
it is supporting that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has put in question whether New York had a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , whereby most people go an error .
I have tried to declare that we are different .
we are a town .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ erio acc@@ using the Minister of Justice in order to defend &quot; logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and resolutions , that valuable land to create that valuable land , let &apos;s say that we had to be any country .
it is so volcanic , it had the call of a flight before the responsibilities , a compulsory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my country , you eat land ?
the reasons of Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ vers : he defended an idea to measure the political system of Singapore , not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which it seemed un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore was compared to the cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities , which are permanent party of a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the river , the good old cor@@ er of the author@@ itative Mach@@ th@@ ab@@ ern , who pre@@ fers to give demo@@ crats , leave out logic as they fit better to their power .
in the final week , in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam , answers to its American guests in regard to our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions are clo@@ cked with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls to Shan@@ mu@@ gam to his opinion , as they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ lowed .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to whom the country belongs to the city ...
shortly , I understand nothing .
I would have been grat@@ eful when our beloved K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would like to clari@@ fy this point where he was paid up to this point in order to be part of the city &apos;s government .
by writing on the blog , he has published his comment on the blog , in order to read that the full tran@@ script of the conference will read better , in order to understand the context of statements by Shan@@ mu@@ gam , to which Singapore will be a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
he said that Singapore is rather one &quot; city &quot; be regarded as a country , &quot; said why the elections in Singapore was so low , even if we are still free and just another elections .
he was able to win Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities were able to win a party ? ) .
when he said , Singapore &quot; was not a land , he did not turn it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an displays its dis@@ appointment over Shan@@ mu@@ gam , which makes it as leader of a small @-@ growing generation .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to spend ...
at least , I was with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which is expected me - I should agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure whether he believed that it is really associated , and it is aware of what he is def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review broken the vulner@@ ability of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
has Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; has committed a mistake &quot; or was there a joy of joy ?
if Singapore is no country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of Singapore city ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
because he plays an important role within the government &apos;s cable , the testimon@@ ies of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam of serious importance .
why are the people of Singapur to their military service , they defend their city but not their land ?
if you have to pay our Prime Minister accounts ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
that &apos;s the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ ing , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I did not told what I told &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have many people &apos;s more expensive ...
no one has told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a town .
we were always a city / is@@ let state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I understand that we often understand how &quot; the defence of the country mainly &quot; etc . &quot; , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should say rather of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; net@@ worked Canadian &quot;

screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices , recently asked his editors : what is the most viol@@ ated aspect of your home or home ?
its responses are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another Fac@@ ette should be shown here .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that will be laid on most in Japan , is : &quot; you are Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; response I then . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation , the conversation is taking place , it is considered to be a cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his speech by using personal questions .
in my clear address , the default response is usually : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadian , perhaps inner to W@@ ut , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t leave me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little , that differs from the Americans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans will bring an Canadian flag good to their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand , however , ...
so it was already 20 years ago when I started to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before returning to Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian have always been worn around small A@@ hor@@ n@@ als on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons !
even since 2005 , Canada has been legally required since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we say very often &quot; exc@@ use &quot; . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as such as these types south of the border .
we are nice .
I hate it .
first of all , I have made a lot of American friends I &apos;m very wonderful .
it would not be nothing , if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
together with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; kind . &quot;
first of : as &quot; kind &quot; is called to be called for &quot; a kind , gentle , but most important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double management ) .
when Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step towards the front . but the actual problem is that &quot; kind &quot; has no personality . &quot;
there are no corners and edges , nothing , at which one can be done .
harm@@ less , that means in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting , and not deser@@ ve attention to deser@@ ve .
this can be something good when you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote view from the things that happen around a week .
I would even go far as far , say that the desire , free , and alone , is a major ship of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what an external &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool just cool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadian talk not often about the fence of the neighbours .
we are missing the hot , open kindness , which I now work with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au was the stage to show that Kan@@ adi@@ ans more than only &quot; kind . &quot; our Prime Minister has experienced a sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video , that the j@@ unta &apos;s power took power , and despite its refusal to restore civilian government , continues to restore the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( Pha@@ det Girl ) , the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who told him his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly stated politically , the music video plays on the sustained military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users to describe their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , it was divided on Facebook highly charged video 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; was even blocked by the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin video . &quot; the dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand , after a group of activists returned to the public to view this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics as well , in particular , how it keeps the position of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
check out this pictures of the videos that relate to some of the political issues , which have persecuted Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 &apos; rules of girls &quot; refer to the dra@@ fting section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which included the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision about important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your setup &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; manufacturing change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons accused of a critic .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer science , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations often util@@ ised by the authorities to overthrow activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content is monitored , and persons accused of having accused the monarchy of the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Star ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy their decision expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a waste of tax .
in the video , it will be shown to be thrown into a black vans , before you go into an inter@@ ni@@ fication bearing , another problem .
some journalists sitting in prison because she allegedly caused confusion &quot; in society because they have caused confusion &quot; in society and they are threatened for a long time , they ought to leave the monarchy .

villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Kh@@ arch@@ il@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ massage area of Ab@@ ch@@ r@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Repub@@ lics , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area together .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and di@@ alo@@ es are living in the area .
such settlements are also called Gei@@ ster@@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ ol@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there are more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this gh@@ ost cities .
this is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the overall population of the population had risen in 16@@ ,000 people , after over a decade ago .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

everything is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can talk with you ? &quot; why ?
however , it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who were all of the community .
now , there is only paved road with infl@@ ated Pra@@ ise buildings .

two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of an destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they go back immediately .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to us that we are looking for us , &quot; says one of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s everything &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl enjoys a little bit too and suddenly abandoned the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .

you can use everything for everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
actually , it has actually nothing to do with platinum .
after the war there was hardly work and all lived like them quite .
I remember that day , as the city and the war had once been once . &quot;
when our conversation shi@@ fted to us at the end , a little boy was over to us .
it runs through the window of a destructive building .
a ball flies away from the window and another boy j@@ agt to him .
he plays with the ball , then covered the hill .
a group of children , now turn the ball .
while they run , some of them are stones on the burned building .
these ruins are part of her childhood that ensure un@@ ners in her life .
they do not know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama is home to &quot; Mama @-@ Africa &quot; on their long journey
Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org website and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is directed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a little woman with a cor@@ als of pink glasses and golden ear ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ bears form .
she is the Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many among the name of Mama @-@ Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a goal of Afri@@ kaner and Hai@@ tian , who has become a destination on the journey .
the hotel has no longer charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 per night , the guests can sleep in simple rooms , with sink , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance there is a par@@ rots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ posts to the hotel , but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama @-@ Africa !
where are you Mama @-@ Africa ? . &quot;
currently it is more quiet , but in this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some of some have already sle@@ pt outside .
they would like to reject anyone .
they also helps them , and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they purchased them , they do not pay to pay them with a bal@@ m away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him to see whether Mama were a reasonable name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has one Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ard ) of the Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , with the Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I feel that it fits to her , as African women are very nice .
very carefully .
it has the heart of a mother ...
we are very pleased here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston , to get there to her husband and the three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ kaner churches which are on the way into the United States , to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north .
the family had heard from other towns of Mama in Africa . &quot; Mama @-@ Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest made from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans were traveling along the route and that the Afri@@ cans speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his way he has lived Michel@@ et previously in Brazil and has worked as a building workers for the Olympic Games and the football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at m@@ um Africa : he sells SI@@ M cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I qu@@ ery him whether he will contact us in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez contact .
&quot; Mama @-@ Africa is our mother and we let them go back , &quot; said he ridi@@ cul@@ ously . &quot; we will always remain in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests will send their often text to send her , if they have gone to gre@@ ek , or tell her about the course of their journey .
it explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought their place , chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only radio of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valencia .
in this winter , Valencia and his family took place in their little house in their little house .
he is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus tickets can be sold to numerous African immigrants .
he started to help them , a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar .
at the moment 25 persons , mostly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep on ceilings at the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can go through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we had suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . this is the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was assass@@ inated after a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova mel@@ én@@ dez is told me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children of people , who wanted to kill him money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked after an accommodation and a well @-@ known ones , an all @-@ stone , has offered her roof .
a few months later , the family lives still , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways , the travellers need to consult your phones to travelers .
a small bus is now arrived and has 20 new guests , a lot of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but it is also the nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she sh@@ ook it in their album with many photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ eing which has made a client in some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old .
she laugh@@ ed , while she pushed me shortly before .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats every time every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users have been tested by Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , to install a cell notification in which the district government has to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
in the report , the app is said to get access to terrorist information on terrorist information . &quot;
however , k@@ ò@@ n@@ in@@ thia the authorities also use the app for more than fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because she was installed shortly after they had replaced the app .
in the notification of the police the app provided the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and track that together with &quot; illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Tel@@ ecom .
the main function is the block@@ age web pages , of online fraud , pun@@ ches and ph@@ ased @-@ pages to make users looking forward how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this app is for min@@ ors for min@@ ors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can be used in many different ways .
for example , the remote control &quot; state players or even h@@ acker could be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal it .
it is in line with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region .
while mel@@ odic over digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the east and south , is the reality very often dunes for those who live in remote , ur@@ ged ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit its un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often require extreme zinc and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ inely , internet off @-@ off .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( so far ) , the zen@@ ith messages published in China , displayed photos of a check@@ point where the residents of the people &apos;s most un@@ aud@@ ited to the polic@@ emen as they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian is sure that the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
if you have discovered a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a return for technological development .
they are forced to use them , devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity to w@@ att@@ ested by .
we returned back to Ma@@ os China .
in addition , &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( so far ) , in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which means that the software should be able to lift the password for a Windows operating system , and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones into X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang an electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party , the dissem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government @-@ two , authorities and the party with related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on operation of its computer and communication devices .
a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is due to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and to destroy the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and there &apos;s no way for a whole range of other possible failure , including those who refer to the peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all sh@@ opper after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you don &apos;t want you and stell@@ ations that you are all in a place where it is all important .
everything has been dis@@ b@@ anded and has revealed a truth that clearly recogn@@ is@@ able , both from the inside and outside .
one that makes its name all the honor .
one , which is defeated in a list of feelings and expres@@ sively beaten that no met@@ aph@@ ors do not allow any met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you stop the reality again and you behind the scenes , beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the body - turn the characters in beings from meat and blood , and all sh@@ outs after death .
all doubt rede@@ em in smoke and you &apos;ll be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the Un@@ healed . you will be clear that you have been caught between the walls which are your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough , that I wasn &apos;t &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of safety , put it , with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he exhibited his power by us , by calling it even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we did so .
five you@@ ths were torn during a peaceful protests such as oun@@ ces of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to make the city the darkness of night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ en .
all city tours , just my own do not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ los , at the wrong time , even if I did not claim high demands on a city that , until the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and its compli@@ ments .
in the third night , the things ran a cal@@ ming , after the power supply had heard in the quarter .
I broke the silence by writing several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends got down enough to build up .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends from me : we delivered us to a beautiful picture that got my expectations fully and fulfilled .
in such a moment you will be aware that you are in the spirit from the lamp , but it is definitely not interested in the Ger@@ ing@@ est .
I received a call from my Father : &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military service buildings . &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you get to swal@@ low you - nothing can return your voice , after you have made your way up to the office of the security service of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak to speak , &quot; &quot; let me listen to me as you know &apos; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only courage to write enough , if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ met eyes were based on me .
&quot; and you have been aware of what I look at the eyes and not on the floor ! &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my tor@@ ness , E@@ it@@ el@@ ty ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was my thing in my thing when I answered , &quot; I have not thought that you have been forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think , I have never heard that you look at the eyes , so why should I do it ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me , and I don &apos;t have a word from what I said .
&quot; it is in retail and his father immediately with them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right along with &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tank of this ver@@ ge set is me until today in the nose .
he was exposed to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a lack of torture , which I was exposed to months .
I am crossing the farm .
in the first office I let all return , what I &apos;m sorry for me .
then again , through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I pre@@ ge all the details just before I made the room .
otherwise , they have dealt with a larger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one single prisoners , and may immediately set me immediately without their permission .
after a few minutes that , as a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went down to a familiar communication method : with the Faust on the wall .
I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ gen@@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ sth@@ enden ling . &quot;
finally , after a long time he answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was an outstanding man @-@ aged ages that looks like me and called &quot; doctor &quot; .
in the perfect darkness they can &apos;t recognize any striking facial features , and doctors have not exist here ; we are all numbers on the numbers .
&quot; perhaps someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers leads to one of his existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the major cells .
perhaps he is immediately interro@@ gated .
the investig@@ ators had as@@ sures me , they would give him free@@ way , when I am going .
Lü@@ g@@ ner .
if I have had a bird @-@ ch@@ ill , to distribute all these herbs , that is lab@@ elled at the fruits of my head @-@ lab@@ es .
out of the distance , I hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always with these times , the terror , every day .
the door opens .
I was always confident that Schwarz saw the color of the Ver@@ ily , until I saw the yellow light , which brought us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; Rec@@ ording to 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to hear interro@@ gated . &quot;
that was the mystery of us to protect us , and to prevent the state security of us , and tell us that we speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - thus they played their in@@ denom@@ in@@ ational card and put the close eye field of its world view .
this is not a house that here is not a land ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to turn the crime of her c@@ lans into a hero .
I went to the ver@@ tically and faithful at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least , he comes so before .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; con@@ vers@@ ation , despite the face of face , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start with your life when you join this diary , and to protest demonstrations , which will soon be found soon . &quot;
I did not answered .
I have made it ordinary , not to reply .
I really can &apos;t say more accurate , when Bel@@ ei@@ tic and bat after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary communication for me .
when it happened , was unknown .
any voice in me , I said that I had to cast me or evil before it was pun@@ ished , even though I had done anything to earn this sentence .
at sentence in all of their diversity .
his order is to ri@@ p me so much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which is probably from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker erg@@ s.@@ ed to your write .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can not return your terror .
my Schre@@ ie fell not enough for him , and why they were able to exchange the tube by a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked me whether the investig@@ ators had been working as a waste collection , or whether it was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present us , from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them changed three of them , while I was still going to the series .
I had lost all my body in my body - and even my voice , which I heard up too .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling and found a skir@@ mish at all , which is why he is as one of an electric loaded handle .
electricity through my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi@@ n@@ ack@@ ers , the stretched on the ground was the perfect power manager .
the Tau@@ ern disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he met his sentence for this night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself back to sleep . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went to me , who came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the early light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
I am ans@@ wering with the voice of an exhaus@@ tive young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make aw@@ ake wor@@ ried . &quot;
be quiet and get away you , you &apos;ll need . &quot;
this was new .
they have always released me .
where they run me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spoke about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , free oppos@@ ing and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b rau@@ ry a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b carries out the majority of his time inside ; time he fired on his screen , time to his computer , and again at his couch .
but what can be left , you can discover a cigarette between his finger or his Nico@@ tin lips .
he lives in the top of his family house , which has been part of the West Bank since 1967 ; and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs had been forced to bear his family from her village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is an passionate activist , who is the conservative majority , and its ancient origins of gender mainstre@@ aming , sexu@@ ality and free oppos@@ ing through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , often be@@ ating with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world . all these issues can not be found only in his hometown of Amman , but also in cities in Damascus , from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as a someone who are not limited in his thinking , and it is according to their own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he is not open , he turns against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b viewed his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b believes that his comp@@ assion of those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , anything with his identity than &quot; Palestinian poultry , &quot; he was born , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own life circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think , because I am a man , while he sol@@ dered the nest @-@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this period it is planned for Muslim , sunrise and sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also said that the public consumption of food was illegal during the Ram@@ adan .
obviously h@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness of how to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hand , a little bit with protest against Islam .
basically the hose lu@@ gs of coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of Kent @-@ cig@@ ette in the nose to the first line of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison among free sky , especially when one takes a look into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is simply to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - to drink not in prison during the Ram@@ adan water .
recently , the Ministry of Jordan has had a performance at the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some Parliament ordered the Islam@@ ist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexu@@ als of Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , speaks of the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and is the principal reason for the concert .
the MP and former press review of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN , that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many claim that the band &apos;s engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free oppos@@ ites in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which represents the ancient proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itative regime in the whole region .
in a public statement by M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of Human Rights , &quot; which continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should be probably not easy @-@ to @-@ calibr@@ ated rhet@@ oric , but in fact , a clear reality is clearly reflected in Jordan , which is clear in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b of traditional gender de@@ men , by putting his vision from the fate of Arab women , the vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs were up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost her life through the hands of those who have lost their lives .
in the past years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; was taken up - the un@@ official outside .
Human Rights Watch said that the number of Hon@@ mor@@ de in 2016 reached its cli@@ max . however , the number of honorary infrastructure is missing to support women who tried to have victims , murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for un@@ interrup@@ tions from the year 1954 , women who have been arrested in prison for a certain period in prison , &quot; and for their release , often a years of bureaucra@@ tic effort , as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will do nothing happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs are delighted with great popularity and is well @-@ known that , too , not before issues , who are in his country long as tab@@ le@@ u g@@ ale .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b is alleged that his work was politically active , however , he has been one that he is his music , the full of explic@@ it encour@@ ages on sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , not from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says , &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; is the focus again in poverty .
the list of the songs which are in the core of politically , can keep on further .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse is repeated often :
you are free , and anyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which you can get in his words , &quot; that you can get &quot; - be faith or not believe , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that someone who speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay , les@@ bian , and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals still have been strongly ised in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online programme RO@@ Y@@ A , to remember that his comments were torn out of the context , ver@@ ted and his opinion had been destroyed .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , stretched , but was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is open to the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that Int@@ oler@@ ance should not be aware of homosexu@@ als in Islam .
he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still stayed with his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what would work once on the order of cali@@ ber , in the eighth @-@ century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can do Jordan did not work ?
the actual problem , such as H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled , too .
the kingdom of the Kingdom is nothing new , that the government attacks on the free use of Outlook and that progressive votes will be brought to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service , several former government officials ordered and members of the apprenti@@ ces@@ hip , with the accus@@ ation , they would have related to problems in social media , who depend on corruption with the deep roots in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b concert is said , only the top of the Eis@@ berg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him , however , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a is now a stand for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks like h@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , covered and inner changes . he is confident that these changes are going to be held in the heart of the Jord@@ anian company .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs were also , of a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he did not appear only to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem , and Damascus , but also of them , &quot; they too . &quot;
perhaps the region is using music , art and literature of a real and basic water @-@ se@@ wn - and not by bombs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and artificial art @-@ guided democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to pass and thus also make resistance to the resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ eness are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
we suspected that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which came in usually in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . some more than a thousand years ago , the army inv@@ aded from West Japan into the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region that Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to add a couple of great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only be hard to imagine how large parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ t@@ l ) .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time , but I have just recently seen the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival takes the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre high tower was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare were external appearance and body Care as important as in this history , because they help to promote the Peru@@ vian Youth of Crime , and a legitimate profession like the hairdresser &apos;s home .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important harbour , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trade are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 , that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region was not safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and the unusual hair@@ dress@@ ers of famous sports singers such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , has led to that there is more normal people to the experienced hands of hair@@ y , which can make this complex hair@@ style .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ s , which will go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has an annual event inspired by the hairdresser &apos;s &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there will come to compete against each other , who can make the most ec@@ centric l@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who took place in El Call@@ ao , can give their weapons against hair@@ dressing , rather than that of bad rat@@ chet to get training in the hairdresser &apos;s shop , which allows them to find out work .
motivated by this activity and the ways have dozens of young people seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered a special training workshops in front of the beginning of the school year and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which is very proud of which we have been very proud , for love with the children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love brief@@ e to guer@@ rilla power

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the next version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Liebes@@ message to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ters , &quot; which has published international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only a love brief@@ e to people who we know ?
is it not even much more important , people who feel the aff@@ ection , aff@@ ection ?
this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters for reconciliation ) to write the young people to write the letter .
recently , their land was the scene of a historic event , and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( german : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signature of the peace agreement was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his peace services .
however , before the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ l@@ umen , who lived for many years , have lived in illegal camps , have been exposed to an war@@ fare and around the clock , have to integrate their weapons in life than civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company , in turn again , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in their lives and in some cases when compared to guer@@ ri@@ vals , it must begin in their rows and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young colum@@ nist and the integration process would have to help .
and exactly what they did not know : until now , thousands of young people are written - Liebes@@ message to former guer@@ ri@@ cot , to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ cot , which should be personally handed to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day than inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation we took place at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had given the chance to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explains that we love the people who love you , on the Valentine &apos;s Day , they don &apos;t forget , but those who need it much .
he plan , he told , in this year , he continued to share his love with people who needed for the urgent support .
in this case , the plan , letters with hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC must show their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&quot; I never thought that someone would be awarded to me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 , in one of the United Nations in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ iana &apos;s University of Cal@@ i , two members of Cal@@ i &apos;s municipal government and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC proposed as they had done earlier in order to take part in the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ mer@@ ing from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness , and everything that is in between , &quot; said the political knowledge student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience .
after we passed the letters , me had a former fighters to the camp of guer@@ rilla fighters .
when I was in one of the &quot; Cam@@ i &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the Guer@@ ill@@ ot@@ ters live ) saw , I saw a guer@@ rilla struggle , who wrote a little bit .
I &apos;m afraid to go out , because besides him on bed , there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ egran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the Dorn@@ ar sleep .
I still said him , saying , &quot; hello , what do they just ? &quot; He answered : &quot; I answer to a letter I wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hoped full letter .
never in my life , someone else has written a little so beautiful , that &apos;s my response to me . &quot; I suddenly get the tears about the che@@ eks suddenly .
I converted him , and sat on me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , it was sorry for the years of faithful companions , this fighters , and he wanted to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never claimed to join the war . the F@@ ARC was the only opportunity to keep him and his six brothers before the famine . &quot; I never thought that someone would be given me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society that is open to us with open arms .
until now I learned , how I need to avoid weap@@ onry with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things to learn and work in D@@ ign@@ ity . &quot;
new votes
at the opening date , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came to a panel discussion .
the students were all raised as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in ob@@ sc@@ urity .
therefore , the F@@ ARC leader of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot; for many years now we had the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to a political party to make the society in this country .
for a target of this size , it &apos;s worth to overcome all obstacles . &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people who had never had never found them , and to recognize that people who have seen often as monsters , and even h@@ unts , even people with beautiful feelings , which were turned through their habitat and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , in which the country is living , does wo@@ unds me .
but it dis@@ solve me that all men - even those who are killed , and so much damage may have brought us a little smile , and a smile , and a re@@ arm@@ ing can give us .
many former fighters have been responsible for the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was made , that after the de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of peace would be made .
but that &apos;s not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there are always people who are ready to attack arms , to raise up and for their rights . and that &apos;s also a perfectly righteous ( ... ) .
we now set the F@@ ARC on the peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace upon - regardless of the race , religion , or ideology , they will be among all those who dreams of a country in the war .
we give you our word , our post and bring victims , as we know from their own experience , because we know that nothing is easy . den@@ oun@@ ces among us who defend life as the basis of the existence , many problems are coming .
on our way we will give many obstacles , but we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people , living in Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a large variety of dangers exposed - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and compress@@ ors .
with Schre@@ cken activists the reporting of the last months over the persecution of pregnant women in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , not only about night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny which has dealt with us in us and has spoken to us , what happened in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal action in Ch@@ echn@@ ya had conquered the international head@@ lines in several months after reports that the dis@@ closure of torture and killing que@@ erer in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gas@@ eta , a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , suspected the suspected que@@ er men and they put into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
you have brought a monster to the world . &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a cross @-@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman .
when she was growing , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya had no saf@@ er place for it , which was why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had experienced by sexual inter@@ religious woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
in fear of her life , she moved to the US .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per for a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone had my help .
it was an acquain@@ t@@ ances from Da@@ gest@@ an , a cross @-@ woman to trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without to wa@@ ver .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that could eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos made by my documents through quite W@@ hat@@ s@@ App into the round .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing , a few shopping bags from the back of my cars , I heard a lack of one thing : &quot; here is a gift for you by your uncle . &quot;
when I turned to me , I feel something in my body but I did nothing else .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you don &apos;t want to reach the family , you guys ? &quot;
I knew the person .
I know only that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and a last En@@ des in the hospital again .
it seems to be some women with everything and started out .
the man had fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two key@@ word in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nurse have been laid down - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , since there is my male name about it ; but the doctor stood up and laid me in the women .
I am grat@@ eful to him .
when I got his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , an Cau@@ cas@@ an name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he has gone up with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February , I got threats .
she said to me , wrote me - relatives , foreign journalists , some completely un@@ familiar .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and several distant relatives .
to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove to prove that everything was a lie .
they announced today , saying , I have to prove it , by doing it above the streets of the streets ; others wanted to make my family on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny , I say that my sex was not changed , and in Photos@@ hop .
I have ski@@ p @-@ size C - what should I have to say in the television ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to turn with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family but the entire republic .
we can not stir up , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and laid it a rope around the neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours , and ret@@ ing them came .
at the time I had to change it several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with dark@@ ened window discs and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 on top .
after it had happened for the third time , I was clear that there was something f@@ ain@@ ly .
my human rights friends ex@@ poses the number@@ ing friends - it turned out that I was followed .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
out of security reasons , I don &apos;t want to pay its name , but I will say that I am all remember ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then there happened something un@@ believ@@ able .
I still cannot realize how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SI@@ M card to call my mother , as soon as I arrived .
I bought them , without reference to register , without reference , without all .
I broke my old SI@@ M card and loos@@ ened it in the Mü@@ ll .
came to and check into the hotel .
the number was registered in a stran@@ ger .
I put the SI@@ M card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I asked my mother to W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you have been in safety , just because you have left the land ?
our people already know , in which hotel du plug . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : stand with your family still in contact ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , through the sexual inter@@ course , we don &apos;t speak , this is a tobacco topic .
some traditionally cas@@ ca@@ sian elements I still have still in me .
so much I wish to wish to do this past@@ oral barrier I can &apos;t be overcome .
I say , I say that , as long as my m@@ om am life , I will do my best to do it .
when we ch@@ ord with camera , I give I really trouble about how the person would like to remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that &apos;s very hard .
OC Media : know a little about the present location in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who remained the d@@ ort@@ i ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for this , I needed to see current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with somebody , the one and a half month in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan were hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he completed a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
so my I invite you to see the relatives , that they take care of the problem with the affected person , and the end of demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; by blood gen@@ ug@@ z@@ ung .
OC Media : will also be detained for men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there was not very many .
if , above all such that have no sufficient relatives or have been left out of their relatives , to be Kad@@ y@@ &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that you can present them as terrorists .
that means : should they be converted into television , they will show their body in television and claim that they would have been attacked in your village or a military base .
understand ?
these people would not have gone all , but specifically ge@@ aring up to radi@@ ate radi@@ cally .
OC Media : is now only a ver@@ ge or have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just returned to someone who was imprisoned in the one and a half month .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison , after her husband had grown .
there were nothing new of them from them .
they simply have taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken .
however , until now , they were not presented as a band , so far there were no reports . we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why did you have not allowed these people to shave themselves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; know whether these verses and demonstrations of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; which took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I made my hair for getting long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think in 2003 I was already familiar with I , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was never engaged , I never had trouble .
on the contrary , it was much more saf@@ er than now .
Russia wanted to go to the &quot; Civil War , &quot; but ultimately came back to the stone &apos;s stone .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were cl@@ oned ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore red@@ dish je@@ ans and a short T@@ ops .
the Security Department of Sh@@ aria never gave me a hair by just a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , a whole group of people met for me .
it was a little place where several banks stood there , and all the city knew of it ; they knew about men , young people , there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a expression : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ otte not over the evil one another . &quot;
it often says it often with children , if you have fun with the crane .
OC Media : so they simply have closed their eyes before you , because they believed to be sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never been offen@@ ded , never beaten and never beaten .
OC Media : how long kept these Gn@@ ad@@ ence time ?
Sab@@ rina : for long , until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in TV via Mor@@ al .
he did not talk about us , but priority about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could see how people in the city began to change .
who had before gel@@ elt and had eight , looked at once with Ar@@ g@@ w@@ ohn .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could see how the situation in the Republic steadily lost steadily .
OC Media : what can you go right now ?
Sab@@ rina : I am working as a cell@@ ars .
I did not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month , not far too much .
apart from this , I &apos;m still active as an activist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ated with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ tions , tourist information , I beg@@ ining them to the hospital and hel@@ fe them to get out in our cards .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny of this .
I have discovered these people even when I am the sanctuary .
I am Muslims and want to help the help you need .
OC Media : carry a Hi@@ j@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is al@@ bs .
so the nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there are no oscill@@ ating with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ers have whom the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have also whom the Russians have also what they are ; in all the planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that is why it is un@@ pleasant , easy to hear .
I met here as many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan , live with men .
know , many of thinking about Tran@@ si@@ dential . to men , men love , and they believe that one of sex changes to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a chest .
these are two different things - two different species of emotion to be exact , different habitats .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin , and not for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad - I don &apos;t know that I am myself myself .
local groups war@@ ts before an increase in self @-@ mor@@ des within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffer from an un@@ usually high labour force and poverty rate in the native Arab population .
for the last few months , there is a strong ascent of self @-@ mor@@ nings .
the picture of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is min@@ ted by poverty and unemployment , to the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under Ang@@ li@@ as , depression , and he ch@@ anted for his own aid , the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi rights groups , who would work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and to remain anonymous .
a video on YouTube actually shared the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it fast to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to the local sources , the burns were so strongly that the doctors could not do anything more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that has been in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists before the place that even more men could take the life anymore .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights noted that some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Say@@ yed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ es and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tami@@ m - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have a thing in common : there were everything family fathers , who prepar@@ es because of the persecution of the Iranian government , hil@@ ly and in@@ able to feed their families and a secure work .
Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based in the majority of Iran living in Iran , is surrounded by a profound economic crisis , sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to get to the native Arab population .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was one of the most autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and took up 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran , with oil and gas fields as well as some of the most important and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to only slowly slowly , and the native population receives only little from this riches .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and discharge .
the Iranian regime refused to be systematically being systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ ms , the water of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation region through dry matter , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate below the Arab se@@ w@@ zi @-@ adolescents increased to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Mohammed P@@ ur , an Iranian @-@ General Director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , mel@@ ted that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who has completed a work of primary school , 55 % a further school , and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... the aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rass@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; to a &quot; high rise &quot; of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that in particular the unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z to become new ethnic and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since Fabri@@ cs and institutions preferred not to adjust the Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to working opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of the systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs to destroy their lifetime outside of their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to hide their ancest@@ or name , to hide their affili@@ ation on the Ah@@ w@@ azi , as they are not called Arabic names at the workplace , because the speaking of the Arab language or the Tra@@ gen Arab clothes are .
given the given circumstances which must bear the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ azi , the human rights activists , before the situation is explo@@ sively .
it remains to be waiting if the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge of the world .
the main reason for suicide is unknown depression .
depression is difficult and suicide is avoided .

when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , react to many women - especially the white women who describe themselves as an interactive fem@@ ini@@ sts - with Fr@@ ust .

they even lay well @-@ thought @-@ thought scientific and social arguments that I should be femin@@ ist , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally do all femin@@ ist * .
for example , women still reaches less money in spite of the same formation still less money than men .
that women still suffer from str@@ close observation , if it &apos;s why they are going to make it with their body .
violence against women had a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards are still able to ensure women , or later in various fields of life on a smooth ceiling , and that discrimination due to the gender is still moving across the many different countries and faith .
all this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman . I am a black woman .
and yet : if I say to skin colour , on Rac@@ ism , black female women , and black female women , who had already been fighting against r@@ ust and verb@@ al women , as well as outside of femin@@ ist movement , many of the fem@@ ini@@ sts of femin@@ ist movement left many white fem@@ ini@@ sts and white inter@@ s@@ ect@@ oral fem@@ ini@@ sts .
however , however , all the agreed that women - all women - join forces to lift &quot; their voices look and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to achieve the Gender equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , a institutional form , led violence , that we have exposed black women on two times .
or , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ sts and country of origin are less deser@@ ve for the white men and women .
that black girl and girls with a migration background the school is more than white girls due to apparent integration problems .
or that women in black split and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer , as well as the white women .
on the one hand , I will consider that all men , all men and all men have not been connected to the same rights . on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect me as a black woman , in their center the white woman who ref@@ uses to take non@@ sense in their thinking , which include both the sex and the skin of a person .
I &apos;m afraid , and I will not be able to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented , who always wanted to fight me and countless others .
so@@ jour@@ ner did in 1851 in her speech : &quot; I don &apos;t have any woman ? &quot; and I have made me to get a ideology , in which the black woman in historical regard is a human beings , and mar@@ gin@@ alization .
I want to join me of group@@ ings which also absorb through cultural monuments of our seat and customs , to promote their eg@@ o@@ centric program .
I don &apos;t try to increase the importance of skin cancer of skin and sex . because some of them will continue the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement dead , no matter how many black women will try to honour her better .
although the inter@@ s@@ ect@@ arian femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different religious life and to mark the white femin@@ ism , still is the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I am going to join me , and conf@@ essed it of femin@@ ism to join me and my status as woman in life , instead of me to a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , that is so tough , that interest is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and let us go into the Sp@@ h@@ ort , which will be created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the Book of Afri@@ c@@ ana , said : &quot; we can do us in this way that they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be given , which make up the black woman .
although some white and interactive fem@@ ini@@ sts immediately call separ@@ ati@@ m and exclusion , after they have read about the hypo@@ cris@@ y , and the contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in an older environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m there .
I am grat@@ eful due to my dark skin and due to my life as a part of this para@@ mas .
I , a black woman , can blos@@ som in a environment in which my life nor do not ignored , nor are ignored .

Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled to Iraq over the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or can@@ oe . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Emi@@ ly Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who declared to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution in his commune .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we lost , had lost a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country , that the decades of the war , the construction of dust , contamination , and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ bottom Alliance - that works to protect &quot; the rivers , bakery and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened version of the article &quot; The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # 6 ) that reported the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected people .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ its partner who had become violent in violent business .
since the end of its relationship , a little time passed and the police said that his testimony would not be laid out of the acts , but they could not do it .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena was shown for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , even the acute code display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing .
a few days later , the second wife moved their ad .
the Devil &apos;s prize of violence against women is difficult .
if women were given at all at all , they will not receive any support by the Sta@@ ats .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that they are mis@@ sive . this explains why only 20 % of women who admit the victims of violence against violence , at all at all at all .
in@@ s@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system which is nothing inferior to the 3 @-@ ays laws : good approach , lack of stro@@ kes and statistics
it is difficult to see how many women really will be har@@ assed , he says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , research scientist at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ ur , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that but not even ans@@ at@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 , the District state At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office 9@@ 600 displays due to domestic violence . at 70 % of it went to violence against women .
86 % of the ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace . here , 86 % of the displays here came .
in advertisements , 40 % of women , that they were physically ill , 55 % of women spoke from psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
however , this statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to data from the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women Ana Bai@@ ardi are actually shown only a few of these quotes . &quot; on any woman who ref@@ und@@ able in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who ref@@ unded by physical missions , two women who do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
because women &apos;s murder in Paraguay had no own stra@@ igh@@ tening , the law en@@ forcement agencies cannot be appropriate , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists participated in at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay are documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates dies in Paraguay all ten days a woman due to violence against men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing .
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was a hard friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the name of all of their former friends .
at the beginning they did not know what they did not , but then . this should be always ready for ever .
today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and not more with Carlos together . however , two years the psychological violence on the one - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time :
I never thought that I would never be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I have been read earlier , I thought that only women happened to sub@@ stit@@ uting it because they are forci@@ bly by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used to report social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook , in which they described its interests and different attacks , during their two @-@ year relationship , and told them , as he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked about it , whether he lifted up the hand against her , and refused to be le@@ vi@@ ed that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users surve@@ yed Mari@@ ana , why they had made the so long time of Carlos , and not previously left him .
it seemed almost as so when they wanted to say that victims of missions have had at least some fellow officers .
Victoria Santos , which dates back to Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove it their former partner for them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way of missions .
in the group you can talk with other over their experiences , listen to each other , listen to each other .
do you do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her prosper@@ ous partners decided to convince them to convince them that they had been valuable .
he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ &apos;s displays with the authorities remained without the result and even from their relatives , they did not support support .
they led a trial against her former partner who developed an un@@ break@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former Partners .
universal laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very well but not applied .
the ad of Mis@@ sions is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the Justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also looks great problems near the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed under the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ llas ( # Für@@ y ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ inser@@ ts ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Amnesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain Fe@@ mi@@ cide on a free @-@ standing Stra@@ ft@@ at@@ orial to explain and harder to terms of criminal cases , and in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legis@@ lature was changed in some points to prevent the members of the law that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which currently banned in Paraguay up to five years and was pun@@ ished by up to five years .
the original bill had provided that the majority of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process costs that have to carry out the victims of violence itself , if they simply have to use only indication , and make a safe accommodation to lay the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lature has no enough financial means to be provided for :
abuse was seen as part of human relations as part of human relations .
here , a re@@ think is thought that violence does not exceed anything more than anything else .
who , in view of these facts , he ple@@ aded not guilty , and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators .
we have to out@@ fit for long indication , until missions is no longer regarded as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law were adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law was changed . among other things , a passage in cases where the partners had called for domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section concerning the reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the Ag@@ gress@@ or to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual desire &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great feedback .
this article is the short@@ ened version of the article &quot; The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ j@@ er ( # 6 ) that reported the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continues to attacks .
&quot; this site was closed due to a resolution of the Information Minister . &quot; this website has been closed on the website of the Az@@ am@@ n website .
more than one year ago the om@@ anian authorities have closed the independent arab@@ ic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was arrested , and was arrested and returned to court in later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had de@@ posed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , who de@@ posed by one state .
since then , next to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Defense , Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme National Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ ans of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the inv@@ alu@@ able efforts of security services , especially in public civil service , including press freedom , associations and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , to freeze and incar@@ cer@@ ated .

the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the incidence of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the Press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties of Justice &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . in this way , he went to Cor@@ ruption in the Jus@@ tin and the composition of high @-@ level officials in the judicial decisions .

the paper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the statement had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissem@@ ination of the newspaper on any other way , including online , starting August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
the first trial before the court in Mask@@ at took place on 26 September 2016 in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both committed to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; Miss@@ ing of the Internet &quot; and &quot; the sub@@ marine of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a audience and s@@ lander of s@@ lander .

the App@@ eal chamber also took the decision of the information Ministry to join the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees the paper as before attacks by the Iranian government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Health issued a statement that was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Foreign Minister , signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the Minister for the decision of the App@@ eals Chamber rejected the publication of the newspaper again .
the constant cl@@ ash of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press was hurt in Oman in the youngest time .
to further injuries , for example , closing the site of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture with his stories
medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rarely , or not mentioned . this is a growing area that addressed one of the urgent needs of the continent .
two reasons for the need for local medical research , there are two reasons : for example , a number of medical health , many medications , and vacc@@ ines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culo@@ sis and malaria have in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa a widespread effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the Pharm@@ af@@ ir@@ men are a great problem .
second , research , which is being carried out by African scientists themselves , with its own research capacity in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Research of Inf@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ology in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s at Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic , showed the first gravity effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a degree in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself participated in the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the most effective health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on the mis@@ understanding of media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
Global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in addition , I have the sam@@ pled national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ed a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are of your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there are no basic research here . we are only solutions that have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver rather than to be m@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where comes the financing and support .
is it sufficient ?
how easy or hard is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are different well supported .
it &apos;s hard to find people that come back , or come back here , for the financing and the development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are in your routine research work , which you didn &apos;t had before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure corresponds to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , continuous supply with electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public on science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be trained in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , which should focus on , and how can we support the development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting in every age .
social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and increasing diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this very benefit .
g@@ v : you can describe the pre@@ - and cons of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often they are the limited speed , things , and sc@@ ents access to scientific expertise which represent the challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible to the payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also of available information and the speed of research .
from the US to India : as &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers make the world &apos;s global food production .
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a@@ .com website , a magazine which reports about solutions to environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bred back in the USA in the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ sh@@ red@@ ders , the first plant , which has been carried out by NASA astron@@ au@@ ts in space and consumed .
for almost 20 years , mortality became work only by its own imagin@@ ative and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ titudes can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2004 , he observed that more Sal@@ ate were patented and that it could not be used for bre@@ eder .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ ational or green leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant breeding , environmental protective and expertise for food security to the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of thousands of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on still does not use salad , he needs longer , since its work is still longer enough , since its work is still further .
it is , when I would lie in a river a rocky bro@@ oks which I have been ump@@ tions .
so we must make this , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he says . &quot; I think this patents will go to Sal@@ ate .
and when they reach the court , no one can stick to a new sal@@ es@@ ky , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it good as well as possible , tried to kill those characteristics .
however , it is very careful and to use no material to use , that is protected as a intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that will always be used in the US and everywhere in the world will always be bigger : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ edings ) .
astron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman sal@@ ine of a variety of sh@@ red@@ ders in the greenhouse station and eaten it . there will be tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space space .

it is not a coincidence that this name is rather as sound than would be the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ seed &quot; ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to a protected software .
it was set up in order to ensure that some species of plant species , and could not be protected as a intellectual property , and thus can be used for plant breeding .
as part of the initiative , shortly O@@ ssi , U.S. bre@@ eder can &apos;t commit that others can use them @-@ free seeds .
this does not mean that they do not continue to grow and sell it with their seed . &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eder allow only others to express their seed , and it is not immediately abol@@ ish - two aspects which is forbidden by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
view : view of the dunes
the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ssi @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the ability to increase new plants in both food security and environmental protection .
seed is to give him a role in larger connections such as Bio@@ diversity , rights of peasants , control and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would try to try , latter is not or little to use with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasized that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement is not working with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , gene@@ tically modified , or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability in August and September 2016 , we would like to know how it is offered for farm@@ stead , it should also know that the type and way should be cultivated as this vegetables is bred .
the nutritional value without seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the open source Se@@ ed Initiative uses to commit their seed to others . in contrast , its procedure is in contrast to the seed , seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ssi @-@ Support to argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the traditional con@@ vey@@ ance due to the increasingly important spiritual property rights on plant @-@ material , which is always available , is essential , is essential .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , Managing Director of O@@ ssi , engaged in her thesis with gen@@ eti@@ scher &apos;s variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all the boxes are protected as ge@@ ared property , so it is not easy to use for plant breeding .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or car@@ rots .
one question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through their taste or their color improved up to such , due to those of them live in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents on crop protection properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is due to more patents . genetic diversity is currently less than ever before , because the changes in terms of climate change is much worse .
in an e @-@ mail address , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity in general and also important for Mon@@ san@@ tos . with a total of four major banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the United States , the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , however , the view is that the ownership of other bre@@ eder systems , as &quot; patents and the protection of crop protection products . &quot; a patent is basically a plan where everyone can follow , as soon as the patent pending .
often help this instructions to come with another method of the same result .
there is such a protection to inhi@@ bit innovations , but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent board , con@@ vey@@ ance certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait for a long time , the plants can be adjusted to the modified environmental conditions , you should have lost the battle .
the main relief for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources always have been a general public and even should remain in general : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ eti@@ ere are not attractive for us .
we want to support farmers in their work .
that &apos;s it , that is , and it will be impossible to us that if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
overall , in total , Mort@@ on refers to the concept to patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not create the features .
the plants they constitute itself from and as bre@@ eder , we needed no idea how the plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ssi @-@ member , there is still another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who knows a variety of species , bred his own values into them .
those who believes to the industrial agriculture with large numbers and mon@@ ocular cultures , to be needed for cultivation in her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bred into the agriculture of agriculture .
my concept is exactly ge@@ ared . &quot;
while a few medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have the most smaller seed companies - but without patents , they reject them , or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ worth@@ while or both is the case .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder is due to the avoi@@ dance of plant patented innovative , &quot; It looks like that I think to produce new efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that argue .
I need to sell new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are going to sell me into a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years ago , it is very nice to make my mind about very nice . &quot; global reson@@ ance
in fact , the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; concept to be the concept spread so quickly to all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed , works with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports it to sell at &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organisation has been working on an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; license that ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ssi @-@ commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ edings differ from land to country , present because the O@@ ssi @-@ commitment is not easy to be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission explains that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented , so she says the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows the patents to conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , a statement is still no law ; now it is on the governments of Member States , to provide patent amt to implement this new line .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source , &quot; seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ance of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &apos; open @-@ source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems building , for which the scheduled next year is to drop .
a merger of environmental protection and development aid ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the International Non@@ non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and bio@@ biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed map Project to publish a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of Ess@@ ens - a consortium of aid organisations have to come to seed , and improve the seed policy , making a stable supply with food and food .
the importance will also be the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ssi hopes to be able to recognize him more people .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly be played , and some seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we try to try out the people that even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
the Egyptian government released the new website for Human Rights Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which reported human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and said to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the so @-@ called Network for Human Rights Information on the bt@@ ful and the Constitution . even though it was difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are still exhau@@ sted out to overcome the sper@@ m and don &apos;t forget to be able to meet our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first to implement a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities more than two months of 21 websites , such as b@@ anning , the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking issue of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era , due to alleged support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the shaft of web@@ page approaches for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
alongside AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the Kolum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles , which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he taught in order to avoid the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ination of the Egyptian government , even goal of an attack .
B@@ logger , which is home to Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces when he took over the students of student and a video , as the police force physical violence against two students .
his article turn mainly by politics and the human rights issues in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary there were Zi@@ ada to the Sper@@ ing through the government and reflecting the government , which means that this means :
the blo@@ gs to sper@@ mat@@ h is very old , but has not been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the sper@@ m is not meaning@@ ful for the world , it is not yet meaning@@ ful for me :
1 ) It &apos;s succeeded to communicate with me the feeling of a siege of siege ; an arrest , dec@@ eived was in murder , pre@@ sum@@ mons at the National Security Council , the Sper@@ ing blo@@ gs , and any other web page for whom I worked .
2 ) you have proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have the influence when I only have a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to b@@ ypass the item of articles to avoid the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , however , after they were locked by him , and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g go down the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and expression ( AF@@ TE ) the Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06 . August 133 pages . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different internet service providers ( ISP ) , Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one , and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the Sper@@ ing providers that was possible by creating Internet c@@ ens@@ orship , and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we realized how the Sper@@ ing of Web sites , the V@@ PN@@ s began .
such practice indicates that the government &apos;s intention to continue to block content and filters , to which the Egyptian users could have access .
the situation , in addition , the situation is reduced behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction before the court can proceed against this actions .
now the question : how far , the Egyptian government is ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship , and if you &apos;re going to attack it as the next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?

one day reports from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil , the second largest city of the country and home to numerous posters show .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school was shot , &quot; and &quot; each second day a police officer was murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rau@@ ben , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air conditioning , to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a portrait of financial situation the violence between 2017 has been the highest level in Rio de Janeiro for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ government organisation Global Justice called for the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are every day and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
so , for detailed information on violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16th , the editorial article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; where they arrived , a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the idea for their decision declared the newspaper :
extra will continue to pass over crimes reports that happen in every big city on the world like murder , Rau@@ b , sex , etc . everything happens in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our kind to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to conclude that we do not close our eyes before the Gr@@ aus@@ ure .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , chief editor of the journal that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure was :
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ru@@ k in a country that is not recogn@@ ises the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the Zeitung describes that there are according to the information of the Institute for Internal Security , Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 regions , which will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial article , the newspaper continues :
in fact , it is aware that a military discre@@ t@@ ance when he shall be confused , even if he can &apos;t be confused , the sc@@ am@@ ites of the police , which only rule out , and then put questions to gr@@ asp .
but we defend the war on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partner is .
sch@@ a@@ det the name &quot; War &quot; more than they are useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued that violence as &quot; War . &quot; this is due to their opinion , by the medi@@ ated security policy , it might be able to withdraw from the police to calcul@@ ating the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra charge in the analysis of military exchange rates in Rio itself - in combination with un@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ f@@ ake closure of public service .
reminder : Rio de Janeiro &apos;s state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

among these safety policy measures , the Foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of the Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela to conquer and a unity to be station@@ ed there .
at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP took place in several reports about schi@@ sts and re@@ pres@@ sions of the poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made out of one of his article in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio was not determined by the Geneva Convention for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio considered a serious consequences for people after men .
for this , the state must use , funds and ways to use the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; which is a civil point in the countryside and is an un@@ sharp spot in the landscape and for the object for &quot; coll@@ age damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ oned balls . &quot;

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the country , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
especially strongly affected the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack against chemical weapons had called the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian Opposition are coming out , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that have been committed massacres of Assad regime in the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels in the areas of Damascus , by the siege of Damascus , which led to that inhabitants are produced by tunnels and control points by tunnels and control points .
thanks to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ act of Syrian humanitarian aid , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ mics from East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can use their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ food source . &quot;
they call himself G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near and perform the project with the NGO al Ad@@ ala by the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not too common in the traditional way , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their foods makes it out of an attractive nutritional source for many people of besi@@ eged by the east G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tor@@ ate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AFP
&quot; we decided to have a high nutritional value of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can see them in houses and cellar plants . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been strug@@ gled for three years now , this project is well @-@ known and expressed his relief , that it is now more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , nut@@ ze in order with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ near , the humanitarian crowd control platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to communicate 125 families of fung@@ i to communicate with fung@@ i , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € , but until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is aimed at generators to keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the greenhouse gases are used locally , produced in plastic , to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that she began to handle the fung@@ al &quot; production from the regions of this region , before they are transmitted at their quality , if they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project , and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to bring people out the fung@@ al breeding of various reasons &quot; : split of siege .
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self @-@ catering ( such as paper , tea , coffee table , cart@@ on , etc ) are used for the thread of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea to spread all over the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege .

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so in Afghanistan , Afghanistan became a country of the terr@@ ors and desp@@ air .
it was exactly at this time A@@ lu@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan Canada for the last time with his family together .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that they didn &apos;t see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his uncle would bring him out and bring him to the tu@@ p@@ res .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the haz@@ ard dom@@ ed party of Hez@@ ron @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara had suddenly prot@@ ested against the Taliban .
the Taliban were always closer to their hatred on Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his flight , A@@ lu@@ af found themselves in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ leg@@ ru@@ be . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then , he took the what was left out of his low salary and went into Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar which he@@ avier than he himself in order to earn his life .
back then , as today , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran is characterised by El@@ end and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; rec@@ alled A@@ rec@@ af , in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site at which we also worked .
there was no services and no heating . we saw nylon in front of the open windows , that we don &apos;t have been fr@@ ying at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ burned has left his life without papers in Iran , and made it ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous drive on the sea , it suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities denied his asylum application , A@@ lu@@ af joined Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ lu@@ af homeless , was ran through the streets of Rome , sle@@ pt in parks and went to a church who shared twice on day food twice on day food .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high definition quot@@ as quot@@ as is a kind of good chance for over asylum asylum . however , it is true that the conditions , asylum seek@@ ers in the country will be cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
the Human Rights organisation of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the System &quot; suff@@ ers from an overall lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special acceptance centers . &quot; this is about un@@ matched facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be shared only then , if they have officially registered an application for asylum - which can be prevented from the registration of asylum on asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the road .
so , A@@ bo@@ af also went .
but his un@@ il@@ ach@@ able life @-@ wil@@ le helped A@@ meth@@ af to liber@@ ate soon out of these conditions .
after several years he made various works in the construction industry , A@@ lu@@ af made his entire life account in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ el@@ li@@ mb@@ iss .
A@@ lu@@ af Bar@@ atis successful story is now the topic of the &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy ) of the director Amin Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , and the 2017 was awarded for the 24th time .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucra@@ tic , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
over the last few years , some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen personnel are mostly in the different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan women , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes from their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ u@@ lo@@ gna river in Bologna , and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are far beyond the Italian Gastron@@ omi@@ e@@ Industry and Retail to the country and aim to aim to leave the country that he had to leave his te@@ amm@@ ing as teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , even ways , &quot; says A@@ lu@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my land never forget , and I can &apos;t live , if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers in the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of the company and have to get the same opportunities as all other . &quot;
A@@ rec@@ af schmi@@ e@@ det also plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can sell their appoint@@ ments on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; says he says .
the development of successful business was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end stability and prosperity are stability and prosperity .
A@@ lu@@ af has made this trip itself . now he wants to help others to help other Afgh@@ ans on this way .

the Act , which was formed by sixty Parliament members of members of the Parliament , is currently under the Legis@@ lative Committee of Parliament and the constitu@@ tions there .
in May , another member of the Executive Board filed a complaint in which harder for the position of President or the high officials would be introduced .

if the law was adopted , this may mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the trial .

a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Zi@@ d ( known as Sha@@ v@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took violence against protest@@ ers that showed violence against military coup , who led to the office of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for such as more than 700 people , who had been arrested by the same incident in prison for four years in prison on a trial date .
recently , his trial was postp@@ oned for the 20th May , because the prison line of human rights groups had failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison in the Court .
Sha@@ v@@ kan is threatened with the death penalty , because many human rights groups agree , so@@ lic@@ ences of ar@@ rests , illegal assembly , murder and inc@@ ur murder .

the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were arrested in the previously mentioned incident , 25 years on 5 years .

the document on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , gives a light to look like the pre@@ dic@@ tive plans to support the bill .
