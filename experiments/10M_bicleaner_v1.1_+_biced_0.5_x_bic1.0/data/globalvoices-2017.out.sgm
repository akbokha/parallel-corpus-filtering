<seg id="1">Although I visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year I would live now for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my-generation I grew up with American films, I read American music, American authors read and its sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a derberry effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14 years I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a terrible reporter through the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stud. the Supreme Court ruled that the Supreme Court decided to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was" s, when the absolute truth is, glove everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And this year, which I lived in Arizona, had only been reinforced for the USA only.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country where I have lived in which I have lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very simple love document about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of its entry is for me, as he continues with its bottlenness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He thinks with his mind, never behind the mountain, as it says so nice.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he feels like a former colleague, and declared publicly discipated for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his testimonies, and voting for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, who won in the republican elections, was the highest number that had ever reached by the Party nominations ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was in german only.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biguous person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not be Trump, and his voters did not bring people with the people who I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalant program, took the people from all over the world, with whom I was able to keep up about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even the trumps of the Weltanschauung, not provided by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer" in the present edition of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us at our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours to play the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the major damage which I fights with Sandy Bahr, who fights for their lives in her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if it fits in the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me patience and rogance to me and my colleagues helped us to impact the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors that helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people, and those who are embodied by them, have found my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trunk his way to the nominal republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was however, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or maybe because of his dipped against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The dispute with the idea that people have been approved for trump, because they shared either racism and Fanatismus, or because they were ready to see these things, I broke almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is even the trump-voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people in order, said one of my friends, is exactly what is led to us of this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different kind and way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears of the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that this voters could, out of which most know are, for prostaggering, because they want to win over a country, that she has disappointed it?</seg>
<seg id="38">With other words, they wanted to say that they are still particularly important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who made the cruel decision to raise a man, who looks forward to those who look forward to those who look differently than he would look like.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (ed.): as much as "To all other Ethics"; word in white play on white and whiplash, as much as the great Van Jones called, has exactly what was so great so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world will appreciate the American Ideal-anyway, whether myth and reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background are still so welcome to America.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he says itself, anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: to hell with multiple strength, religious freedom and the whole term of Pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruins.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all of whom I have to remember Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a client for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with human rights.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn would have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a strong "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"were Muslims in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" for the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "Latinos is a place in your America?" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called her and their votes were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">As you would have someone, who is not as you, a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and quiet "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan decided with the words: "God be thanks to Mr. Trump, is not the United States." 36 hours later he was correct.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for his son, was sent to him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer be found in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">That the music that is played on both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with the...</seg>
<seg id="71">Living music, who lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large waste landfill, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists, but are popular from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (music bande) now plays in the church: one of children and adults's existing symphony orchestra that has found a possibility to overtaking them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students, has become the central interest of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The commune, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs-abuse and the Bages-violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and the youth so a rare hopes.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after the lunch at the lunch at the night in order to follow their big passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always lachable and play with shiny eyes and playing in the Trubel you can learn the day for trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Garnered music of trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village which is practically in the top of the largest waste landfill in the capital of AsunciÃ³n in the capital of instruments, which are made of reprinted waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments, made up of local fixed waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the departure in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments were imized Geigen, violas, Celli, contrabasses, guitars, fles, saxophone, trumpet, trombones and percussion, which were produced from the waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by Beatles music, Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local Ãkologist and Musicians of the children of Cateura, participated in the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no place for the samples and we had to teach at the same place, to the parents worked in the trash, and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something, which he had never seen previously: a piece of waste is produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from reprinted material and that's called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill HARMONIC" (Harmonic landfill) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of trash in each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here turn it into something beauty.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill HARMONIC follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has played his music even before Pope Francis.</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight the illegal fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing was fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry was written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine which focuses on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">It was known that West Africa was known that this ship had already operated in liberilian waters of illegal fish, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were brought up in these years and slightly inclined, a bill of this kind to be welcome to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique, and Seychelles mobilised mobilised on the ship. she refused to give him an harbours of the harbours of the harbours of their harbours.</seg>
<seg id="103">In suddenly, the Prime Minister Kiilu was a prime minister who just got anything of all things "" "," Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was sold in the waters of the region, it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Eventually, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia for plundering of fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of these initiative, the criminal practices which protects criminal law and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Centre (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are next to Somalia and Madagascar as the six countries, who had fled to their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">We have eight countries that are like to work together, and they are coming together, where it is illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal project. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, it is hidden, and due to it extremely difficult. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of the regions of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the visible abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types must be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem damage which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during actions against illegal fishing began to resolve due to bureaucratic chicks and by the snapshot-emptied the information between individual countries, so the actions now carried out in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There are these individual countries, for example, please consult the existing licenses to existing licenses, news to suspected activities or details which had noticed, or experienced during a harbour.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursued the activities of ships even very attentive, when they move on the open sea, via satellite drives.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows you to meet the authorities to meet ships that can be found in verbotted areas. even so, the suspected route will be able to discover, such that a ship surgrief from fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the case of ideas, such studies can show whether the ships have a fish license, where they were on the way, and possibly whether they have a strafregister.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fish, can be found on the basis of these ships in their harbours, meaning that the ships may not sell their cargo ships. and that they can even be forced to be forced to be forced, as in the case of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "then there's significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fish are not worth more worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to reach "" "," says Per Erik Bergh, Head of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beraterman based on illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">Closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already-called platform has been created, around 20 million US dollars to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrating in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish species, present because of the region of commercial fishing in the world. among these things, those of illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among others, actions include the sailing under false flag, fake licensing papers, indication of Phantasienames, fishing protected types and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "you want to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non lenshrined control system" "" "says Long." "" "earlier it was illegal to fish and a country could not go to my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">However, another country could say "Komm to me '." and exactly this legale gorges are trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">Date closed the closed front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH was involved more than 30 investigations of more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">There was criminal networks, uncovered, the fake licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that used a number of fraudulent identification and it has been tracked-off ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our studies carry us quite far into the networks organized crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He is building a system, the FISH-i is to help to carry out more precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, helps to raise the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with a fishing data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example, using their automatic identification systems, which they cannot be purchased by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information panels. FISH-i is also helping to find a criminal company with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">Model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's Team African nations actually do influence on what is undoubtedly the global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth, together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oceana opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, is a platform that can be displayed in the world each of each individual traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of it, who is what makes sense" "" "says," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to combine to unite and their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project, in which a global system allowed the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not just criminals, but also shopper.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships, which formerly known without a license, and hardly with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of those participating in FISH - i participating countries with a 33% increase in fisheries, since fisheries have been selling more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko 1 gave up the inspectors to the inspectors where the Inspectors were banned under board on board.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries notice this successes. "the effect is strongly that we are well known that other countries are" "" "Kiilu." "" "we have become an academic objective." "" "in West Africa disappear a year of several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are six countries assembled in the so-called West Africa Task Force. the aim of illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH. "with security is the aim of becoming more such initiatives and structures, even in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recently invested in Somalia with his first big triumph: in October, Greko 1 introduced a ship to drive under false flag. and not only the vessel was without a license, which now have been banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also reserved in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" "" the sign of the rules against Greko 1 put a strong character that they go against illegal fishing, "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a particular, collaborative work in the oceans is actually working in the entire world.

<seg id="234">He gave me a small dish in a ceiling, and commanded me to bear the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clumps of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day, I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen objects were absent and underlined me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly, he said to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the detainees are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I jumped and saw a song that were tortured by humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">They looked like a field of bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it possible that a man can do any other so much.</seg>
<seg id="248">"" "I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father worked me for the third time to work, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the detainees were frozen, and validated and eyebrows.</seg>
<seg id="250">He talked with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a series of mattresses, on which wet people with the face to below, all were at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance there is silent on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="254">I opposing the opposing "Why do you have to me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were killed in a pit, and was buried in a pit.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know because my father told me.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms which were known as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero became a man together and killed there.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here they changed its name and they were to be assigned as part of the process of human beings.</seg>
<seg id="265">When she survived the Torture, the detainees were thrown into the cuadra, until the arrangement of above came to be relocated.</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked me how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I understand it just.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer in the gendarmerie and I was never before, into a house to penetrating it into a house.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father was doing.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I answered: and you, the du cars on the road again?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded to Wut, struck me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go forth, then I will find you, and bring you stand down.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one another!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father.</seg>

<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then I was a jacket and a roller sweaters in wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, he accusing the defence, a co-literacy in this crime. I used to resist, no problem, they may wanted to put me to the load, what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there to try out there.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abomite act'</seg>

<seg id="295">Well, you've done during the dictatorship of men. but to do the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children carry out?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl with home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this a little girl was.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always gave me the question: they were tortured, but why were them killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have just been in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people to kill these people?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not even had families, of which one could have passed away from the remains of the remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abomite act, which can do one person.</seg>

<seg id="309">I even was even with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just have just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought about my father, arose during a talk when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made his allegations because of all of the greetings that I had to experience it.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said, "I don't know anybody else."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt indiscontinued and asked me to what the whole range of Patriotic atism and the "Western and Christian feelings," which she was allegedly defended.</seg>

<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, which has been repeatedly divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator of Julian Holmes, a inhabitants of Kyotos, who had fallen down to the local time. he was also aware of the local time.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Protocol, Khimbun, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to so English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This shows that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is a reward of elderly people, and in an international city such as the Kyoto, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was removed. the name "" "" (German: "terrible drive") was later replaced by the appropriate "fields" (german: "older drivers") later. "" "</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Protocol has been added to the translation errors. furthermore they declared that the mistakes had already been included in the text that they had been tested by the translator and that the translation wasn't checked in her judgment before she was released.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"it was sorry that elderly people caused by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was somewhat detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers "in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" has been proved as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older moter, are involved in accidents, but quite a way to Sorge.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Protocol, for example, 1.941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by the seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, the age of 1.803 caused a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide frequency of portable scanning are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important abilities: passive skills in order to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter also requires the active problems of the target language, which is in the case of breast cancer in general, the belief that translator in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So it should be a French speaking in French speaking, for example from the English language French - not by French.</seg>

<seg id="381">Many Japanese company employ no staff with English as a mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for the overset, Kostengo or the relatively small number of English text in Japanese, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have not have any foreign worker, translations are still able to manufacture translations. then the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is made as the best one, for translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The simplified and mysterious sentences, which arise by machine translation, show that this technology can do not replace human translators. this applies to some languages for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the inseling prints, which often used T-shirts or bags, are used only from stylish grounds - not to be read or even understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewellery are acceptable, or at least harmless. however, by large enterprises or from the government which have funds, higher standards can expect higher standards, you can expect a careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary report recently ordered a bill to "the regulatory submission regarding the use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">When he was accepted by the parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authorities to register social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a place was set up, which was assigned to use an permission to use social media, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users would have to register and users in the site with their real name and personnel numbers, to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">There is no longer to do this, so the sentence of up to six months in jail, or a money buckle.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragrams and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application which runs on the Internet and uses to communicate with other by voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is rejected, as the scheme is rejected, as they account for the benefit of their registration, which is not to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government currently does not plan to guarantee the regulation on stage of the social media company.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary and conveying of the bill, told the magazine Al Monitor, registered users and users received a password and a password "to come through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">It could mean that Egypt is planning to maintain a firewall on the national level around Facebook. due to those who would be able to address the Egyptians, and the Egyptians would be able to submit information about their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known that such plans have not exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts are very skeptical regarding the technical feasibility of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (on German "chief researcher") of the Egyptian Initiative for personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal Rights"), writes Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I have been strong to do with the technical capacities and understanding, neither authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they are so that as they seem to control a physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take it seriously, then it means that they are a strong monitoring system to apply to citizens who apply for a permit or not. so, this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings, and to carry them a trial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically unrealistic - but in Egypt, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be passed as a law, the draft must be discussed at the European Parliament legislative elections and the constitutional Complaints, before it returns to the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control will be used, and be sure that no deviating Narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, Tamer El-Shahawy filed an amendment to Cyber crime, who was not guilty to a life-sentence for those who was found guilty of "public order" and "to protest action."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo decided to rebuild the life of those who were affected by the "Thirty catastrophe" from March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an Atom accident in Fukushima had the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">In Miyagi, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has its headquarters in Sendai in the Prefecture of Miyagi, in the Northeast of Japan, Miyagi Prefecture had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had disappear throughout the coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even the Prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a atomar accident that alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows that from local point which have been reached after six years later to rebuild the live-based resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of the person.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts are in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi achieved the greatest achievement among the three prefectures of Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, while Fukushima reaches 70 percent of the final.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe that evacuated from Behelks were evacuated in the final spare parts for six years.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in Behelbows.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 per cent of the evacuation in 2011 were evacuated out of Fukusagi. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were evacuated according to the disaster were used in final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The work of the work and everyday life in the three affected Prefets.</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools were affected by the evil, its gates are open until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult to be more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing villages in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, Fukushima only accounted for 30 percent of the fishing industry.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomare accident, have moved into the three prefectures of the agricultural land large-area.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of its arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic bomb, as well as 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed farmland in Fukushima, there is a nuclear power zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered in recovering, but also at Fukushima still remains true.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist elections in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same stand, as before the bad. Fukushima, however, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was harder to earn their habitats.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population to the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture of the native population, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and under the evacuation. she asked her about the status of rebuilding and, as well as you can find themselves on the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung declared:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey by more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of the main-resident inhabitants are coming to be prepared for future earthquakes and Tsunamis to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents said that there was still not enough for catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands to those who were evacuated out of the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has strengthened its attention to the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, catastrophibit Unif, who had to experience Japan each.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people evacuated from Fukushima were moved to nearly 63 000 people in areas outside the Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little over 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, have been resettled back to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside of its home Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In catastrophides regions, most of the evacuation, still known as 50 years old. you can compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Forgotten Forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of Ãlvaro Reynoso closed nearly hundreds of sugar-tubes factories in all Cuba (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±ali Palace, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as Central - to Spanish sugar mill, unexplained that there is no nennilable sugar content on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago, when the activities were placed in the sugar-tubes factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">According to the explanation, the sugarcane industry in the region is silent, and the factory lost and after its plants, until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained left.</seg>
<seg id="630">For about 272 workers had to find themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and pensions daily to the factories that are still intact.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldata veteran, who stands out every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not have its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it has been in the east of the sugar betube factories that have been reactive after a long period of time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">This was something that he was not unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is remember exactly that in MaÃ±ali get the sugar tubes factory, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarcane industry is already the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prizes, the low market prices, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motif for some decades a motif for the country, but the bad inthia have already been no novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why, the Cuban sugar-tube industry was eliminated?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the municipality saw already better time.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar-tubes factories was technically outdated, and hardly more competitive they were unusable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to concentrate to concentrate on the efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories to produce the sugar for the most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">Is the solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs, which led to such measures, were the small productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the random crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, will be issued by the 2016 report, "Landwirtschaftskammer" from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">When the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar would cost about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">No everything ran good.</seg>
<seg id="652">"the present day is going to be with safety in history," that were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro, during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From this process began the process of restructured in the sugars industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years, a total of 98 sugar-tube factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for continuing education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar tube factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±ali on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known, about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those surveyed: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus, they will receive a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first half year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially dedicated to documents that would be removed only by the parts that are removed, the address and the date was distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulum Rosales del Toro, only the minister could be approved every resolution.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there, the responsibility was over and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the stillted factory and he was one who received the letters. "the land had no money," assures any money in operation. "</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for the pension in one another system, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will in the disclosure of the factory, which he helped, helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part, which he remote, dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and major jobs was removed.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for employment and services have been generated in the communities which were generated in the communities were generated.</seg>
<seg id="670">We never know whether during the Mammut speech given from 21st October 2002, when the President had seen in the eyes of the present people, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories would not have been in operation for five years, everything would be well-run.</seg>

<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted high by Melections.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±ali learned that many things are changing, but not always to recovery when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory lock, or better said, when she began to take away, they heard them on the road to asphalted all the road, and also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without working in the region, and with the age of advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations communities in all Canada are engaged in the topics that are important for them. do they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of wandering workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan Tour has been in charge of mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to create youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by a teacher of David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree hip-hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases to ensure that the young subtraps in discussions topics such as "cultural identity, language, dispute, love, self-acceptable, or whatever them is in the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, in which the young people are the chief.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo is named First Nation in British Columbia, for example, a road section in western Canada, on which nearly two dozen were mostly indigenous and young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we have to have the international community the conflict, the cerebral and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readings and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a student of Animal PolÃ­tico wrote this contribution from taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Her contribution reminds us that violence should never be seen as a normal, no matter what makes it appearance:</seg>
<seg id="779">Many years now, I know that I've been doing for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I will pass every day to newspaper kiosken and see the title pages with pictures, that's actually only from a textbook for crime or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the only one, the angeerous or sad, it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can not be valid and consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin consider that he is great. and it is not normal that people can hear more about the "Heldentations" of the road, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, the when they would have to hear those who have lost someone who have lost and those who fear them so something happened.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories to blogs are in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The Tatennia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students can be justified in a neighboring village so that they were eliminated. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk about these lifting of lifting, if they are not stir and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "four months of pressing in the main city district:" it describes how armed criminal month for month money was not only destroyed by the business until they were destroyed only the business but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="797">We want to be arrested that others will be arrested, because you don't know when they lead you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I asked if wine could solve my deep root feelings, but the reply is no, because I don't forget how to get wet. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence."</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the endangered city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of the age, whose parents are care of care.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had made a egg, potatoes, potatoes and warm, and "Chichi" for the baby does that dwell in him. this is his name for the preparation of small bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left hand - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">However, they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unleased for boys for the whole life of violence and had to learn to life.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he said that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day to ended his childhood.</seg>

<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of people according to the civil Security Council and the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the country in the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of the headlines in view of the headlines. this project reminds us, but those who don't forget to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco," the Data journalism project has set up the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trade, who in the country in the last four decades, in practice, natural manner.</seg>

<seg id="909">The news of these news, the president of Myanmar, decided that the president of Myanmar, and politicians have been involved in the killing of Rohingya in 2012, and brought the story with the picture of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release, the image is still included in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 on students who were arrested by the Boko Haram, published by the Boko Haram, it expressly stated that the image was not from the killing, but it claims that it was a "similar-jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the image later was in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram in circulation in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to resist that it would give connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanÄ±yoryayuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world).</seg>
<seg id="915">The DR Congo appeared, with this Twitterhashtag, and disbate a discussion among Muslims after the Boko Haram's massacre on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took place in the name of the Islamist, a larger interest in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was split as a reward for the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retweetet), but the messages that were linked to no religious context were taken out in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to set attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison by Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (ese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that allegedly was allegedly written by one "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre was killed in circulation, put on discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared the Falschmessage.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretine missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of a faulty usage of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">In other countries in the following countries (at the portfolio in Grau), TinEye also has a completely rety: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, The Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original crash of 2010, the picture may ultimately become a correct description but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (inserting) that make these Posts through. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Muslims, or Muslims in defence of Muslim - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddha.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is rated by a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion that want to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it's worth to investigate how images can be used in connection with this efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a lower question is however, what happens when Lesern can not give these images for no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are about people who have unintentionally unintentionally, to practice the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested this mood in the error and falcons that actual atrocities are untrue, and it is the actual gray of what is actually in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has been updated already in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">A argument is that the back of pictures of a pasture that comes to recognize the tragedy. to time, these images even demands this pictures even by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent pictures reader and spectators should be able to emptied to empathy (for example, this study, examined as violent media, to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some violent representations of the news system, the fact that they are indispensable to be indispensable for today's news effects.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologic experimented because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they are thoroughly aware of the situation in which a picture is something that actually will be replaced by the context or in completely missive species can be used.</seg>
<seg id="940">A any inquiry into fallowerage should also be taken into consideration as international they can be taken into consideration as international.</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists were in Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - EnÃ¼h you for your parents in recognition, how to have worked in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "kwadi" - The ease of ease or fiess, who is to feel, after you walked to cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They practicing other cultures, revealed other kind of thought and check our new shalling yards.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence the world by us, and classified the linguist on this page would like to release more of these "unbeatable" words, and there are different, valuable and impressive in these small languages.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already led this entertainment already.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have been working for many years, separate me - the Sahar who they know it - from the widely used concept of "Muslims," which has built itself in its presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1004">You won against me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We cannot show all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practicing our religion.</seg>
<seg id="1008">In order to be able to be Muslim at different art. but somehow we will be placed all of the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">These drawers are so well constructed in our collective presentation such as Muslims who like Muslims who are not fit there.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Dictions will be Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1011">I have not been doing it alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poets, whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">As Jalaluddin Rumi as old, as I am now, he was an orthodox Muslim preacher and scholars.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day, where he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western presentation, religion Rumis deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This solete makes a big part of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another of other exists in the reactionist images of Muslims, Western books have been colonial since centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This veritable image language is determined by the dark man, the one should be afraid, and the exotic woman who should save.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="1025">For three years, I worked for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful, faulty Narrative has dominated our Newsflash.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrativ, the reality, which have led to nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the US was not able to elect her first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narractive failed to recognize that if French, Muslim women are involved in public buildings and sudi Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, which are both by two of the same Medal.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group committed to his "Control" on the other. "</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narraping down Muslim women who lead the movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also looks like that the first Muslim Brotherhood were spoken on American soil, which were hiked to slavery.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It turns the existence of Queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrativ has become so deep and faults so that often Sikh-Men and the children of antimulus attacks and schizophrenia are occupied.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories that we tell and because of the way, in which we tell it, Islamophobia are not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Part of the 1.7 billion</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just stories about stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narrative, who help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry is saggy to capture the narrativ of 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1053">Because of the stories that we tell and because of the species, in which we tell it, is Islamophobia in more than just a stranger, who preached the head.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why can I see here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, who has shown to us how war has led and people through the work of the "other" in the public presentation, four decades in the scientist of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to present themselves unquent issues according to the role of the Women's March, because the employment that we have a new future - which we have no President, the chocolate of the chocolate, while it was broken down, while he was broken down to other "people, and goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can it be possible to give it possible, here and now, despite a language barrier with somebody?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in its original language, is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently over a other initiative of Steven Bird, the Unenable Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, the focus of TLS is not written on the written, but on the spoken word. it is a try to get the language selection of great cities and to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the newborn children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">To this project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we create cities, diversity, and safe rooms, in which inhabitants are not forgotten, who are in order to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "for" "" "we hear often associated to understand" "" "to understand these events instead," the confidence to estimate "" "" to the "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, orchestra will present their history in their own language, and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants have no professional skill counter, their devotion and their account, the audience will be able to draw the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Simply call laughter and emotions, when the language does not show a barrier in longer than a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows such a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which will be told in the language of Dafing. during this lap, the story of Rassidatou Konate was also the opportunity to explain its country typical customs of stories.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamuara tells the fork out of the Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona, Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he asked the importance of His flightness, John Nyamara is asked: "how to speak to a audience, that your language does not understand?" with a widths, he shares his feeling of the incubation:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were plenty of attention...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were quite near me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project, can organize with TLS in contact with TLS in order to organize their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico, calls for the state school of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1155">On April 3, 2017, several religious and bourgeois organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started in the puertorific Capitol, the government buildings of the capital city, and from the city, to the Plaza de ColÃ³n, in the town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was called "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the neural meeting of debt) and the German Assembly of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">In addition, the care of the new translation of the United States have also submitted an Petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos calls that politicians, volumes and government agencies, which are responsible for the debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We request a financial assessment and an assessment committee without personal interests to the public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions, which is active in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are prestige and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a guilt which is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be found in dropping pensioners.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the state-owned territory of the United States - was suffering from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organisation without party leaders, a law on the socio-economic development, a law to state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos require a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">From the exterior, measures will be imposed without the Participation and the conviction for the citizens of the people who can be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1183">It is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, he set up his support and members of the campaign for his freedom, and recall the contributions which he took place for an open grid.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©hie Dulong de Rossini, scientist at Book Sprints, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the Book of Freedom of Freedom: A Collective Inquiry (The cost of Freedom: a collective replica) from three to five days.</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and is freely available, and contains a number of inserts, dealing with free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to read how movements for free knowledge and what the true cost will be connected to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designer, developers, researcher and authors, who have been involved in the movements for freedom knowledge, have left side to see about the nebula, which gives our newsfeeds and create a bit sense of our experience.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers since March 15, 2012 in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was released from the Adra-prison camp, in which he was sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since made no information about its current state or position.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title of collective memory is his friends and his family a voice which, to his release, and who want him to know him in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has paid a high price for its participation in a free culture, has many of us begin to rethink about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What do we decided to do?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we leave in this process of time extreme overarching?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012 the Webdeveloper for Open Source and Digital activist is a military government since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was born from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and attorney Noura Ghazi reported that the military police Bassel reported on basis of one of "strictly appointed" by the military court of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that, on November 12, 2015, Ghazi reported people who had been contacted by people himself as Insider of the Assad government and they were aware of an alleged death penalty against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his residence and condition remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in order to extend the access to the Internet and understanding for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, designer, Technologe and currently overclocked the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded in Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of the bass prototypes were prehensive as the factory that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the way of how many civilizations and the Greek-Roman architectural types with hiescore traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">In the time, Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would all set up this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of sysrians but the world embodied.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This slipping into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capacitive, which will be the public for the public, as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In fact, Bassel could not close this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life in order to dream of liberty and bassel taught me to poor poor.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I have been overwhelmed when I left his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English when he had already been in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, to read and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always dealt with any knowledge, which has asked if he has taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me, both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought the other defendants, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without theory that actually stopped one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a prosabbath, which she wrote in detention in 2012 to 2015, when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She made her text to him, when they visited him, and he put it from the Arab to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is free-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Envelope from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens."</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">In the world of your charming eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I left the occupying in the moment, in which we moved to us.</seg>
<seg id="1231">That me, any of the risks does not matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the tooth, armchairs and watchman</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forgotten the memory of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter into every detail of your voice, and I have a words of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I find with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes don't say?</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I got another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I return quickly to my loneliness.</seg>
<seg id="1239">To travel all the moments.</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to smile on your absence, and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I surprised myself myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">This year, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">During this period</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage I am,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cheese of the monster</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels History is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of protests against the regime Bashar al-Assads, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (syrisches Network for Human Rights) have gone more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed by the regime disappeared, were tortured or executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many more people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices-Community calls for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique k: because of Corruption, condemn the director of a warrant for arrest warrants back.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique's reacted to wrath on a corruption, in which a government member after half of his sentence was returned to work in the State apparatus, to which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This was arrested by Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other defendants in 2010 (about 800 000 euros) for 22 years.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza was appointed between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to a good guided tour and demanded his resetting to the company, what happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney's Office, which allow the application to refer the application, there was no obstacles to refer to Cambaza, back to his old post as the company was not represented after his prison.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The center for public integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution, uses for public transparency, sentenced to an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision to set up the company again in an interview:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a return in the fight against corruption and clear, the lack of transparency and is even a step in view to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we assume, that the company should have agreed to enter a disciplinary committee in the case of a disciplinary trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, it seems to be true, however, does not seem to appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding features.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, an important voice in the moset of social media, reiterate this behaviour and considered the case as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to prison in prison and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could play lectures and motivating words, he could advise and his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But when he was incompetent, he has made it to be integrated into the company which he helped damage to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Hence it is obvious: Cambaza will be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistance!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique's and student of Political Science in Brazil, says the director of no Moral, said:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he didn't let him think I cannot be rewarded to such a way, who has already insulting the state already so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the State, but instead only served on the state only.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a handy source of money, and the state itself had become tired of this man who finally charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, remember that a Dieb belonged to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diebe belong to the prison Samora Machel, who will not only remain the first independent president in memory, but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - following - A Prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to be able to sell the patland for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so much. he changes the tactics, but he does not work from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is decriminals at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he was sentenced to 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it is the company at which he took advantage of money again, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Family Buildings (@ azo _ Rafik) will be held on 12 May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The burmese word "Kalar Pae" means Kicherse or spawse.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their podium out of the net because they had the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word will still be discussed, it is normally used to refer to humans East Indian origin, or general as Adjektiv "Indies."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "the word" "" "Kalar" or so "" "" (in burgers) as part of an initiative to tackle the far spread problem of Hassi in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In the last few years, the ascent of radial-nationalist movements has given an extremely abstain consistency.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as Hasselt, which is a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar'mag" "" "is usually brought together with racism in connection, but the word that is not automatically admits through Hassismus." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important and # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, or doubts have to be expressed in order in order to have the expression of his work.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmese words with basic different meanings, which are the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmesisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letter, as well as other words as' Kalar Pae '(Spage),' Kalar OAT '(Kamel) or' kaljaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocyte Aung Kaung Myat explained the various translations of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was done today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends to spiritual kind, whether they could wearer, as he could be his back pain, where he made a word game.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The set ku la - "cure" (ku) + the questioning (la) on Burmesisch - resembles a racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Various reactions were on the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hun is the opinion that they will reduce radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic must be certain, before it is to spread all Posts of solder to spread the suspicion of Racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "the word" Kalar "is not manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatic set is not understand what you do on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should make it instead, the post is carefully sent to analyse and check it to check the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae" (chair).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this three-legged nationalists who spread Hasselt, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to complain nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action will send a strong signal to all, the Hassase may spread the efficiency of this strategy.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven to begin to begin social networks, to create a new word, or an alternative writing of the zenge word, to get their views to their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his podium when he only wanted to announce his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends, that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironless my Post was removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the Post "Facebook community is not consistent."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from humans, which have no negative intentions or the just try to show their opinions against the Hasselt radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, nothing has to do with hassi related language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">To address the Facebook page without hostilities.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post office, the author presented his opinion about, why extreme nationalism and religious locality are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook will have to do more about the initiative of the initiative, for example the burmese Internet community around Rat:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a well-swollen intention to reduce racism in Burma in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words gets to play, only more hatred will bring in the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems to have started using this without local context or technical support, and as such as "chair" or "pesencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out that they did not have any mistakes, they did not appear to dissolete Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they could only have a little bit, respect for the 15 million benefit, which would give them a great turnover, the great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided by a lot of fun under the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Rather than to take it seriously, users have fun and write the word 'Kalar' not to see the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hassi to see if their podium will be taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts, which is not mistaken, but nevertheless not removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Permission was used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and a herbcurry eat and a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try out, if Facebook contains the mail, the word of Kalar contains. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post states "If you are a doctor, healing people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, with permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist Ideologies and religious funamentalism, social networks have used to expand their voices and its influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt, in social networks and violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area Rakhine where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was intended to say to his burmese sides, to his burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than just read the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to migrate than in the context of a code of concentrated initiatives and learned by them.</seg>

<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world nature heritage. what could give it better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested in the home of Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my Father that on the banks of the Rapti River would be a Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I finished with my camera and was in a handful of minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had seen him, and showed me the place on the other river, where the Leopard was found and I started immediately, pictures to tripsen!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to achieve a collaboration with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition for Nepals, and would like to make understanding the understanding that wild animals are not such as furry, as they look like they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he had already stood out from the face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be heard by the opinion of sheep not at sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late evening. the light is weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for" "(lit.: I click on environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Its passion for the promotion of Nepals nature and game is not always simple.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published here as part of a content sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts, women avoid women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a Pronomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to give women to computate her husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should obtain the norm of the age.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state of Odisha, convicted by their family and the village community, after she had married a secret relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition, wives will not call their wives, too, is also common in men. however, they have much less damage to fear if all that, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health spersonal and housewives, a unique club in and were quickly became the main subject of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss the enemies of the patriarchate's enemies and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs, which is available in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KHelicopal's campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and uses the degradation of the Patriarchers.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works with the help of her video amera for seven years, with the help of their video amera, including children's rights to the Association of HIV- and AIDS-Ininfected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for those women and have made it at the same time on bott inside of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, showed Rohini in their discussion round, was the name of women who did not call their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this topic for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can identify easily.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands didn't leave the name of their husbands, they have not guilty to all the demnity of their liability.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition has testified that a woman and her husband, and he wishes a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not appear, is regarded as a listig, as woman without Moral.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of Rohini, who had never called her husband until now, had never called her name, at home, how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My father-in-law and my husband had a long time after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Internash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I was to call him from his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first Discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed it had a good thing, as it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in course.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant in the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, refuses, sad, affectionately and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked them, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they call us how they want, means that they don't matter?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Shouldn't be the same? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">Some of these women have been married since 30 years and this was the first day to leave their husbands on her husband's name, "Rohini Pawas born out of the village Walhe in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition, who had never noticed the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that they had just escaped from the exercise, and another decided to leave the whole strike against him and his family to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the Adrenalinrush order, with an ancient Brasses, the women decided to try to try to name their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what they put the women into the head: his wife couldn't hear his name to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at the dinner time before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she did, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said, I would do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in this was less, delicate, and the situation of violence in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports that women have tried to stop other practices, such as the interest of the galnoberred point on the forehead, which shows the adulteratus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnoberred point when it would also be done.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only took the eighth and I heard it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion club is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we are a excursion to every Discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually, we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make sure that those who could hear what could hear" "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays in her life, with cakes; they danced and sangen over things that had never had never thought before they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini said:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I've been working for many years, and I have been working for many years for many years, for example as our Identities at our husbands are still not so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It does not feel great to say some things according to say, no matter how small they would like to have a occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion panel, we have informed about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been worn only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the okay, but some wanted to have a salu-Kurta, a vast shirt of a shorts, they don't have to be shared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion on the advantages of his own hangers, the Moral associated with the Saris and much more, muggled Rohini of their own pair of Kurdish (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear and Rohini can be sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since her first discussion board, Rohini confirmed that things come slowly to the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women have had a few times, but we heard again to say the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, don't make me, but only if they are alone and don't have any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say to the names of their husbands; only one or two women have now at any time Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in Discussion club know that the changes that they want to accomplish in their lives - like the fishers in order to get more motion or's own clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By adding each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini stated:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too. I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. it will give a chain reaction, if any woman goes back home and other people talk about what we talk, and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We sit on all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore is a city or a land?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might appear dumb, as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be considered city as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has been triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting in the international branch of the Association of New York, the Minister of New York noted that many people criticise the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It is supporting that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has put in question whether New York had a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, whereby most people go an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to declare that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a town.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accusing the Minister of Justice in order to defend "logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and resolutions, that valuable land to create that valuable land, let's say that we had to be any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It is so volcanic, it had the call of a flight before the responsibilities, a compulsory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, you eat land?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanmugam were not very novers: he defended an idea to measure the political system of Singapore, not with other 'normal countries', in view of which it seemed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore was compared to the cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities, which are permanent party of a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the river, the good old corer of the authoritative Machthabern, who prefers to give democrats, leave out logic as they fit better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, in the last week of Shanmugam, answers to its American guests in regard to our press, our Judicative, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions are clocked with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls to Shanmugam to his opinion, as they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to whom the country belongs to the city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Shortly, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would have been grateful when our beloved K Shanmugam would like to clarify this point where he was paid up to this point in order to be part of the city's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By writing on the blog, he has published his comment on the blog, in order to read that the full transcript of the conference will read better, in order to understand the context of statements by Shanmugam, to which Singapore will be a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">He said that Singapore is rather one "city" be regarded as a country, "said why the elections in Singapore was so low, even if we are still free and just another elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was able to win Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities were able to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore "was not a land, he did not turn it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan displays its disappointment over Shanmugam, which makes it as leader of a small-growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to spend...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least, I was with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which is expected me - I should agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not sure whether he believed that it is really associated, and it is aware of what he is defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review broken the vulnerability of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "has committed a mistake" or was there a joy of joy?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of Singapore city?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Because he plays an important role within the government's cable, the testimonies of Mr. Shanmugam of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why are the people of Singapur to their military service, they defend their city but not their land?</seg>
<seg id="1725">If you have to pay our Prime Minister accounts?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">That's the journal Journey of a Decade to Being, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "I did not told what I told" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have many people's more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a town.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / islet state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I understand that we often understand how" the defence of the country mainly "etc.", but that is not quite correct. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should say rather of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices, recently asked his editors: what is the most violated aspect of your home or home?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Its responses are published here as part of a ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world, and another Facette should be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that will be laid on most in Japan, is: "you are Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," response I then. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation, the conversation is taking place, it is considered to be a courteous to show interest in his speech by using personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clear address, the default response is usually: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, nature." many Canadian, perhaps inner to Wut, if they are kept for Americans, but don't leave me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little, that differs from the Americans of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians will bring an Canadian flag good to their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand, however,...</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already 20 years ago when I started to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before returning to Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadian have always been worn around small Ahornals on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Even since 2005, Canada has been legally required since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We say very often "excuse". "</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as such as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate it.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First of all, I have made a lot of American friends I'm very wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not be nothing, if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Together with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "kind."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of: as "kind" is called to be called for "a kind, gentle, but most important figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpson "(which has its own Canadian double management).</seg>
<seg id="1769">When Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would be a step towards the front. but the actual problem is that "kind" has no personality. "</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing, at which one can be done.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, that means inconspicuous and uninteresting, and not deserve attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good when you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remote view from the things that happen around a week.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far as far, say that the desire, free, and alone, is a major ship of the Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what an external" nice "" "" is perhaps just cool just cool. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadian talk not often about the fence of the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the hot, open kindness, which I now work with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau was the stage to show that Kanadians more than only "kind." our Prime Minister has experienced a sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our Partners PRI.org website and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, he is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is directed by a 59- year-old Mexican, a little woman with a corals of pink glasses and golden ear earrings in Teddybears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is the ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many among the name of Mama-Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a goal of Afrikaner and Haitian, who has become a destination on the journey.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no longer charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 per night, the guests can sleep in simple rooms, with sink, brittle walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signposts to the hotel, but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama-Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama-Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is more quiet, but in this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some of some have already slept outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They would like to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">They also helps them, and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they purchased them, they do not pay to pay them with a balm away from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him to see whether Mama were a reasonable name for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has one Joghurtard) of the ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, with the ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I feel that it fits to her, as African women are very nice.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1921">It has the heart of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We are very pleased here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston, to get there to her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Afrikaner churches which are on the way into the United States, to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other towns of Mama in Africa. "Mama-Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest made from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and Africans were traveling along the route and that the Africans speak to WhatsApp by Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his way he has lived Michelet previously in Brazil and has worked as a building workers for the Olympic Games and the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at mum Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I query him whether he will contact us in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez contact.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama-Africa is our mother and we let them go back," said he ridiculously. "we will always remain in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests will send their often text to send her, if they have gone to greek, or tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought their place, chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only radio of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valencia.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family took place in their little house in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Polizist and has found that the bus tickets can be sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them, a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 persons, mostly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings at the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenela explains that he knows what the guests can go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "I lived in the United States." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we had suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. this is the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was assassinated after a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova melÃ©ndez is told me that he had fled in Honduras with his wife and his three children of people, who wanted to kill him money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked after an accommodation and a well-known ones, an all-stone, has offered her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the hallways, the travellers need to consult your phones to travelers.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus is now arrived and has 20 new guests, a lot of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems to be happy that her house is full, but it is also the nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she shook it in their album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair fleeing which has made a client in some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed, while she pushed me shortly before.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats every time every time. "they are already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users have been tested by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a Spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone users in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi, to install a cell notification in which the district government has to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the report, the app is said to get access to terrorist information on terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, kÃ²ninthia the authorities also use the app for more than fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because she was installed shortly after they had replaced the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police the app provided the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists and track that together with "illegal religious activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockage web pages, of online fraud, punches and phased-pages to make users looking forward how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app is for minors for minors to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the remote control "state players or even hacker could be able to manipulate the home network of a person to manipulate or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">It is in line with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While melodic over digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the east and south, is the reality very often dunes for those who live in remote, urged ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit its unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict-areas, the authorities often require extreme zinc and surveillance measures, as well as routinely, internet off-off.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet "images from Mainland China" (so far), the zenith messages published in China, displayed photos of a checkpoint where the residents of the people's most unaudited to the policemen as they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian is sure that the people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you have discovered a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a return for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They are forced to use them, devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity to wattested by.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We returned back to Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">In addition, "images from Mainland China" (so far), in addition, a Jingwang product description, which means that the software should be able to lift the password for a Windows operating system, and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones into Xinjiang an electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city-party, the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government-two, authorities and the party with related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on operation of its computer and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="2065">His order is to rip me so much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube, which is probably from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker ergs.ed to your write.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you can not return your terror.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My Schreie fell not enough for him, and why they were able to exchange the tube by a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked me whether the investigators had been working as a waste collection, or whether it was one of the normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other, to present us, from their perspective, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them changed three of them, while I was still going to the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all my body in my body - and even my voice, which I heard up too.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling and found a skirmish at all, which is why he is as one of an electric loaded handle.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my entire body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My seminackers, the stretched on the ground was the perfect power manager.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The Tauern disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he met his sentence for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself back to sleep. let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours went to me, who came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the early light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I am answering with the voice of an exhaustive young people: "my lord, my father must make awake worried."</seg>
<seg id="2086">Be quiet and get away you, you'll need. "</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">They have always released me.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib spoke about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free opposing and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib raury a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib carries out the majority of his time inside; time he fired on his screen, time to his computer, and again at his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be left, you can discover a cigarette between his finger or his Nicotin lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which has been part of the West Bank since 1967; and Hdaibs had been forced to bear his family from her village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is an passionate activist, who is the conservative majority, and its ancient origins of gender mainstreaming, sexuality and free opposing through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often beating with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world. all these issues can not be found only in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities in Damascus, from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a someone who are not limited in his thinking, and it is according to their own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he is not open, he turns against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib viewed his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes that his compassion of those who try to survive in war-areas, anything with his identity than "Palestinian poultry," he was born, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own life circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think, because I am a man, while he soldered the nest-cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this period it is planned for Muslim, sunrise and sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also said that the public consumption of food was illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously hdaib has a certain weakness of how to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hand, a little bit with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the hose lugs of coffee and the Schwaden of Kent-cigette in the nose to the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison among free sky, especially when one takes a look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is simply to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to drink not in prison during the Ramadan water.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Jordan has had a performance at the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some Parliament ordered the Islamist branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexuals of Hamed Sinno, speaks of the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and is the principal reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press review of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was "straight" due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the band's engagement in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free opposites in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which represents the ancient proven legitimacy of authoritative regime in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement by Mashrou'Leila the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of Human Rights," which continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should be probably not easy-to-calibrated rhetoric, but in fact, a clear reality is clearly reflected in Jordan, which is clear in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib of traditional gender demen, by putting his vision from the fate of Arab women, the vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs were up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost her life through the hands of those who have lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years, the number of 'Honmorde' was taken up - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch said that the number of Honmorde in 2016 reached its climax. however, the number of honorary infrastructure is missing to support women who tried to have victims, murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for uninterruptions from the year 1954, women who have been arrested in prison for a certain period in prison, "and for their release, often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee of the family necessary that the woman will do nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs are delighted with great popularity and is well-known that, too, not before issues, who are in his country long as tableu gale.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib is alleged that his work was politically active, however, he has been one that he is his music, the full of explicit encourages on sexuality, freedom and opinion, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "he says," says "" "" he says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" is the focus again in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs which are in the core of politically, can keep on further.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">You are free, and anyone else is it. "</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which you can get in his words, "that you can get" - be faith or not believe, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that someone who speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay, lesbian, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals still have been strongly ised in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online programme ROYA, to remember that his comments were torn out of the context, verted and his opinion had been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, stretched, but was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that Intolerance should not be aware of homosexuals in Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still stayed with his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat would work once on the order of caliber, in the eighth-century openly about homosexuality, why can do Jordan did not work?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, such as Hdaib, have nothing with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled, too.</seg>
<seg id="2140">The kingdom of the Kingdom is nothing new, that the government attacks on the free use of Outlook and that progressive votes will be brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service, several former government officials ordered and members of the apprenticeship, with the accusation, they would have related to problems in social media, who depend on corruption with the deep roots in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib concert is said, only the top of the Eisberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, however, Mashrou'Leila is now a stand for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks like hdaib - consists of slow, covered and inner changes. he is confident that these changes are going to be held in the heart of the Jordanian company.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs were also, of a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He did not appear only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus, but also of them, "they too."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is using music, art and literature of a real and basic water-sewn - and not by bombs, Streumunitions and artificial art-guided democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until now, Hdaib will continue to pass and thus also make resistance to the resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant wareness are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which came in usually in August in many areas of Tohokus. some more than a thousand years ago, the army invaded from West Japan into the northeast of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region that Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to add a couple of great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only be hard to imagine how large parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (litertl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time, but I have just recently seen the Meguro Gajoen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival takes the only truth - and to spend a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre high tower was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare were external appearance and body Care as important as in this history, because they help to promote the Peruvian Youth of Crime, and a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's home.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important harbour, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug trade are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017, that 51.5 percent of the population of this region was not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and the unusual hairdressers of famous sports singers such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to that there is more normal people to the experienced hands of hairy, which can make this complex hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairs, which will go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has an annual event inspired by the hairdresser's "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There will come to compete against each other, who can make the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos to current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who took place in El Callao, can give their weapons against hairdressing, rather than that of bad ratchet to get training in the hairdresser's shop, which allows them to find out work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the ways have dozens of young people seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered a special training workshops in front of the beginning of the school year and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the next version of the Beitrags "Liebesmessage to Guerillakters," which has published international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only a love briefe to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even much more important, people who feel the affection, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was the two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign Carta por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Letters for reconciliation) to write the young people to write the letter.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their land was the scene of a historic event, and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (german: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signature of the peace agreement was so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his peace services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Kolumbianern, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilumen, who lived for many years, have lived in illegal camps, have been exposed to an warfare and around the clock, have to integrate their weapons in life than civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company, in turn again, who had accustomed to life in their lives and in some cases when compared to guerrivals, it must begin in their rows and support it in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnist and the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did not know: until now, thousands of young people are written - Liebesmessage to former guerricot, to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerricot, which should be personally handed to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day than inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation we took place at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize, which was held in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had given the chance to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explains that we love the people who love you, on the Valentine's Day, they don't forget, but those who need it much.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told, in this year, he continued to share his love with people who needed for the urgent support.</seg>
<seg id="2198">In this case, the plan, letters with hope and support for former fighters of the FARC must show their place in society and to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I never thought that someone would be awarded to me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19, in one of the United Nations in Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana's University of Cali, two members of Cali's municipal government and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC proposed as they had done earlier in order to take part in the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of submering from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness, and everything that is in between," said the political knowledge student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience.</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, me had a former fighters to the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I was in one of the "Cami" (a kind of cottage, in which the Guerillotters live) saw, I saw a guerrilla struggle, who wrote a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I'm afraid to go out, because besides him on bed, there was a MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the Dornar sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">I still said him, saying, "hello, what do they just?" He answered: "I answer to a letter I wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hoped full letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone else has written a little so beautiful, that's my response to me. "I suddenly get the tears about the cheeks suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I converted him, and sat on me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, it was sorry for the years of faithful companions, this fighters, and he wanted to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never claimed to join the war. the FARC was the only opportunity to keep him and his six brothers before the famine. "I never thought that someone would be given me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that is open to us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I learned, how I need to avoid weaponry with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things to learn and work in Dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the opening date, students and some leader of the FARC came to a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised as already war and the FARC were already in obscurity.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the FARC leader of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process. "for many years now we had the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to a political party to make the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this size, it's worth to overcome all obstacles. "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people who had never had never found them, and to recognize that people who have seen often as monsters, and even hunts, even people with beautiful feelings, which were turned through their habitat and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country is living, does wounds me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it dissolve me that all men - even those who are killed, and so much damage may have brought us a little smile, and a smile, and a rearming can give us.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have been responsible for the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Kolumbianern was made, that after the deforestation of peace would be made.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that's not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there are always people who are ready to attack arms, to raise up and for their rights. and that's also a perfectly righteous (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now set the FARC on the peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all defenders of peace upon - regardless of the race, religion, or ideology, they will be among all those who dreams of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, our post and bring victims, as we know from their own experience, because we know that nothing is easy. denounces among us who defend life as the basis of the existence, many problems are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way we will give many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has gone up with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">She said to me, wrote me - relatives, foreign journalists, some completely unfamiliar.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and several distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">To return to Chechnya to prove to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They announced today, saying, I have to prove it, by doing it above the streets of the streets; others wanted to make my family on the official television in Grozny, I say that my sex was not changed, and in Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have skip-size C - what should I have to say in the television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tried to turn with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir up, because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and laid it a rope around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours, and reting them came.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change it several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with darkened window discs and a numbering plate with a 95 on top.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, I was clear that there was something fainly.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends exposes the numbering friends - it turned out that I was followed.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Out of security reasons, I don't want to pay its name, but I will say that I am all remember; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then there happened something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot realize how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother, as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without reference to register, without reference, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and loosened it in the MÃ¼ll.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and check into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered in a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I asked my mother to WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you have been in safety, just because you have left the land?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know, in which hotel du plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: stand with your family still in contact?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, through the sexual intercourse, we don't speak, this is a tobacco topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally cascasian elements I still have still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to wish to do this pastoral barrier I can't be overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say, I say that, as long as my mom am life, I will do my best to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chord with camera, I give I really trouble about how the person would like to remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: know a little about the present location in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who remained the dorti?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this, I needed to see current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with somebody, the one and a half month in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan were hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he completed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So my I invite you to see the relatives, that they take care of the problem with the affected person, and the end of demand a proof that the so-called "honor" by blood genugzung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will also be detained for men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all such that have no sufficient relatives or have been left out of their relatives, to be Kady's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that you can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">That means: should they be converted into television, they will show their body in television and claim that they would have been attacked in your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">These people would not have gone all, but specifically gearing up to radiate radically.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is now only a verge or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just returned to someone who was imprisoned in the one and a half month.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison, after her husband had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There were nothing new of them from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, until now, they were not presented as a band, so far there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why did you have not allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "" "" "know whether these verses and demonstrations of people who belong to a so-called" nontraditional "orientation," which took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I made my hair for getting long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think in 2003 I was already familiar with I, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was never engaged, I never had trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia wanted to go to the "Civil War," but ultimately came back to the stone's stone.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were cloned; I had colored eyelashes, bore reddish jeans and a short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Department of Sharia never gave me a hair by just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, a whole group of people met for me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a little place where several banks stood there, and all the city knew of it; they knew about men, young people, there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a expression: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spotte not over the evil one another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says it often with children, if you have fun with the crane.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have closed their eyes before you, because they believed to be sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never been offended, never beaten and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept these Gnadence time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: for long, until Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in TV via Moral.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but priority about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could see how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had before gelelt and had eight, looked at once with Argwohn.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could see how the situation in the Republic steadily lost steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what can you go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I am working as a cellars.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not have much - 700 to 800 dollars per month, not far too much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from this, I'm still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicated with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize teettions, tourist information, I begining them to the hospital and helfe them to get out in our cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny of this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people even when I am the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help the help you need.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: carry a Hijab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is albs.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you with foam before the mouth that there are no oscillating with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagesters have whom the Kabardiner have also whom the Russians have also what they are; in all the planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that is why it is unpleasant, easy to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I met here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan, live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many of thinking about Transidential. to men, men love, and they believe that one of sex changes to make more intimate experiences. but that's a chest.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different species of emotion to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin, and not for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad - I don't know that I am myself myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warts before an increase in self-mordes within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffer from an unusually high labour force and poverty rate in the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under Anglias, depression, and he chanted for his own aid, the inability for his family, so Ahwazi rights groups, who would work in Ahwaz and to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video on YouTube actually shared the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to delete the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to the local sources, the burns were so strongly that the doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that has been in August within the Arabian Ahwazi minority, and activists before the place that even more men could take the life anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights noted that some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayyed Falah Mousses and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were everything family fathers, who prepares because of the persecution of the Iranian government, hilly and inable to feed their families and a secure work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arabic Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based in the majority of Iran living in Iran, is surrounded by a profound economic crisis, shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to get to the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was one of the most autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took up 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran, with oil and gas fields as well as some of the most important and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to only slowly slowly, and the native population receives only little from this riches.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and discharge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to be systematically being systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of damms, the water of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation region through dry matter, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate below the Arab sewzi-adolescents increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">NOUR Mohammed Pur, an Iranian-General Director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, melted that 5% of Ahwazis, who has completed a work of primary school, 55% a further school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... the aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that in particular the unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz to become new ethnic and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Fabrics and institutions preferred not to adjust the Arab labour force, the local Arab Ahwazi will have access to working opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of the systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs to destroy their lifetime outside of their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to hide their ancestor name, to hide their affiliation on the Ahwazi, as they are not called Arabic names at the workplace, because the speaking of the Arab language or the Tragen Arab clothes are.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which must bear the Arabian Ahwazi, the human rights activists, before the situation is explosively.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why do not seem to identifiable with the feminism, even with the intersectations."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is written by Ayomide, written by Ayomide, and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions came to the expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the commentary under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, react to many women - especially the white women who describe themselves as an interactive feminists - with Frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They are wondering why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well-thought-thought scientific and social arguments that I should be feminist, why I should be feminist and why we generally do all feminist *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still reaches less money in spite of the same formation still less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still suffer from strclose observation, if it's why they are going to make it with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women had a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still able to ensure women, or later in various fields of life on a smooth ceiling, and that discrimination due to the gender is still moving across the many different countries and faith.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman. I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I say to skin colour, on Racism, black female women, and black female women, who had already been fighting against rust and verbal women, as well as outside of feminist movement, many of the feminists of feminist movement left many white feminists and white intersectoral feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, all the agreed that women - all women - join forces to lift "their voices look and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing," to achieve the Gender equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence, a institutional form, led violence, that we have exposed black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or, that black women and women of other ethnists and country of origin are less deserve for the white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls with a migration background the school is more than white girls due to apparent integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black split and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership suffer, as well as the white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I will consider that all men, all men and all men have not been connected to the same rights. on the other hand, I can't connect me as a black woman, in their center the white woman who refuses to take nonsense in their thinking, which include both the sex and the skin of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm afraid, and I will not be able to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented, who always wanted to fight me and countless others.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner did in 1851 in her speech: "I don't have any woman?" and I have made me to get a ideology, in which the black woman in historical regard is a human beings, and marginalization.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I want to join me of groupings which also absorb through cultural monuments of our seat and customs, to promote their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I don't try to increase the importance of skin cancer of skin and sex. because some of them will continue the importance of black women for feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women will try to honour her better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectarian feminism was founded in order to give women from different religious life and to mark the white feminism, still is the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I am going to join me, and confessed it of feminism to join me and my status as woman in life, instead of me to a white feminist paradigm, that is so tough, that interest is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and let us go into the Sphort, which will be created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the Book of Africana, said: "we can do us in this way that they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be given, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and interactive feminists immediately call separatim and exclusion, after they have read about the hypocrisy, and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In an older environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm there.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am grateful due to my dark skin and due to my life as a part of this paramas.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in a environment in which my life nor do not ignored, nor are ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2467">The contribution of Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reported special about international efforts to solving environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">As part of a content-sharing agreement, this article is again published here.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa traveled to Iraq over the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or canoe. his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who declared to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution in his commune.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river, which we lost, had lost a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country, that the decades of the war, the construction of dust, contamination, and uncontrolled development, lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers - a subsidiary of Waterbottom Alliance - that works to protect "the rivers, bakery and water routes in Iraq, as well as the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa gives the liftness and importance of his work in a question: "if we have no water anymore, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video has been filmed for Ensia of Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and a multimedia journalist, filmed, filmed and edited.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of her work is followed, little noticed subcultures, and distinguishes itself through the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of congregated communities that can tell their stories on their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened version of the article "The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# 6) that reported the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed for the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their exits partner who had become violent in violent business.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship, a little time passed and the police said that his testimony would not be laid out of the acts, but they could not do it.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena was shown for mistreatment, even the acute code display of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Devil's prize of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women were given at all at all, they will not receive any support by the Staats.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men that they are missive. this explains why only 20% of women who admit the victims of violence against violence, at all at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Ins1 strokes and Statistics 2 Unvisible Missions and a legal system which is nothing inferior to the 3-ays laws: good approach, lack of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to see how many women really will be harassed, he says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, research scientist at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Eur, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that but not even ansatise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District state Attorney's Office 9600 displays due to domestic violence. at 70% of it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence in peace. here, 86% of the displays here came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In advertisements, 40% of women, that they were physically ill, 55% of women spoke from psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, this statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to data from the paraguayischen Women Ana Baiardi are actually shown only a few of these quotes. "on any woman who refundable in Paraguay because of psychic mistreatment, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who refunded by physical missions, two women who do not do this, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Because women's murder in Paraguay had no own straightening, the law enforcement agencies cannot be appropriate, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists participated in at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay are documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates dies in Paraguay all ten days a woman due to violence against men.</seg>

<seg id="2506">At the beginning they did not know what they did not, but then. this should be always ready for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 years old and not more with Carlos together. however, two years the psychological violence on the one - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time, the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would never be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I have been read earlier, I thought that only women happened to substituting it because they are forcibly by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used to report social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook, in which they described its interests and different attacks, during their two-year relationship, and told them, as he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked about it, whether he lifted up the hand against her, and refused to be levied that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users surveyed Mariana, why they had made the so long time of Carlos, and not previously left him.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as so when they wanted to say that victims of missions have had at least some fellow officers.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which dates back to Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove it their former partner for them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I think you"), which consists of women who are all in any way of missions.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group you can talk with other over their experiences, listen to each other, listen to each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Do you do what many others do not do: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partners decided to convince them to convince them that they had been valuable.</seg>
<seg id="2522">He started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victori's displays with the authorities remained without the result and even from their relatives, they did not support support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">They led a trial against her former partner who developed an unbreakable legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Universal laws: good approach, lack of implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws, which are very well but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of Missions is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the Justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also looks great problems near the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed under the paraguayischen Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# FÃ¼ry).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Noninserts) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law sees to explain Femicide on a free-standing Straftatorial to explain and harder to terms of criminal cases, and in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature was changed in some points to prevent the members of the law that the way for decriminalization of abortions, which currently banned in Paraguay up to five years and was punished by up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had provided that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs that have to carry out the victims of violence itself, if they simply have to use only indication, and make a safe accommodation to lay the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature has no enough financial means to be provided for:</seg>
<seg id="2535">Abuse was seen as part of human relations as part of human relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink is thought that violence does not exceed anything more than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who, in view of these facts, he pleaded not guilty, and contributes to that the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to outfit for long indication, until missions is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law were adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law was changed. among other things, a passage in cases where the partners had called for domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning the reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the Aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual desire" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great feedback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened version of the article "The shaft of violence against women in Paraguay" of course. the article belongs to the series # PorSerjer (# 6) that reported the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Most names were changed for the protection of the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continues to attacks.</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this site was closed due to a resolution of the Information Minister." this website has been closed on the website of the Azamn website.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago the omanian authorities have closed the independent arabic-speaking newspaper Azamn for its coverage of corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served a prison sentence of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zahal Al-Abri was arrested, and was arrested and returned to court in later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had deposed his father, Said ibn Taimur, who deposed by one state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, next to his role as the only Sultan, the most important branches in the country: Prime Minister, Defense, Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Supreme National Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans of the Sultans is characterized by the invaluable efforts of security services, especially in public civil service, including press freedom, associations and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger and other activists, to freeze and incarcerated.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities, peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically enforced and activists, activists, her views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, as well as offline-free as well as offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, their closure and the incidence of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for the Press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, was published an article entitled "High-ranking parties of Justice" on July 26, 2016. in this way, he went to Corruption in the Justin and the composition of high-level officials in the judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused, judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure, a judgment in a heredite will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Issue of the newspaper Azamn from 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the transcript: "high-ranking parties, hands of the Justice."</seg>
<seg id="2559">Source source: FacebookTwitter of Azamn</seg>
<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the editor Committee, was charged by the ISS before the Special Department, and upon his arrival of security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS took the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had been editor-in-in-Chief of Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed at an indefinite time after the statement had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any other way, including online, starting August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">The first trial before the court in Maskat took place on 26 September 2016 in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both committed to disturbance of the public order, "Missing of the Internet" and "the submarine of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a audience and slander of slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fines at the height of each 3000 oman Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of 1000 Rial (2,600 US dollars) after using the use of "an information network to spread material, which could be found for a risk of public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">Al-Abri was set up a deposit in the amount of 5000 omtian Rial (13 000 US dollars), and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri, a hearing held on 26 December 2016, sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari sentenced to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in a prison sentence of his six-month jail term. al-Haj continues to prison in prison where he served his sentence of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeal chamber also took the decision of the information Ministry to join the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court to allow Azamn, the newspaper sees the paper as before attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Minister of Health issued a statement that was extended by the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Foreign Minister, signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and thus the Minister for the decision of the Appeals Chamber rejected the publication of the newspaper again.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The constant clash of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press was hurt in Oman in the youngest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">To further injuries, for example, closing the site of the independent journal Mowatin, and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the prolonged closure of the Azamn and the inscription of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanian authorities are still not willing to prepare an extensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanian authorities on:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj take him and unconditionally free;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, to create their journalists from their work.</seg>
<seg id="2582">To protect the Press freedom in the country and protect</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstanding</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture with his stories</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is not mentioned in the media only rarely, or not mentioned. this is a growing area that addressed one of the urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Two reasons for the need for local medical research, there are two reasons: for example, a number of medical health, many medications, and vaccines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have in the poorest countries of Africa a widespread effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the Pharmafirmen are a great problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is being carried out by African scientists themselves, with its own research capacity in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for Research of Infectivology in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s at Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic, showed the first gravity effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a degree in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself participated in the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the most effective health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and on the misunderstanding of media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. in addition, I have the sampled national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just stared a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are of your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we are only solutions that have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receiver rather than to be macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where comes the financing and support.</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or hard is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are different well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's hard to find people that come back, or come back here, for the financing and the development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are in your routine research work, which you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure corresponds to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, continuous supply with electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public on science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be trained in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, which should focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, Big Data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and increasing diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this very benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: you can describe the pre- and cons of life as a scientist in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often they are the limited speed, things, and scents access to scientific expertise which represent the challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible to the payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited also of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: as "Open Source" seed producers make the world's global food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports about solutions to environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred back in the USA in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outshredders, the first plant, which has been carried out by NASA astronauts in space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, mortality became work only by its own imaginative and the question how many Salattitudes can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2004, he observed that more Salate were patented and that it could not be used for breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special rotational or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered for more plants such as grain or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeding, environmental protective and expertise for food security to the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of thousands of ancient tradition, Morton still does not use salad, he needs longer, since its work is still longer enough, since its work is still further.</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is, when I would lie in a river a rocky brooks which I have been umptions.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must make this, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he says." I think this patents will go to Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they reach the court, no one can stick to a new salesky, because all features are already patented. "he makes it good as well as possible, tried to kill those characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and to use no material to use, that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that will always be used in the US and everywhere in the world will always be bigger: open source Breeding ("Open Source" -breedings).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red Roman saline of a variety of shredders in the greenhouse station and eaten it. there will be tested, whether plants can be cultivated in space space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name is rather as sound than would be the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open-Source" -seed ") is inspired by the movement for free" Open Source "software, which provides alternatives to a protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in order to ensure that some species of plant species, and could not be protected as a intellectual property, and thus can be used for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeder can't commit that others can use them-free seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to grow and sell it with their seed. "Open Source" breeder allow only others to express their seed, and it is not immediately abolish - two aspects which is forbidden by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">View: view of the dunes</seg>
<seg id="2650">The University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the ability to increase new plants in both food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed is to give him a role in larger connections such as Biodiversity, rights of peasants, control and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try to try, latter is not or little to use with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasized that the "Open-Source" movement is not working with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, genetically modified, or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability in August and September 2016, we would like to know how it is offered for farmstead, it should also know that the type and way should be cultivated as this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">The nutritional value without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the open source Seed Initiative uses to commit their seed to others. in contrast, its procedure is in contrast to the seed, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Support to argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the traditional conveyance due to the increasingly important spiritual property rights on plant-material, which is always available, is essential, is essential.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Managing Director of Ossi, engaged in her thesis with genetischer's variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all the boxes are protected as geared property, so it is not easy to use for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">One question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through their taste or their color improved up to such, due to those of them live in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents on crop protection properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder is due to more patents. genetic diversity is currently less than ever before, because the changes in terms of climate change is much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail address, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity in general and also important for Monsantos. with a total of four major banks and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the United States, the company is responsible for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, however, the view is that the ownership of other breeder systems, as "patents and the protection of crop protection products." a patent is basically a plan where everyone can follow, as soon as the patent pending.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often help this instructions to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">There is such a protection to inhibit innovations, but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent board, conveyance certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for a long time, the plants can be adjusted to the modified environmental conditions, you should have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main relief for Morton is, however, that genetic resources always have been a general public and even should remain in general: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetiere are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to support farmers in their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That's it, that is, and it will be impossible to us that if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, in total, Morton refers to the concept to patented plant characteristics: "we do not create the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants they constitute itself from and as breeder, we needed no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-member, there is still another important aspect of plant breeding: "who knows a variety of species, bred his own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes to the industrial agriculture with large numbers and monocular cultures, to be needed for cultivation in herbicides, bred into the agriculture of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly geared. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While a few medium-sized enterprises (such as monsanto are) patents have the most smaller seed companies - but without patents, they reject them, or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not reworthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding, Frank Morton searches in his breeding garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton. photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder is due to the avoidance of plant patented innovative, "It looks like that I think to produce new efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that argue.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to sell new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are going to sell me into a few years ago, "he says." with a patent for 20 years ago, it is very nice to make my mind about very nice. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">In fact, the United States seem to be a leader in the "Open Source" concept to be the concept spread so quickly to all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "Open-Source" seed, works with farmers and helps them to meet new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it to sell at "Open Source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation has been working on an "Open-Source" license that ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi-commitment to breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breedings differ from land to country, present because the Ossi-commitment is not easy to be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission explains that conventionally bred plants should not be patented, so she says the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows the patents to conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is still no law; now it is on the governments of Member States, to provide patent amt to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source," seed companies and seed companies from all over East Africa to find something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards patentance of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for 'open-source "seed systems, explains that the organization is currently a global alliance for" Open Source "seed systems building, for which the scheduled next year is to drop.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development aid (including Hivos, the International Nonnon-profit aid organisation USC Canada and action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biobiodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed map Project to publish a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of Essens - a consortium of aid organisations have to come to seed, and improve the seed policy, making a stable supply with food and food.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The importance will also be the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a context, by the Luby von Ossi hopes to be able to recognize him more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly be played, and some seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we try to try out the people that even more behind their foods."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and Blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The Egyptian government released the new website for Human Rights Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which reported human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, and said to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The so-called Network for Human Rights Information on the btful and the Constitution. even though it was difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are still exhausted out to overcome the sperm and don't forget to be able to meet our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first to implement a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities more than two months of 21 websites, such as banning, the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking issue of Al Jazeera, due to alleged support for terrorism. "</seg>

<seg id="2728">Alongside ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the Kolumnists and Human Rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles, which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he taught in order to avoid the Zensurination of the Egyptian government, even goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is home to Ziadas blog, is on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces when he took over the students of student and a video, as the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly by politics and the human rights issues in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary there were Ziada to the Spering through the government and reflecting the government, which means that this means:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to spermath is very old, but has not been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the sperm is not meaningful for the world, it is not yet meaningful for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It's succeeded to communicate with me the feeling of a siege of siege; an arrest, deceived was in murder, presummons at the National Security Council, the Spering blogs, and any other web page for whom I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) you have proved that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have the influence when I only have a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to bypass the item of articles to avoid the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they were locked by him, and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug go down the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and expression (AFTE) the Egyptian authorities from May 24 to 06. August 133 pages. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of different internet service providers (ISP), Orange, Vodafone, and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the Spering providers that was possible by creating Internet censorship, and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we realized how the Spering of Web sites, the VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates that the government's intention to continue to block content and filters, to which the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation, in addition, the situation is reduced behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction before the court can proceed against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question: how far, the Egyptian government is ready to go with censorship, and if you're going to attack it as the next attack?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">One day reports from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, the second largest city of the country and home to numerous posters show.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school was shot," and "each second day a police officer was murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe rauben," "", "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air conditioning, to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a portrait of financial situation the violence between 2017 has been the highest level in Rio de Janeiro for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-government organisation Global Justice called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are every day and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, for detailed information on violence in Rio well-known newspaper "Extra" on August 16th, the editorial article "This is not normal," where they arrived, a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The idea for their decision declared the newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to pass over crimes reports that happen in every big city on the world like murder, Raub, sex, etc. everything happens in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our kind to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to conclude that we do not close our eyes before the Grausure.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, chief editor of the journal that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure was:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ruk in a country that is not recognises the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the Zeitung describes that there are according to the information of the Institute for Internal Security, Rio de Janeiro 843 regions, which will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial article, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">In fact, it is aware that a military discretance when he shall be confused, even if he can't be confused, the scamites of the police, which only rule out, and then put questions to grasp.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner is.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Schadet the name "War" more than they are useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued that violence as "War." this is due to their opinion, by the mediated security policy, it might be able to withdraw from the police to calculating the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra charge in the analysis of military exchange rates in Rio itself - in combination with unsufficient investment in personnel, education and historical and self-fake closure of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: Rio de Janeiro's state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>
