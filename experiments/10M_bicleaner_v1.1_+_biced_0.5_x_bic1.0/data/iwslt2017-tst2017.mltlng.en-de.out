that is James R@@ isen .
they may know him because he won as New @-@ York Times re@@ porter the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen had a book in which he published spectacular , that the NSA had illeg@@ ally from Americans by Americans .
however , it &apos;s another chapter to leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c military service , in which the CIA literally set out new dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who the chapter did not look right ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years the government appe@@ aled against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he was appointed the symbol of the Government of the Government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , and journalists .
according to the first constitutional report , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right to use any media information , and if they don &apos;t get the identity of courage to protect them .
so when the government of R@@ isen , he did something that many brave re@@ porter had said to him , saying , he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen thus lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual .
suddenly , although they have been writing for years that it is essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ por@@ ters and springs are always less hidden .
instead , instead , instead , rather get to the statements , that could do his digital foot@@ tracks for him .
and so , the investig@@ ators have wor@@ ried about his individual , his telephone calls was wor@@ ried .
similarly , as its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel tickets with the list of his flights .
in the middle of these information , they found evidence that they used to condem@@ n Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke with his attack , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the justice more condem@@ ns more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government postp@@ oned much of her work as a way .
since September 11 , nearly every article on national security was the result that an W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower became a journalists .
thus , we put the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitutional Compl@@ aints because the government has more possibilities for more possibilities .
but as the technology of the government allowed to avoid the rights of Rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
so , they may take it from the moment when it was contact , rather than in the afternoon , in the case .
today there are communication software that had not been written when R@@ isen had written , and it is considerably more saf@@ er than normal E @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a drop , an open @-@ source monitoring system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by Internet &apos;s famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today I work from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go on a news website , as described here the Washington Post .
there you can send documents up@@ loading or more information , as at any usual contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can &apos;t find more information away secretly , and many of the information that would call them , would not be not available from advance .
all Drop is only a small part of the whole life to protect the Press freedom of the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments on all the world are always new spy technologies that are all dangerous .
it &apos;s to make sure that not only control technology like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to get abnorm@@ ality , it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the above all resi@@ due to the supply of soldiers , modest and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ Street In@@ si@@ der , who warned us to the next financial crisis .
anyway , these technologies are not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 &#91; the &#93; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ äch@@ s@@ men have hidden &#91; more &#93; of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were about 11 million documents of the Muslim @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we receive a impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys are going to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we really see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister is returned .
there are reports that a coalition led by the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad correspondence chess companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to take over a close friend of children &apos;s days , of the famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be there a lot of rich people and others , the nervous system are waiting for the next release , and to the next un@@ revealed documents .
now , like the P@@ lot of an agency of an agency , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems that wine can be removed from you , a common people .
why should we expect what to go ?
but the truth is : if the edges and M@@ äch@@ ler are able to hide your assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not all their taxes , then this means that less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some very few , their assets to hide and wear -- we have to discuss their assets for ten years .
I think many people appears to be confused this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company has another company in another company , in a further company that makes it almost impossible to understand , who is behind these prayers .
it can very difficult to understand the law and control authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society .
I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the US .
presumably because it has not been any other Americans , that came in the revel@@ ations of this sc@@ andal .
well , it is not so that there is no longer Americans who hide your assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , through the principle , after which tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states , less information you need to establish a company to establish a library in order to get a libr@@ arian .
this type of in@@ transparent in the United States has allowed employees of school districts , school children .
it has been permitted , especially suscep@@ tible inc@@ ense to so@@ cks off .
it is this type of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that actually ?
so we sent a investig@@ ator investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as a African minister to buy the money in the US to buy a house , a yacht , a place to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it all except for a lawyer of our investig@@ ators , as he could be trans@@ f@@ ake his money .
these were all pre @-@ bes@@ ity . none of this attor@@ neys took us as clients , and of course there was not handed down with this system . however , this problem shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as single cases .
it does not go to a single lawyer , which has led to our secret investigation .
it does not go around a single top politi@@ cian , have been involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is why the system does work , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
to tackle this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules in order to avoid this type of behavior .
that &apos;s like all very popular sound sound , as if we could do anything against it ; if nothing has changed , as if there are always the edges and M@@ äch@@ s@@ ist .
but as a result , I see how much , I see , it is quite a lot to change .
in the last few years we have seen the privil@@ ege to more transparency , which affects the owners of firms .
the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU in central regi@@ sters are at national level , who really is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them controls .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the U.S. has taken place here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Par@@ isian chambers , but this does not make the progress we would see .
we really would like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure of the world &apos;s huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency to ensure even more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are w@@ ron@@ ged if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind these firms .
we need executives in the economy , which are up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians that recognize the problem , and how to termin@@ ate this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finally finish this type of transparent , which now enables this kind of control , corruption and money la@@ undering , finally end .
this is the story as I had been ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the car boot of a red Maz@@ das would be .
one day after I had finished my design studies , I made a backdoor sale .
a type in red Mazda was still standing and looked out my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city and made a road@@ trip through all the land . afterwards he would go to the Peace scor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was too late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; where you know , because today night ? &quot;
he did not even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what ma@@ ch is now ? &quot;
who knows the situation ?
must I offer a sleeping place ?
but I just met him only ! he says that he would go to the Peace corps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to go on the car for a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage space !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a air conditioned . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; Come , how to do ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed on the blanket and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what I was broken myself ?
a wild @-@ stran@@ ger in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on the ten @-@ door to the door , and my sleep@@ er door completed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact with contact .
the artwork , which he bought from me , depends on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye @-@ angle .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreign : actually , friends , which only were waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air @-@ rats , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air conditioned with .
do we make a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m working on working , almost ple@@ ite , my fellow worker and rent the rent .
I learned about that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were explained .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new fellow worker , Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I met something like we could earn something . our apartment is going to stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; Air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mat@@ h on a wooden floor .
they found it great , and we also found .
I &apos;m sure to make our cheese ham @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we toured with them through the whole city . when we loved our last guest and the door was to the castle , star@@ vation Brian , and I sent to us .
we just discovered that we find new friends and rent our rent ?
the things came into rolling .
my ex @-@ resident , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether it might be a business concept .
we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people open to their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are past .
via the internet , they can then invite you to explore foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next great thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rock@@ et would decrease the rock@@ et .
indeed , however , did not change .
no one who is still very in Tro@@ st , would invest in a shop , which allowed the stran@@ ger to sleep in flats of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all of all that stran@@ ds are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can look at the things you can see good . we were des@@ ig@@ ed .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design has much more than just look and hap@@ tics -- it is the whole experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create design immense trust in people who had never met before .
can design a little bit ?
is it possible to create design confidence ?
I would like to give you a dietary sample , which was degree in trust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will be released from your coming on .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to thank you your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this silent flight from panic that can now feel now -- -- this is exactly what hosts , if it open the first time the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they watch your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ lock cell phone from a stran@@ ger to the hands ?
most people see the responsibility .
so , most guests feel , if they are in different .
only from this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who now has actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could , please note on Twitter , that he adds to the ministry of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
now you have experienced what kind of trust we want . I want to tell you from some discoveries .
what would if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would be seen only once with his name ; if he would have told how he comes to how his dog or his children ?
imagine that you could say 150 Be@@ ur@@ anium are all saying , &quot; He can really hold a very good thing @-@ out cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel like you would have to give your mobile phone ?
a good feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people , negative liberty departments .
finally , we decided to wait to wait until both hosts and guest departments , before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted with Stan@@ ford one study . we examined how likely it is that people rely on each other , dependent on how they are similar to age and home .
little surprisingly we trust the people on most of those who are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less trust we rely on .
this is a natural social Vo@@ cal bias .
it &apos;s exciting when one adds the call of one person -- in our case through payment departments .
if you have less than three payment departments , nothing else .
but one has more than ten , changes all .
a good reputation as well as a good reputation .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep ver@@ itable device .
moreover , we drove that trust is depends on how much you &apos;re up of the price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you &apos;re talking to little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; one gets no reply .
a lot of how for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted by the request .
for example , there is an optimal degree of Off@@ enness , e.g. &quot; T@@ olle art in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can you create it with design to manufacture these degrees .
we use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount text . we also give tips to which issues are little written .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our suburbs .
what we didn &apos;t mean , the great amount of people who had more than willing to cut these pre @-@ parts .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first of all , unbeliev@@ ing good luck .
secondly : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third , a demand that had not covered before .
the business is just very good .
of course there is also times , if not anything smoothly .
there were guests who are not permitted to parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
guests will have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at front front , when it was broken off .
there is nothing to be done as this calls . unfortunately , if I don &apos;t think it &apos;s just .
the dis@@ appointment that was sh@@ ear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation in order to improve us .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 millions , only a fraction is a problem .
for people confi@@ dential itself close to each other .
if confidence work , it can be wonderful .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to the hospital .
it even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers looking at heart activities at heart attacks .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine protection gel which save the life , although they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive a car in the hospital , when you die , and wait for a b@@ ypass tube .
because they don &apos;t want to feel that it feels like books .
you can let a even longer stay , without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
that is , of course , not every stay .
but this relationships behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Sh@@ are Economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept , I asked me :
how does the thought of part with money transactions ?
it goes on an economical trading here .
but it &apos;s just a &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing will not do justice .
Sh@@ are Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people put a part of himself , and that changes all .
if you &apos;re travelling nowadays , this is to compare with Fast food . it is efficient and reliably , but it is less authentic .
however , if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what would be if in any place that we visited , a group there would be able to fill up a group there and one at a pub in a quarter that one has never heard of which one has never heard .
or if you have to learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed following the principle of privacy .
what would if we would like to divide the apartments from the ground up ?
how would look like that ?
what would , if the cities would be able to accept the thoughts by the joint research ?
I invite to me cities that allow us to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
in the South Korea of Seoul , this project was already begun . many car parks , which belonged to the government .
now other inhabitants were offered . students who were searching for a lead .
these children were conve@@ yed to people whose children were started . they were incub@@ ated with incub@@ ator programs .
to study new start @-@ ups in the Sh@@ are Economy : over our platform alone , there are 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries around a guest at a stran@@ ger or self @-@ host .
the idea seems to be crazy , as it was brought to us .
we have not re@@ invented the bike .
hospitality there were even before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has just got our work ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the right design .
design can help us to overcome deep roots .
I find it amazing ,
in particular overwhelming overwhelming .
I have to think about it , if a red Mazda has to pass over .
we don &apos;t know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I ask myself what to make design you want to use design .
thank you .
do you think when you do ?
is a believers ? a experts ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ undering , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay in the safety at the airport .
this is actually true .
I give you not the guil@@ t for your negative impressions .
thus the media people are so look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting on the Islam and Muslims were negative .
studies show : the Americans do not know most of Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great , you know @-@ to meet .
I tell you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am an extremely intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ te ,
and I have a prac@@ tis@@ ing , spiritual mus@@ lim@@ in .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to take me .
no , not as hom@@ eller Man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to carry my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were de@@ posed , &quot; Why do you understand yourself ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Lus@@ com@@ ely was : at that time , there was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and on the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect , and un@@ achiev@@ able beauty .
I haven &apos;t really happened to the faith of my parents .
I have been working with the Koran .
I read it , thought out , thought out in question , desper@@ ate and believed finally ultimately .
my relationship to God was not love on the first sight .
she was confidence and slow dedication , who rose up with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me into wines .
I knew myself myself therein . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever noticed that someone can &apos;t understand you , and that loves that loves ?
it feels like it feel .
later I married and began , as all of good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning was in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen with at the end , I sat down on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express . &quot;
since , smoke , planes fled to buildings , people sp@@ ouses out of the buildings .
what was this ?
is an accident ?
is a technical error ?
my shock turned into indi@@ gn@@ ation quickly in indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should you do something to do ?
I switched to the television channel and heard the ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &#91; ... &#93; , ...
Oh my God .
it is not only my country , but in N@@ u related to the acts of other civil society in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start @-@ up studies .
I remember , as we drove me - so deep it went to my seat , and I went to my seat in my seat , and I took me the first time to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ in .
we moved in this night in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be afraid , &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; Let lead in good lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ering you don &apos;t . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then the day was gathered in that week -- the day in which Muslims gathered for themselves .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I watched the extensive reporting of reporting .
the feelings were under@@ lined , and I heard of attacks on Muslims , or of people who put in Muslims in free and struck in free .
there were really bran@@ dy of mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
however , something felt wasn &apos;t really right .
because the people who had attacked this land , had attacked our country .
I have ra@@ ced the mo@@ ut of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also w@@ aking .
it is not easy to explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the ap@@ ologies which are hard .
today we can really say good@@ bye to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when we will stop them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims defeated and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : we become malign@@ ant or flavor ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor can be found as a whole and a kind of tumors , only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is false .
Muslims are Muslims , as all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the United States , but is an essential organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer , and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will bring the closure of mos@@ ques America ?
it might be a few parking spaces , but not the terror stop .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of different faith of toler@@ ant , and larger citizens .
and how I have a head of police in the Washington area of Washington , DC recently told : people will not actually be radi@@ alized in Mus@@ een .
they are radi@@ alized in their cellar or bed in bed before a computer .
with the radi@@ al process , it is possible that it is possible to make a brain , even by their family , so that the person believes , the terrorists are believed to be the true Muslim , and every one who had their behavior and their ideology , is a rel@@ ying or by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cally , we must stop people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam was a violent religion .
finally , a group is like the IS its brood @-@ ality with the Koran .
when Mus@@ lim@@ in , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add us into their design world when they recogn@@ ises them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology of their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
but if you have a look at them , she does not know what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture . &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality , that they can read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
a prominent Ima@@ m told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they can join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cler@@ gy with whom she had spoken , she brought her wrath to the silence , saying that her wrath , her meaning for the ini@@ quity in the world , she would only bring to trouble in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that could have given their own sense , she was a major objective for the instrument@@ alization through the extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke their solution .
this Ima@@ m put the connection to God and their church .
instead of using them for their w@@ ut , he showed their constru@@ ctive roads for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , kept them to join the IS .
this was an insight , how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia are me and my family concerns .
but how does it acts on normal Americans ?
how does it acts on any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ ence studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , happen at least three things .
we accept rather a author@@ itative government system , con@@ formity and privil@@ eges .
a study shows : if you reported test subjects , in which negative over Muslims reported , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circum@@ c@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this isn &apos;t only an academic problem .
when you look at the mood against Muslims in the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraqi war and during two elect@@ oral periods .
so is Islam@@ opho@@ bia are not simply the natural response to the Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipulation of the public to shut down the foundation of a free company , which had reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
we might see it as the first but the toxic in the fear of fear us .
with the assignment of collective school , it does not only need to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Yus@@ em were a young , married couple who lived in the Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was involved in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , much more ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , more generous man , that she knew .
she visited him , and he revealed her life of life . she was astonishing and said ,
&quot; when is out of my bre@@ asts such a young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne on her brother and his wife , she was murdered , just as the sister of Yus@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her home , as he had made Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ smus is not only un@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we went to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
we loved it and for us it was not a light decision , because the America had said to bring to our children : one that would check us through fear , or one , in which we can do our religion .
we opted for the Mos@@ que .
in our child &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes , went into prayer , and what I saw , let me hold me .
the hall was rest@@ los .
then the Ima@@ m was a announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , A@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack ourselves , but to us .
I have broken up in this moment .
these people were there , because they had courage and comp@@ assion of comp@@ assion and demonstrations .
will you choose ?
what will choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ atics ?
will you go on number one ?
or if you are using , my : we are better than those who are using .
thank you very much .
thank nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a Ner@@ v .
but I ask me what do you say that you may claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mem@@ er with deep ages , work in a no@@ ble@@ ach factory , so an exception and the rule did not rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , I don &apos;t know . I am quite normal . I am quite normal .
I have no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so usually , as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims on all over the world , and I did that , with the largest ever recorded study on Muslims in the whole world , people want to normal things .
you want to live prosperity for the family , they want to work and want them live in peace .
so I am no exception in any sense .
if people like an exception to appear , then the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , there stands shortly before , a commercial store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ package deal in our social awareness , a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live up a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with S@@ elling .
by setting up air motors , high speed and acceleration reached in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to convert tur@@ mo@@ il and react to the nature laws .
today , we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possibility in the autonomous flight .
in order to work an autonomous , it must know it to know it to know where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory in the ETH Zurich , we use only external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic effect .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aviation engine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands will be at highest levels of Eben@@ e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight unit , which tries to beat two fen@@ ders with a folding device .
like other Star@@ r@@ isti@@ gler , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all of their variations .
contrary to most tip , it may be Swedish , so it has a large benefits of start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a cure .
a limitation of rear rigid is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ tions such as wind b@@ ö@@ en .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t be able to restore the optimum position , and the performance can be improved through exercise .
okay . okay .
during our research , we are often basic abstract issues related to the core of the thing .
such a question would be for example : what is the small number of mo@@ vable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a matter .
helicop@@ ters are known for approximately as machines with a thousand mo@@ vable parts , who prepar@@ es to viol@@ ate you .
ahead of decades , trained pilot @-@ controlled flight machines were flying , which had only two mo@@ vable parts : a prop@@ eller and a Heck@@ el .
recently , we discovered that F@@ lies with only one work .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ an , the mechan@@ ically easier remote control . it was recently invented in short .
it has only a mo@@ vable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folding , Schar@@ ni@@ ere and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no other counter@@ s or cont@@ est@@ lo@@ ons , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens to fly very much , so it can be stable and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear of the rear . to get there , I must throw it exactly correctly .
the probability , it &apos;s exactly right when I go all , it is low , that &apos;s why I will show you a video , which was filmed in night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ an exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ gs@@ am@@ ess is this machine to be used here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in excess flow .
do do with all this over@@ flow ?
you see that he is not only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , he is an ambi@@ ence in his orientation .
thereby , he will receive the opportunity to be a big ability .
in the room to move in all directions , no matter in which direction it is shot or even as he is ro@@ asted .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers .
some are in different models , the rest is met directly at the F@@ lies .
see us this .
if flight machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this turns into clock@@ wise direction
and the other against watch @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you rep@@ airing them , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , it is going to go wrong with a motor or prop@@ eller , the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine even if necessary .
we will demonstrate that we have to demonstrate a half of flight .
the last demonstration was a synthetic ch@@ ill .
the major number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and out@@ fit it with loc@@ alized technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit is white , where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you want to make this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine da and I would like to be a f@@ lie@@ zer out of the Lamp@@ en@@ umbrella .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and the Schaff@@ hausen .
it serves as a memory , like wonderful and enchanting , our universe is , and that there are creative , clu@@ stering images allow them to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential , is the Tü@@ zel@@ chen on the i .
thank you very much .
some 1.3 billion years ago , gal@@ axy in a very far distant gal@@ axy two black holes are always faster , you get the mass of three prob@@ es in a ten@@ si@@ le certificate in pure energy .
at this short moment they lit brigh@@ ter than any stars in all gal@@ axi@@ es of the whole universe .
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
they put their energy , but not in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time feelings and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we &apos;re talking about the events at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago was a multi cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has experienced much more : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ ri@@ ans , people and -- God let us see us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a group of particularly aggressive -- Ra@@ i Weiss in the MIT , ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser det@@ ectors to search for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which arise about col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes .
most visited it for crazy .
but enough people called them as crazy Gen@@ ies , so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of absence , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector L@@ IG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometric @-@ Ob@@ servatory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of L@@ IG@@ O increased significantly to increase performance improvement .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
in early September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was launched for a last test run by some smaller , tough problems .
on 14 September 2015 , some days after the commissioning of the Det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two col@@ li@@ ds black holes through the earth .
they went through and me
and through the Det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
my daughter
and the Ab@@ schied was ill out of my new father .
basically , the fruit of my life plant .
all this which I had worked , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he has studied Gra@@ vit@@ ational shafts for 23 years and their ob@@ servat@@ ories , such as L@@ IG@@ O measurement signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is one of herbs in the feelings of space and time .
when pre@@ lu@@ ding the shaft , the room and its entire content will be em@@ bos@@ sed in one direction , and in the other gest@@ ed content .
for deteri@@ oration , do@@ ily in courses for re@@ modeling theory often can be a right @-@ related dance .
while &quot; de@@ w and reservoir , de@@ w and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on the 14th of September , for example , everybody was de@@ posed by us at the end of the waves and stri@@ ving the expansion of an average people at 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after Com@@ ma , followed by a 1 . therefore , we declared the L@@ IG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , it would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ ths of the radius of an atomic probe . this grot@@ esque grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical Tex@@ an on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , which are hunting after the waves : &quot; the technical problems at construction of such det@@ ectors are ra@@ ped .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ alist , and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O would be more than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite convenient . for example , you can manufacture a picture or a map of things to get around the light of several points .
at pot@@ ash is the different .
sounds sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
this is very hard to make it impossible to make a picture of things to produce a lot of things :
around the face of your child .
instead we hear about certain features such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice &quot; now speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she breaks her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
number Bob . &quot;
the same applies for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can &apos;t manufacture these simple pictures of objects in all .
but by writing to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , L@@ IG@@ O are the measured frequencies for L@@ IG@@ O .
so if we convert wave patterns in Sch@@ all , we can hear the all literally .
we would like to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , making my colleague Scott already very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
rot@@ ate the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cu@@ es with an additional sound change . it sounds like to : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu :
it is a kind of motion distribution , expressed into the wave form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 , a date that , at least I heard L@@ IG@@ O following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the device &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what it must be heard of -- SH ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which makes about as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : superior to us , which means that means .
two black holes , the closest body in all , one with a mass of 29 probe , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ ds , surrounded by a hundred times a second , before they are col@@ li@@ red .
these forces are in front of these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
the stable importance of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O eb@@ net has a completely new way to exploring the exploration of the Al@@ ls , as they were never before .
on this way we can listen to all the all @-@ known and the un@@ visible .
much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not see .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why they explo@@ res the stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
but the exciting physical @-@ outputs , however , are hidden in the core , which lies behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we never shall see , since this op@@ ak are never seen .
gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ perme@@ ates iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it as the Ur@@ cris@@ p covers his own night @-@ lights .
using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that all things exist in all things , which we never have never seen , that we have never seen , and of whom we have never seen , that we don &apos;t have to discover that we were able to discover .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O found equal in the first step of things that we did not expect .
my colleague to MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes as L@@ IG@@ O them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , old @-@ old body from prehistoric times . the black holes are possible to say the Sau@@ ri@@ ers for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O gives us a completely different angles of angles at all , to the emergence of the stars and finally , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be so brave like only possible .
thanks to L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build a great det@@ ectors and the Rau@@ schen and Circus of Cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ servat@@ ories - a brand new generation of Ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and All .
for what could be more beautiful than the Ur@@ cris@@ y itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dreams with us .
thank you .
some time , I was an experiment from the experiment .
a year I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; say , before I was afraid .
no matter whether it made me nervous , me into un@@ pleasant situations I zw@@ ang me , &quot; Yes . &quot;
wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live in television ?
no , but yes !
wanted to start with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I cast my fear .
my fear to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , changed me .
but there was a particular note that my life is deeply changed , on an unexpected Art. It began with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the most beautiful , called for un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
if she would be a cell@@ ner@@ ed in the South .
&quot; state , &quot; I needed milk for my sn@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me once , when I could play with her , when I was straight on the jump . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I sw@@ ung me , always with them , as soon as you call me . no matter what I just do , or when I am , I say , I say Yes , each one time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I be@@ ati@@ fied me .
it has a magic effect on me , to my children , on our family .
but it has also an amazing tribut@@ ors : just before short , I actually got entirely that the &quot; Yes &quot; S@@ agen to play my career with my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things from , raised to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I live TV . I live television . I have been broad@@ cast@@ ed television .
I do not make television , in big style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for this , 70 hours program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows , simultaneously in production .
every programme offers hundreds of jobs that not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days in four shows , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are in succession on Thursday evening .
all over the world are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers throughout the world .
my brain is globally globally , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ cast@@ ed , I have been created and not only produced , so even though I need to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of bon@@ fires to gather my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes this ?
no one , I am a titanium .
dream job .
I would like to print it all of them .
I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; Author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that you have a company , a country or a class@@ room , take you to understand that I &apos;m not only about computer and imagin@@ able , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that there is a dream job at a dream job .
it &apos;s all of a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I noticed to the work , there is no other feeling .
my work is always a country from the Nich@@ ts .
it is , when I founded the troops , I painted on a canvas .
so as a portrait you have a high sound , and run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all that is at the same time .
I love it to work . I love it .
she is tri@@ pod , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , and wor@@ sen@@ ing , funny and mat@@ ernal , funny and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable , cruel and reasonable , and the best of it is the sums .
there are so a change in me when the work is well running .
a sw@@ men begins in my head , and it grows and growing , and the sums sounds like a busy road , I could always travel to her .
many people take up , if I heard them the sums of the sums , that I know that the writing is good .
do not understand me wrong , that is doing .
but the sums -- when I began with the TV production began when I began to work and collabor@@ ating , build up , to create and work , I discovered this thing that sums up this sums !
the sums up is more than writing .
the sums is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the sums is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have so a sums , you can &apos;t do differently than after the size .
the feeling , not differently can be used , as far as size , regardless , for which price .
this calls the sums up .
or maybe , there is also a work@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know it .
I know only that I &apos;m not going for the failure , and I know that I love the sums .
I want to tell you , I am a titanium , and I know that I will not want to put it in question .
to make one clear thing : the successful I &apos;ll be able to find more broad@@ casts , the more epic borders , the more work there is , the more things , the more things , the more things , the more or more . I love story , the more expectations .
ever more I work out , in order to be successful , the more must work myself .
what I said to work ?
I love working , not true ?
the country , which I cast , the marathon , which I drive up , the army , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the sums of the sums .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only do this sums ?
and then stop the sums .
over@@ looks , over@@ clo@@ ves , burned out .
the sums stop .
now my three daughters to the truth is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is one of the only labour market .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write from my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; export , I want to go to Sh@@ onda Land . &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
you are baby @-@ titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums up .
the sums of the engine is hidden .
I love my job not anymore . the engine was out of .
the sums was not back .
my sums was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , carried out weekends , no Reu@@ ben , no Reu@@ ben , not del@@ ays , but don &apos;t know , with all the hearts , clear eyes , whatever always .
there was no sums .
I was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show @-@ display ,
everything was gray , I had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything that I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
so what does one does , if that is doing , the work that is love , suddenly f@@ ading ?
I know , some games think : &quot; gr@@ l you from , da@@ ö@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know how to be doing a teacher , a mother who loves to be a painter , Bill Gates , one who loves the sums of the sums , and know how to the sums of the sums up , if you know the sums up , if the sums stop , who is one ?
what are you ?
what I am ?
I still have a titanium ?
if the song of my heart sounds , I can survive in silence ?
and then I put my &quot; southern states &quot; in a question . &quot;
I am on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; Mama is mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I want to say , saying , No two things shall be aware of me :
first of all , I need to say Yes , and secondly , they called me . &quot;
she calls anymore &quot; press &quot; . &quot;
when is what happened ?
I hate it when I am titanium and my sums up , and here changes all my own eyes .
and so she says : &quot; m@@ um , mag@@ st you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
nothing is very special .
we play and her sisters here , we are much and I read quite dramatic out of the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the case of the sums , I can do nothing to fit apart .
I am focuss@@ ed .
I &apos;m quiet@@ ly quiet@@ ly .
the country , which I cast , the marathon , the marathon , the army , the army , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists there are sti@@ cky fingers and a feu@@ d@@ rank , delicate , juni@@ per , and the song , in which it gets fun , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron @-@ gin &apos; .
everywhere , peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so that I can hardly breathe deeply .
I hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
it dis@@ sol@@ ves something in me .
an ment@@ ale door goes to and an energy boost comes .
it is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sums comes slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sums , but a sums .
and now I feel a magic mystery , I would like to know a magic mystery .
let us remain in the case .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . no secret .
it is something that we have forgotten .
the sums of the workers , the work of titanium , that is only the replacement .
if I qu@@ ery , if I tell you , who I am , if I am going to refer to the programs and television hours and how do my brain is , I don &apos;t forget what the real sums up .
the sums is no power and it is not working specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the genuine sums is dependent on the love .
the sums of the sums is the power that comes from the life of life .
the genuine sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignored the pressure of history , which is to do di@@ pping tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the genuine sums is simple and original .
the real sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe that God gave me the wrong words , because the God told me that I am a titanium ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my kid wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am the fixed rule , so I can liber@@ ate me as a work@@ olic of any debt .
it is Law , I don &apos;t have any choice . I don &apos;t have any choice if I want to hear the sums .
wish , it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
play me not ans@@ at@@ able as working as work .
the truth is true ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , for I love it .
I prefer to stay at the workplace as home .
this con@@ fession would be painful , for what a man works better than to be at home ?
well , I am .
hon@@ est@@ ly hon@@ est@@ ly hon@@ est@@ ly Me myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too high , none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we will sing and play Ball .
we cr@@ ushed Sei@@ fen@@ bl@@ ender .
thereby I feel predominantly sti@@ f , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always get after my mobile phone .
but it is O.@@ K .
my sons will show me how to know , and the sums of the universe met me .
I &apos;m playing and games until I ask me : why do we have one of the games ?
you can also say it ! let &apos;s always say Yes , if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a day .
there you are quite right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child takes you less interesting when you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they are einf@@ alls something different .
it are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , you will be replaced by Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
and if my teen@@ ager daughter has 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece , even at a Schle@@ mm @-@ attitude !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile phone , no ling@@ erie .
the day is short : dinners , the children &apos;s finished .
but 15 minutes are not possible !
my children are my chari@@ ots , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel that sums up to feel a place for peace and peace .
it doesn &apos;t go about games with their own children . it is joy to joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can enjoy the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out it and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I am happy and I won victories . friends meet , books , day and enjoy the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re playing for everything that I was abandoned , when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training when I wanted to ask myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why did not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums of the sums was back in my leisure time . the sums seem to return if I am not working .
work does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens . I listen to me in my office . I listen to me in my office . I listen to me with new ideas . I have put me into new ideas . I get back to new ideas . I bes@@ ze it in full moves and love my work again .
I like the sums , but I love it not .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sums of the sums , the sums is not ... no more .
soap and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sums .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of the work is part of me , but only a part . and therefore I am grat@@ eful .
it &apos;s me to me that I am a titanium . I never saw a titanium , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes too much work and more games .
but I still have everything in the handle . my brain is still functional . my brain is still working .
ever I &apos;m playing , the happy , I and my children .
ever more I &apos;m playing , the more feel I feel as a good mother .
ever I &apos;m playing , the clear is my head .
ever I &apos;m playing , the better I work .
the more I &apos;m playing , the more I listen to the sums . the country , which I walk , the marathon , the troops , the sw@@ amp , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sw@@ men , the sums of life : the sums of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more making this unusual , be@@ aked , naked and new life @-@ feeling in me . less titanium -- more I !
ever more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know , who I am .
I am author . I think things that I raised up to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this jobs ,
the dream job should be a bit no@@ umer@@ ical .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too much work and more games .
titles have no chance here .
do you play ? &quot;
thank you nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgical .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human load of human rights .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy impact or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organic , has a very low power to self @-@ thei@@ rs .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a stable , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
certainly it is one of the most famous , the &quot; Tiefen@@ hir@@ sch &quot; . this im@@ plant@@ ing is an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of ne@@ ons so that the neurological function improves the neurological function .
it is actually an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered serious quotes and severe pain .
in Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not use Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
we went to this dream come true .
I want to show you that we are very close near .
with a little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was the managing director and worked day and night at not@@ ing .
often used patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at sk@@ ull @-@ mil@@ n trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain an@@ schw@@ ill@@ ite and the sk@@ ul@@ ant pressure will be inc@@ lined .
in order to save the life , you must reduce the sk@@ ul@@ ant pressure .
therefore , you must remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
that &apos;s no easy task .
cells of a tissue piece is to grow , comparable with quite small children , that are taken out of your family .
you must find the correct nutrition , temperature , moisture and environments to blos@@ som the environments .
exactly that we had to make this cells with this cells .
by many attempts , Jean @-@ François .
it looked at his micro@@ scope under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as such as a regular cell culture . with great green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ affected cells .
perhaps you don &apos;t know from the bi@@ ologi@@ co lessons that stem cells are in@@ able cells that can turn into each cell type of organism .
the adult brain has a stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprisingly , this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain tissue in surgery are preserved .
we had another fascinating observation : normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they die never , they are immort@@ al .
but this cells were different .
they distributed slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that saw the stem cells , but looked otherwise stated .
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they stem from this cells .
this blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have all in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
you play an important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us the fet@@ us can provide for the feeding of the brain .
why they will receive us ?
we don &apos;t know .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher levels near brain trau@@ ma .
but that &apos;s not so safe .
one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source , the brain is possible .
we had to prove it .
so , we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ speaking area and then the cells just as strong as it did Jean François @-@ François
and they subsequently bl@@ acks that in the brain , in order to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step , we have seen them at the removal of the same individu@@ um .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ gra@@ t .
one of our first questions : what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue tissue re@@ im@@ pl@@ ess@@ ary ? and what will happen when we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells into a cereb@@ ral brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we observed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been given back after several weeks , they were back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we were able to injury an injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew by neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , these are these little points . these are the cells that we were color in vitro , in the culture .
we were of course not heard of course .
help this cells also to recover from a brain injury ?
so tra@@ iled monkeys with a manual test task .
they had to take feed pellets of a tray .
they made very well .
when they had achieved a stable performance level , the last we achieved in the motor Cort@@ ex in the motor Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were f@@ lown , they were not able to move their hand .
just like it would happen in people , they re@@ covering spont@@ aneously until a certain degree , just as according to a stroke .
the patients are se@@ wn and then try them with the help of plastic mechanisms . they can recover at a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of the spontaneous recovery , im@@ planted we had its own cells .
on the left side , see the monkeys that re@@ covering spont@@ aneously .
he can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance by the violation of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you now see when we were re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same A@@ ffe , two months after the maturity .
I can tell you , that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about this cells .
we can freeze them and use later .
we can use them in other neurop@@ athy models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still forever , but in people to im@@ plant@@ ing people .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives you to healing himself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Fr . Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I am sure - several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need this . &quot;
I definitely have any case .
of course , the question of what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies at the people .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill up two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies .
BG : that is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG said : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years will come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then , one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select the treatment courses , and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , one must apply to a multi@@ centre study .
you must really believe that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TE@@ D and that you &apos;re told us .
many thanks .
democracy .
in the West , we make a great mistake to consider it as of course .
we see the democracy not as the fragile plant , which is in reality but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ altered ground .
we believe that capitalism are inevit@@ ably to democracy .
it is true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy at us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it became clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not affect the austerity programs , which have been realised in Greece .
in this moment , I thought that there might be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my mind that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if they would like anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy .
in order to believe me with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sive and defense democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are mixed , our future nozzle and our great , new technologies .
for the subject : I would like to talk to an interesting country , which currently being threatened by our economic activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am the &quot; Twin &quot; Par@@ ad@@ ox @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known for you . they know it and recognize him as the Deb@@ berg , who gives its long shadow over the USA , Europe , and all the world .
we all recognize the Deb@@ berg ,
but only a few acknow@@ ledge his &quot; s &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mountain of wast@@ ed cash that are , however , are to invest there , however , to invest more productive and income , with whom you could wear the debt , and even all the things could produce mankind , for example , the green &quot; green &quot; energy .
I have two numbers .
over the past three months were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , to invest 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars , such as industry facilities , machines , office building , schools , roads , wind @-@ quiet , equipment , and so on .
a $ 3,4 trillion U.S. dollar spent a lot of money down to it &apos;s $ 5.1 trillion in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time and all financial institutions around the same time , except the stock markets and the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital , the twin summit , which are not out of the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan and Europe , who could not invest low demand in which they could not invest it . just like stoves &apos;s father , who could kill him that his son would kill him when he will grow .
the circumstances leads to the circumstances that lead him k@@ itt@@ led him .
this is my Ha@@ ders with capitalism --
its extremely productive capital should be employed by all the in@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives and develop particularly all the technologies to finance , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth .
so , democracy is the solution ?
I think we think . but before we continue : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the corporate form and control the poor as a majority .
the ath@@ ic democracy closed course to many of --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would be a mistake to get the job value of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these remedi@@ es .
the decision at the ath@@ ic democracy which was , and it is not only the right to free use of freedom , but even more important and decision that they had the right to political ten@@ sion@@ er with the same vocal weigh@@ ting in questions of state aid .
the ath@@ ic democracy hasn &apos;t been held long --
like a not@@ ch , which is very bright , it is also fast growing .
however , our present @-@ liberal democra@@ cies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens .
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the U.S. Constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , who ultimately became a set for prev@@ ailing .
the liberal democracy came only to , when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible , and the democratic process was placed on the policy , while the economy - the world of concert -- a democratic zone has been added .
in our today &apos;s democra@@ cies , since the time , in which the separation of politics and the economy began , an im@@ migrant struggle between the two companies by the economy and to emi@@ gr@@ ate the politics .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians did not have more so like earlier ?
it lies not on an de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is in fact that in the government it can be in the government and nevertheless not on power because the power of the policy is divided into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ ders with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of smoking , which so on the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , they proclaimed that they will be hungry by the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that brought politics as far as the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the companies grows , im@@ balances , mac@@ ro@@ economic demand , and the managing director of the corporations are to be fri@@ gh@@ tened by cash of their companies .
one of the successful capitalism in capitalism &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour force and the welfare of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy would be better , if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; control is ret@@ ains , like in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and the fore@@ igner .
this is no new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t go son@@ ly well .
the lesson of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor kill themselves through a miracle , like in the ancient Athens , without a new species of brut@@ ality and disappearance .
there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by using Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ bell and replaced by automation and robots .
the problem is that for a long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin people will be deeper than the waste of the waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it will be very soon as I believe in countries like China .
so we have to join the economy and the economy and politics again , and in order to make sure that we can be re @-@ established in an disease hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cker , which lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so , the question is not whether the capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he will survive ;
the most interesting question is to be similar to capitalism by a D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy , in which the society has used to serve people into the exploration of life , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ os &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions with the meaning of life .
I think we are allowed to be optimistic .
so what would like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like the utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like similar D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the practical implementation .
in the field of companies : imagine a capital market , where you can see money , while you are working in one of the next capital , by a company to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one has just been working -- is the ownership of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital , and rede@@ em , and the concept of the wage work is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but the company does not work there , and employees that the company does not belong to the capital . no tau@@ ter will be between investment and labour , no great g@@ aps between investment and savings , and finally no empor@@ ra@@ ctive summit .
in the area of global economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have free fluctu@@ ated exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , will be issued in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , -- we will call them &quot; Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos , &quot; -- and any government paid the sum that meets the trade deficit or the trade balance of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment resources are ra@@ zed .
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es had proposed a conference in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one could not implement the technical funds then at that time .
today , we have , especially in particular in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world , which I enter you at the same time , is the same time , in which the separation of capital and labour will be buried in the gar@@ bage collection of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ze as well as ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ ze .
but above all others it is a world where we can introduce ourselves a real democracy .
we will w@@ aking up in such a world
or we will drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ ro@@ scopy ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Fr . Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you &apos;ll find yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ ating Mar@@ xi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and business is ... T@@ un we don &apos;t know the technological development will generate a massive decline in all @-@ economic demand that Larry Sum@@ atra &apos;s &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of these crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only need our democratic dest@@ abil@@ ise , but also the countries whose interest has been low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant to be relevant .
likewise as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist living and , like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am a perfect wir@@ r .
BG : actually , and now we are also there too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t have a wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG said : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who told Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have to keep it very clear what you keep from the perspective of the West .
would you like to repeat here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large degree of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the call of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we said the democracy to the policy , while the area is playing , -- the area of the economy - a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense if I can say that this is a prov@@ oking , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- we remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism and democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical , which affects the democratic development .
what you can watch out in China , resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now come to do so what the West in the 19th century itself has done ra@@ ving to Heu@@ chel@@ ei .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as financial minister of Greece from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that the coming comes .
BG said : yes ...
how to look six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing , for we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone .
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , by the self @-@ f@@ ake to adopt , and the lasting ver@@ dicts that a massive decline was threatened by the Eurozone , and continue to rise to the development of the European Union .
we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek continent -- the way , the first sugges@@ tion was revealed , who has revealed these ver@@ and@@ ing .
unfortunately , the boys within the euro zone , in the euro@@ zone , continues to continue the mer@@ its of the euro zone .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union .
if one is trying to get an economic system , which is not superior to receive by political will and authori@@ zation on the life , you may have any time a while , but if the change comes , it happens ab@@ rupt and destro@@ y@@ able .
BG : what To you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we did not change their structure .
BG : have made any mistakes in your time as financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG said to the example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest .
if there is an Minister for Finance , or any minister , which , after 6 months in office , is , in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it &apos;s not a dangerous person .
of course I made error .
the biggest mistakes was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a huge interest on pages of money , a common solution .
but that gave it .
they wanted to bring to the case only our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the plans to run by the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t know that they have passed a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c program for 5 years since 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ in@@ ous GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika of money , which has imposed us these policy , conf@@ essed that : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive type of talks , they seem to be quite per @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
it is my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , from Yemen , who lives in Europe and loves to love .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone is not survived .
for if they did not survive , the demon@@ stra@@ igh@@ ties were demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this is not alone for Europe &apos;s cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c episodes , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we have taken the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be less expensive for the future of Europeans , as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope to be wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , many thanks , that you were at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of Roy Price have never heard most even though he is responsible for 22 medium @-@ term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy ago three years ago .
Roy Price is the executive positions at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slender , has a I@@ yel@@ low@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for this shows , shows the shows and the content of the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any any time .
he must find shows , which are very good .
in other words , he must find shows shows that there are quite right on this curve .
this curve is the valuation of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating will show from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating .
will receive your show with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
they are shows as &quot; Break@@ ing bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , ad@@ dic@@ tive , where you have one night , your brain tells : &quot; where there is more of these episodes ? &quot;
this type of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows shows as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should be enough to say that at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not respond to the right side of the curve on the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
it &apos;s more thoughts about the mean out@@ age , the average television -- the shows which are neither good even bad , they don &apos;t miss it .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course there is also the first time that Amazon is so something that Amazon is nothing to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a competition , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and represents them online where they can see every free .
and if Amazon is free to make things that you do , correct ?
millions of people look forward to this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they should be observed with the check in this shows .
they are observed in Roy and his team , who won everything .
you capture , when you start the show , when you are at , that parts you turn , or again at once again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , what show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a seat of four republi@@ can US Senate . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone knows the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7,5 -- is a little over the average , but not just what is Roy and his team .
about the same time in another company there is a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy &apos;s searching for a super @-@ show and it also uses data , but it makes it something different .
instead of a competition , he and his team will present the existing data via the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so on reviews they give the shows , which shows the shows , which shows you like etc .
then , they use this data to find this small details about the viewer : what shows they like the producers , which actors .
when they were together all the parts , they went up a car , and decided to make a seat of a seat on four channels , but a drama of a drama with a Senator .
know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; has a 9,1 @-@ rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , is the question : what happened here ?
it has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data and it &apos;s great for one of them , but not for the other company .
? is what is what ?
because the logic states that it should work with everything should work .
if one collects millions of data , for a decision which you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized by very high performance computers .
the Min@@ de@@ ste what you can expect , is good TV , or ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is a little fri@@ gh@@ tening , because we live in a time , in which we live more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions about television .
knows someone here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come to touch in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in the USA in jail and in order to dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is done or not .
just like on Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , will be chosen whether a person is good or bad .
mean television , 22 minutes , that can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results . that &apos;s not remember that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data are also wrong .
yes , even Google makes it sometimes error .
in 2009 , Google announced that it can say through data analysis of the flu , the lim@@ iting species , predi@@ ctions -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it was wonderful and was a great news channel . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it works fine , year to year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work properly ,
and no one could say why .
it was simply not simply that this was again a sensation , including the Resistance of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data is sealed , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes a little bit .
despite all of these mistakes the data regarding decisions in the decisions of life - -- at the workplace , in the study of law , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I &apos;m working in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very clever people are un@@ acceptable for a lot of data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years , I realized some pattern on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
do you need to solve a complex problem , do you do most of two things :
as a result , you can analyse this problem in its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , put the individual parts back together to touch a resolution .
sometimes you have to do it several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to put a problem with and understand his parts .
you are not suitable to put the parts back again , and then to a resolution .
there is a different tool and we have all : our brain .
if something is something , in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is not complete , in order to touch a good order - especially if it is the brain of a experts .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have not used it and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
you can use data to understand their audience , for which they were not able to do so . but the decision to put all these parts , put together and have a show as &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that stood not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
on the way , in contrast , this was the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were voted for TV &apos;s ideas as they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision because she could always say : &quot; tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I think things will be wrong when data started to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and not forget to forget this device is quite useful .
you will find many of you ...
before there was data , this tool was to make the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also known as Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question , you have to shake just the ball to get a reply . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll see it later with a technical demo .
so I &apos;ve arrived some decisions in my life , but I would have heard on the ball on the ball .
but as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace these by something much more sophisticated , as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this is changed the basic structure .
so maybe the ball goes and sophisticated and the peaks . eventually , it &apos;s enough to meet decisions , if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data , there is to be paid to make decisions that is to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end there are not the data , but the risks involved in which you will land at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
