<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him because he won as New-York Times reporter the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen had a book in which he published spectacular, that the NSA had illegally from Americans by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it's another chapter to leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic military service, in which the CIA literally set out new drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who the chapter did not look right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government appealed against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he was appointed the symbol of the Government of the Government, Whistleblower, and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional report, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right to use any media information, and if they don't get the identity of courage to protect them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government of Risen, he did something that many brave reporter had said to him, saying, he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen thus lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been writing for years that it is essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs are always less hidden.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, instead, instead, rather get to the statements, that could do his digital foottracks for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so, the investigators have worried about his individual, his telephone calls was worried.</seg>
<seg id="21">Similarly, as its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel tickets with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke with his attack, Whistleblower, but instead, the justice more condemns more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government postponed much of her work as a way.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, nearly every article on national security was the result that an Whistleblower became a journalists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the press work on the game that is protected by the first constitutional Complaints because the government has more possibilities for more possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="28">But as the technology of the government allowed to avoid the rights of Reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">So, they may take it from the moment when it was contact, rather than in the afternoon, in the case.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not been written when Risen had written, and it is considerably more safer than normal E-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a drop, an open-source monitoring system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by Internet's famous Aaron Swartz, and today I work from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go on a news website, as described here the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can send documents uploading or more information, as at any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can't find more information away secretly, and many of the information that would call them, would not be not available from advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">All Drop is only a small part of the whole life to protect the Press freedom of the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments on all the world are always new spy technologies that are all dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's to make sure that not only control technology like Edward Snowden have a possibility to get abnormality, it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The above all residue to the supply of soldiers, modest and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a WallStreet Insider, who warned us to the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Anyway, these technologies are not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 [the] "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Mächsmen have hidden [more] of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were about 11 million documents of the Muslim-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We receive a impression of how customers, banks and attorneys are going to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the e-mails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister is returned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that a coalition led by the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad correspondence chess companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars on Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to take over a close friend of children's days, of the famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be there a lot of rich people and others, the nervous system are waiting for the next release, and to the next unrevealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, like the Plot of an agency of an agency, or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems that wine can be removed from you, a common people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we expect what to go?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the edges and Mächler are able to hide your assets in tax havens, and not all their taxes, then this means that less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, as secret tax havens are used by some very few, their assets to hide and wear -- we have to discuss their assets for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears to be confused this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has another company in another company, in a further company that makes it almost impossible to understand, who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can very difficult to understand the law and control authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because it has not been any other Americans, that came in the revelations of this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not so that there is no longer Americans who hide your assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, through the principle, after which tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">We would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states, less information you need to establish a company to establish a library in order to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparent in the United States has allowed employees of school districts, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been permitted, especially susceptible incense to socks off.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a investigator investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as a African minister to buy the money in the US to buy a house, a yacht, a place to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it all except for a lawyer of our investigators, as he could be transfake his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-besity. none of this attorneys took us as clients, and of course there was not handed down with this system. however, this problem shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not go to a single lawyer, which has led to our secret investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It does not go around a single top politician, have been involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is why the system does work, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">To tackle this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to avoid this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">That's like all very popular sound sound, as if we could do anything against it; if nothing has changed, as if there are always the edges and Mächsist.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a result, I see how much, I see, it is quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen the privilege to more transparency, which affects the owners of firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU in central registers are at national level, who really is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them controls.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. has taken place here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both Parisian chambers, but this does not make the progress we would see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We really would like to see how this Panama disclosure of the world's huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency to ensure even more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are wronged if they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind these firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy, which are up and say, "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians that recognize the problem, and how to terminate this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally finish this type of transparent, which now enables this kind of control, corruption and money laundering, finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I had been abducted and in the car boot of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had finished my design studies, I made a backdoor sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in red Mazda was still standing and looked out my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city and made a roadtrip through all the land. afterwards he would go to the Peace scorps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was too late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him, "where you know, because today night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He did not even worse: "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What mach is now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Must I offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him only! he says that he would go to the Peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to go on the car for a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a air conditioned. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" Come, how to do? "</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared on the blanket and thought: "Oh Mann! what I was broken myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild-stranger in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on the ten-door to the door, and my sleeper door completed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact with contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he bought from me, depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye-angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as foreign: actually, friends, which only were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air-rats, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air conditioned with.</seg>
<seg id="123">Do we make a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm working on working, almost pleite, my fellow worker and rent the rent.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned about that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were explained.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to turn fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new fellow worker, Brian Chesky: "Brian, I met something like we could earn something. our apartment is going to stay in a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">"" "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "Airmatratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air math on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we also found.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to make our cheese ham-ham-Omelted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we loved our last guest and the door was to the castle, starvation Brian, and I sent to us.</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we find new friends and rent our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My ex-resident, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether it might be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented ourselves to investors: "we would like to create a website, on the people open to their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are past.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the internet, they can then invite you to explore foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next great thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would decrease the rocket.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, however, did not change.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very in Trost, would invest in a shop, which allowed the stranger to sleep in flats of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all of all that strands are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can look at the things you can see good. we were desiged.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design has much more than just look and haptics -- it is the whole experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create design immense trust in people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design a little bit?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a dietary sample, which was degree in trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will be released from your coming on.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to thank you your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight from panic that can now feel now -- -- this is exactly what hosts, if it open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they watch your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlock cell phone from a stranger to the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people see the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most guests feel, if they are in different.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only from this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who now has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could, please note on Twitter, that he adds to the ministry of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">Now you have experienced what kind of trust we want. I want to tell you from some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would be seen only once with his name; if he would have told how he comes to how his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you could say 150 Beuranium are all saying, "He can really hold a very good thing-out cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel like you would have to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A good feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people, negative liberty departments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait to wait until both hosts and guest departments, before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted with Stanford one study. we examined how likely it is that people rely on each other, dependent on how they are similar to age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people on most of those who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we rely on.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social Vocal bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It's exciting when one adds the call of one person -- in our case through payment departments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three payment departments, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes all.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation as well as a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep veritable device.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we drove that trust is depends on how much you're up of the price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you're talking to little, such as "Hi!," one gets no reply.</seg>
<seg id="189">A lot of how for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted by the request.</seg>
<seg id="190">For example, there is an optimal degree of Offenness, e.g. "Tolle art in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to manufacture these degrees.</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text area to recommend the correct amount text. we also give tips to which issues are little written.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't mean, the great amount of people who had more than willing to cut these pre-parts.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all, unbelieving good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Secondly: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also times, if not anything smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are not permitted to parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Guests will have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at front front, when it was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing to be done as this calls. unfortunately, if I don't think it's just.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was shear in the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation in order to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 millions, only a fraction is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people confidential itself close to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If confidence work, it can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">It even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers looking at heart activities at heart attacks.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are genuine protection gel which save the life, although they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a car in the hospital, when you die, and wait for a bypass tube.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel that it feels like books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can let a even longer stay, without the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">That is, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationships behind the pure monetary policy are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept, I asked me:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It goes on an economical trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just a "rental industry," the thing will not do justice.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of himself, and that changes all.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you're travelling nowadays, this is to compare with Fast food. it is efficient and reliably, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">However, if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What would be if in any place that we visited, a group there would be able to fill up a group there and one at a pub in a quarter that one has never heard of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you have to learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed following the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would if we would like to divide the apartments from the ground up?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would look like that?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would, if the cities would be able to accept the thoughts by the joint research?</seg>
<seg id="238">I invite to me cities that allow us to society and relations, instead of loneliness and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In the South Korea of Seoul, this project was already begun. many car parks, which belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Now other inhabitants were offered. students who were searching for a lead.</seg>
<seg id="241">These children were conveyed to people whose children were started. they were incubated with incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">To study new start-ups in the Share Economy: over our platform alone, there are 785 000 people in 191 countries around a guest at a stranger or self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be crazy, as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the bike.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there were even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just got our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the right design.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">In particular overwhelming overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda has to pass over.</seg>
<seg id="253">We don't know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I ask myself what to make design you want to use design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">Do you think when you do?</seg>
<seg id="257">Is a believers? a experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain laundering, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the safety at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you not the guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people are so look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting on the Islam and Muslims were negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans do not know most of Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great, you know-to meet.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am an extremely introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatite,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I have a practising, spiritual muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to take me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homeller Man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to carry my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were deposed, "Why do you understand yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"" "the Luscomely was: at that time, there was a feminist declaration of independence, and on the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, I felt a perfect, and unachievable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I haven't really happened to the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been working with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought out, thought out in question, desperate and believed finally ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love on the first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was confidence and slow dedication, who rose up with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me into wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I knew myself myself therein. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever noticed that someone can't understand you, and that loves that loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like it feel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, as all of good Egyptians, my career as an engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning was in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen with at the end, I sat down on the screen and saw the word "Express."</seg>
<seg id="293">Since, smoke, planes fled to buildings, people spouses out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">Is an accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">Is a technical error?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something to do?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard the... "Muslim terrorists"...,... "in the name of Islam..."... [...],...</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country, but in Nu related to the acts of other civil society in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to go into a new city and start-up studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we drove me - so deep it went to my seat, and I went to my seat in my seat, and I took me the first time to be recognized as Muslimin.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved in this night in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be afraid," Seid careful, "Let lead in good lighted areas," "Versammmering you don't."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then the day was gathered in that week -- the day in which Muslims gathered for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I watched the extensive reporting of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were underlined, and I heard of attacks on Muslims, or of people who put in Muslims in free and struck in free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really brandy of mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">However, something felt wasn't really right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land, had attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have raced the mout of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also waking.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the apologies which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can really say goodbye to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When we will stop them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims defeated and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: we become malignant or flavor?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be found as a whole and a kind of tumors, only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are Muslims, as all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the United States, but is an essential organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer, and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will bring the closure of mosques America?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might be a few parking spaces, but not the terror stop.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of different faith of tolerant, and larger citizens.</seg>
<seg id="333">And how I have a head of police in the Washington area of Washington, DC recently told: people will not actually be radialized in Museen.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radialized in their cellar or bed in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">With the radial process, it is possible that it is possible to make a brain, even by their family, so that the person believes, the terrorists are believed to be the true Muslim, and every one who had their behavior and their ideology, is a relying or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radically, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam was a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group is like the IS its brood-ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslimin, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add us into their design world when they recognises them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology of their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you have a look at them, she does not know what they are in their "Holy Scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality, that they can read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent Imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they can join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought her wrath to the silence, saying that her wrath, her meaning for the iniquity in the world, she would only bring to trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that could have given their own sense, she was a major objective for the instrumentalization through the extremists who spoke their solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam put the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of using them for their wut, he showed their constructive roads for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, kept them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, how the Islamophobia are me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it acts on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it acts on any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- show: if we fear ourselves, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather a authoritative government system, conformity and privileges.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you reported test subjects, in which negative over Muslims reported, they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This isn't only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at the mood against Muslims in the above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- this three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraqi war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So is Islamophobia are not simply the natural response to the Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulation of the public to shut down the foundation of a free company, which had reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might see it as the first but the toxic in the fear of fear us.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective school, it does not only need to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusem were a young, married couple who lived in the Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was involved in the dental faculty, talented, much more...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, more generous man, that she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him, and he revealed her life of life. she was astonishing and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is out of my breasts such a young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne on her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her home, as he had made Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatismus is not only unmoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we went to the mosque or stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We loved it and for us it was not a light decision, because the America had said to bring to our children: one that would check us through fear, or one, in which we can do our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">In our child's seat, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes, went into prayer, and what I saw, let me hold me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restlos.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam was a announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack ourselves, but to us.</seg>
<seg id="387">I have broken up in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion of compassion and demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will choose from the moment of fear and fanatics?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number one?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or if you are using, my: we are better than those who are using.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I ask me what do you say that you may claim that you are a TEDTalk, a memer with deep ages, work in a nobleach factory, so an exception and the rule did not rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, I don't know. I am quite normal. I am quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I have no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I'm so usually, as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims on all over the world, and I did that, with the largest ever recorded study on Muslims in the whole world, people want to normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">You want to live prosperity for the family, they want to work and want them live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am no exception in any sense.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to appear, then the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: many thanks. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, there stands shortly before, a commercial store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package deal in our social awareness, a autonomous fleet of flight machines in the Frac Centre in France live up a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with Selling.</seg>
<seg id="410">By setting up air motors, high speed and acceleration reached in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to convert turmoil and react to the nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the boundaries of the possibility in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to work an autonomous, it must know it to know it to know where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory in the ETH Zurich, we use only external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic effect.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aviation engine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands will be at highest levels of Ebene. g." "" "and" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit, which tries to beat two fenders with a folding device.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starristigler, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all of their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Contrary to most tip, it may be Swedish, so it has a large benefits of start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a cure.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear rigid is that they react sensitively to turmotions such as wind böen.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't be able to restore the optimum position, and the performance can be improved through exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we are often basic abstract issues related to the core of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the small number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a matter.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts, who prepares to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Ahead of decades, trained pilot-controlled flight machines were flying, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently, we discovered that Flies with only one work.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospan, the mechanically easier remote control. it was recently invented in short.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folding, Scharniere and Querruder, no other counters or contestloons, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens to fly very much, so it can be stable and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear of the rear. to get there, I must throw it exactly correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability, it's exactly right when I go all, it is low, that's why I will show you a video, which was filmed in night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospan exercise in Genügsamess is this machine to be used here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, a exercise in excess flow.</seg>
<seg id="443">Do do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is not only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, he is an ambience in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby, he will receive the opportunity to be a big ability.</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, no matter in which direction it is shot or even as he is roasted.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are in different models, the rest is met directly at the Flies.</seg>
<seg id="450">See us this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against watch-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you repairing them, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, it is going to go wrong with a motor or propeller, the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine even if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that we have to demonstrate a half of flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was a synthetic chill.</seg>
<seg id="459">The major number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and outfit it with localized technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit is white, where it is in space and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you want to make this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine da and I would like to be a fliezer out of the Lampenumbrella.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and the Schaffhausen.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, like wonderful and enchanting, our universe is, and that there are creative, clustering images allow them to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive professional and economic potential, is the Tüzelchen on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Some 1.3 billion years ago, galaxy in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are always faster, you get the mass of three probes in a tensile certificate in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">At this short moment they lit brighter than any stars in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">They put their energy, but not in the form of light free --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time feelings and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We're talking about the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago was a multi cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has experienced much more: corals, fish, plants, Saurians, people and -- God let us see us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, Rai Weiss decided to build a group of particularly aggressive -- Rai Weiss in the MIT, kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- a huge laser detectors to search for gravitation waves, which arise about collidiating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most visited it for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people called them as crazy Genies, so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of absence, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometric-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO increased significantly to increase performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 LIGO was launched for a last test run by some smaller, tough problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, some days after the commissioning of the Detector, the gravitation waves of the two collids black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the Detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">My daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the Abschied was ill out of my new father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruit of my life plant.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this which I had worked, is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has studied Gravitational shafts for 23 years and their observatories, such as LIGO measurement signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is one of herbs in the feelings of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When preluding the shaft, the room and its entire content will be embossed in one direction, and in the other gested content.</seg>
<seg id="495">For deterioration, doily in courses for remodeling theory often can be a right-related dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">While "dew and reservoir, dew and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, everybody was deposed by us at the end of the waves and striving the expansion of an average people at 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after Comma, followed by a 1. therefore, we declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's absurd, it would have to be measured in less than a thousandths of the radius of an atomic probe. this grotesque grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical Texan on Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, which are hunting after the waves: "the technical problems at construction of such detectors are raped.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finalist, and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO would be more than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for example, you can manufacture a picture or a map of things to get around the light of several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">At potash is the different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Sounds sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is very hard to make it impossible to make a picture of things to produce a lot of things:</seg>
<seg id="512">Around the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we hear about certain features such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice" now speaks Alice. "</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "she breaks her." ""</seg>
<seg id="516">Number Bob. "</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies for gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't manufacture these simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by writing to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, LIGO are the measured frequencies for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns in Schall, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">We would like to listen to the gravitation, about a lot about the collision of two black holes, making my colleague Scott already very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two body very quickly, you hear the same circues with an additional sound change. it sounds like to: Wu-wu-wu-wu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion distribution, expressed into the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015, a date that, at least I heard LIGO following: [Surrender of the device] Jemand, who knows what it must be heard of -- SH... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which makes about as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us, which means that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the closest body in all, one with a mass of 29 probe, the other with a mass of 36 sonds, surrounded by a hundred times a second, before they are collired.</seg>
<seg id="529">These forces are in front of these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">The stable importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet has a completely new way to exploring the exploration of the Alls, as they were never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all the all-known and the unvisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why they explores the stars in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical-outputs, however, are hidden in the core, which lies behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We never shall see, since this opak are never seen.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation-permeates iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it as the Urcrisp covers his own night-lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitation waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that all things exist in all things, which we never have never seen, that we have never seen, and of whom we have never seen, that we don't have to discover that we were able to discover.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found equal in the first step of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague to MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes as LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, old-old body from prehistoric times. the black holes are possible to say the Sauriers for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different angles of angles at all, to the emergence of the stars and finally, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be so brave like only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build a great detectors and the Rauschen and Circus of Cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories - a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the Urcrisy itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You are dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time, I was an experiment from the experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">A year I would say to all "Yes!" say, before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, me into unpleasant situations I zwang me, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live in television?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I cast my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a particular note that my life is deeply changed, on an unexpected Art. It began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the most beautiful, called for unexplained reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="570">If she would be a cellnered in the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"state," I needed milk for my snap. "" "</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once, when I could play with her, when I was straight on the jump. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swung me, always with them, as soon as you call me. no matter what I just do, or when I am, I say, I say Yes, each one time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I beatified me.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, to my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it has also an amazing tributors: just before short, I actually got entirely that the "Yes" Sagen to play my career with my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things from, raised to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I live TV. I live television. I have been broadcasted television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do not make television, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for this, 70 hours program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows, simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every programme offers hundreds of jobs that not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days in four shows, four TV programmes, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are in succession on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is globally globally, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasted, I have been created and not only produced, so even though I need to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans of bonfires to gather my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would like to print it all of them.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think when the word "Author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that you have a company, a country or a classroom, take you to understand that I'm not only about computer and imaginable, and it's true when I say, I understand that there is a dream job at a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all of a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I noticed to the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work is always a country from the Nichts.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I founded the troops, I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a portrait you have a high sound, and run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that is at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work. I love it.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is tripod, mechanical, exhausting, and worsening, funny and maternal, funny and maternal, cruel and reasonable, cruel and reasonable, and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There are so a change in me when the work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A swmen begins in my head, and it grows and growing, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could always travel to her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take up, if I heard them the sums of the sums, that I know that the writing is good.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that is doing.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began with the TV production began when I began to work and collaborating, build up, to create and work, I discovered this thing that sums up this sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums up is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have so a sums, you can't do differently than after the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not differently can be used, as far as size, regardless, for which price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This calls the sums up.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe, there is also a workolic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not going for the failure, and I know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I want to tell you, I am a titanium, and I know that I will not want to put it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear thing: the successful I'll be able to find more broadcasts, the more epic borders, the more work there is, the more things, the more things, the more things, the more or more. I love story, the more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">Ever more I work out, in order to be successful, the more must work myself.</seg>
<seg id="634">What I said to work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I cast, the marathon, which I drive up, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums of the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only do this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stop the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overlooks, overcloves, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters to the truth is accustomed to the truth that their mum is one of the only labour market.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write from my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "export, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums up.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I love my job not anymore. the engine was out of.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums was not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, carried out weekends, no Reuben, no Reuben, not delays, but don't know, with all the hearts, clear eyes, whatever always.</seg>
<seg id="654">There was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">I was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-display,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what does one does, if that is doing, the work that is love, suddenly fading?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some games think: "grl you from, daöder author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know how to be doing a teacher, a mother who loves to be a painter, Bill Gates, one who loves the sums of the sums, and know how to the sums of the sums up, if you know the sums up, if the sums stop, who is one?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What I am?</seg>
<seg id="669">I still have a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart sounds, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern states" in a question. "</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way to the outside, late and she says: "Mama is magst you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say, saying, No two things shall be aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First of all, I need to say Yes, and secondly, they called me. "</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls anymore "press". "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is what happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I am titanium and my sums up, and here changes all my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says: "mum, magst you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing is very special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters here, we are much and I read quite dramatic out of the book "Everybody Poops" from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the case of the sums, I can do nothing to fit apart.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quietly quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I cast, the marathon, the marathon, the army, the army, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists there are sticky fingers and a feudrank, delicate, juniper, and the song, in which it gets fun, or whatever the girl in "The Iron-gin '.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere, peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so that I can hardly breathe deeply.</seg>
<seg id="690">I hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">It dissolves something in me.</seg>
<seg id="694">An mentale door goes to and an energy boost comes.</seg>
<seg id="695">It is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel a magic mystery, I would like to know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">Let us remain in the case.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. no secret.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums of the workers, the work of titanium, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I query, if I tell you, who I am, if I am going to refer to the programs and television hours and how do my brain is, I don't forget what the real sums up.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no power and it is not working specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The genuine sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums of the sums is the power that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The genuine sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignored the pressure of history, which is to do dipping tasks, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The genuine sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but maybe that God gave me the wrong words, because the God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my kid wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am the fixed rule, so I can liberate me as a workolic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is Law, I don't have any choice. I don't have any choice if I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">Wish, it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Play me not ansatable as working as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is true,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, for I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to stay at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession would be painful, for what a man works better than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly honestly honestly Me myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too high, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, before and back, and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We will sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed Seifenblender.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel predominantly stif, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always get after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is O.K.</seg>
<seg id="738">My sons will show me how to know, and the sums of the universe met me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I'm playing and games until I ask me: why do we have one of the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let's always say Yes, if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naiv, for a day.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are quite right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child takes you less interesting when you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they are einfalls something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, you will be replaced by Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teenager daughter has 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes on the piece, even at a Schlemm-attitude!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no lingerie.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinners, the children's finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are not possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my chariots, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel that sums up to feel a place for peace and peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It doesn't go about games with their own children. it is joy to joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">You can enjoy the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I am happy and I won victories. friends meet, books, day and enjoy the day.</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "you're playing for everything that I was abandoned, when I got my first TV show when I was a titanium in the training when I wanted to ask myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why did not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums of the sums was back in my leisure time. the sums seem to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens. I listen to me in my office. I listen to me in my office. I listen to me with new ideas. I have put me into new ideas. I get back to new ideas. I besze it in full moves and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it not.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums of the sums, the sums is not... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me, but only a part. and therefore I am grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me to me that I am a titanium. I never saw a titanium, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes too much work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">But I still have everything in the handle. my brain is still functional. my brain is still working.</seg>
<seg id="781">Ever I'm playing, the happy, I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ever more I'm playing, the more feel I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">Ever I'm playing, the clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">Ever I'm playing, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I'm playing, the more I listen to the sums. the country, which I walk, the marathon, the troops, the swamp, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the swmen, the sums of life: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more making this unusual, beaked, naked and new life-feeling in me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">Ever more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things that I raised up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">The dream job should be a bit noumerical.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too much work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titles have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human load of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy impact or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organic, has a very low power to self-theirs.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a stable, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly it is one of the most famous, the "Tiefenhirsch". this implanting is an electrode deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of neons so that the neurological function improves the neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is actually an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered serious quotes and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">In Neuromodulation, however, does not use Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">We went to this dream come true.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close near.</seg>
<seg id="810">With a little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was the managing director and worked day and night at noting.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often used patients with skull-Hirn-Trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-miln traumata, the brain anschwillite and the skulant pressure will be inclined.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save the life, you must reduce the skulant pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Therefore, you must remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">That's no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Cells of a tissue piece is to grow, comparable with quite small children, that are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You must find the correct nutrition, temperature, moisture and environments to blossom the environments.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to make this cells with this cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">By many attempts, Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">It looked at his microscope under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as such as a regular cell culture. with great green cells, surrounded by small, unaffected cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you don't know from the biologico lessons that stem cells are inable cells that can turn into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has a stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprisingly, this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain tissue in surgery are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="832">We had another fascinating observation: normal tribal cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They die never, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But this cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They distributed slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that saw the stem cells, but looked otherwise stated.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from this cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">This blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have all in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandcerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play an important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus the fetus can provide for the feeding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">Why they will receive us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher levels near brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that's not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source, the brain is possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-speaking area and then the cells just as strong as it did Jean François-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently blacks that in the brain, in order to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we have seen them at the removal of the same individuum.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotrangrat.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions: what happens when we pass these cells into normal brain tissue tissue reimplessary? and what will happen when we reimplanted the same cells into a cerebral brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we observed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been given back after several weeks, they were back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we were able to injury an injury and reimplanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew by neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, these are these little points. these are the cells that we were color in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We were of course not heard of course.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help this cells also to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So trailed monkeys with a manual test task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable performance level, the last we achieved in the motor Cortex in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were flown, they were not able to move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just like it would happen in people, they recovering spontaneously until a certain degree, just as according to a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are sewn and then try them with the help of plastic mechanisms. they can recover at a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of the spontaneous recovery, implanted we had its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side, see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">He can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance by the violation of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you now see when we were reimplanted the cells: the same Affe, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you, that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathy models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still forever, but in people to implanting people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives you to healing himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Fr. Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I am sure - several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely have any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical studies at the people.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill up two kilograms of papers and forms to run these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG said: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years will come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then, one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select the treatment courses, and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one must apply to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must really believe that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you're told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a great mistake to consider it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see the democracy not as the fragile plant, which is in reality but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unaltered ground.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism are inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">It is true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy at us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it became clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- will not affect the austerity programs, which have been realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my mind that democracy would be abolished, if they would like anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">In order to believe me with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a trusive and defense democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are mixed, our future nozzle and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">For the subject: I would like to talk to an interesting country, which currently being threatened by our economic activity.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I am the" Twin "Paradox-Paradox." ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known for you. they know it and recognize him as the Debberg, who gives its long shadow over the USA, Europe, and all the world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Debberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few acknowledge his "s" s. "" "</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of wasted cash that are, however, are to invest there, however, to invest more productive and income, with whom you could wear the debt, and even all the things could produce mankind, for example, the green "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I have two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, to invest 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars, such as industry facilities, machines, office building, schools, roads, wind-quiet, equipment, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">A $3,4 trillion U.S. dollar spent a lot of money down to it's $5.1 trillion in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time and all financial institutions around the same time, except the stock markets and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital, the twin summit, which are not out of the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the US, Japan and Europe, who could not invest low demand in which they could not invest it. just like stoves's father, who could kill him that his son would kill him when he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">The circumstances leads to the circumstances that lead him kittled him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haders with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely productive capital should be employed by all the inproductive capital should be used to improve our lives and develop particularly all the technologies to finance, "green" technologies that are decisive for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So, democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think we think. but before we continue: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form and control the poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athic democracy closed course to many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would be a mistake to get the job value of the athic democracy due to these remedies.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision at the athic democracy which was, and it is not only the right to free use of freedom, but even more important and decision that they had the right to political tensioner with the same vocal weighting in questions of state aid.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy hasn't been held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a notch, which is very bright, it is also fast growing.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens.</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the U.S. Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, who ultimately became a set for prevailing.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy came only to, when a complete separation of politics and the economy is possible, and the democratic process was placed on the policy, while the economy - the world of concert -- a democratic zone has been added.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time, in which the separation of politics and the economy began, an immigrant struggle between the two companies by the economy and to emigrate the politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians did not have more so like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It lies not on an degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is in fact that in the government it can be in the government and nevertheless not on power because the power of the policy is divided into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Haders with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of smoking, which so on the animals, of which they are nourished, they proclaimed that they will be hungry by the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that brought politics as far as the self-caused economic crisis. the power of the companies grows, imbalances, macroeconomic demand, and the managing director of the corporations are to be frightened by cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">One of the successful capitalism in capitalism "Demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour force and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy would be better, if the "Demos" control is retains, like in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist Left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't go sonly well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor kill themselves through a miracle, like in the ancient Athens, without a new species of brutality and disappearance.</seg>
<seg id="953">There is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by using Niedribell and replaced by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that for a long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin people will be deeper than the waste of the waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it will be very soon as I believe in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to join the economy and the economy and politics again, and in order to make sure that we can be re-established in an disease hyperautocracker, which lets the film "matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So, the question is not whether the capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he will survive;</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is to be similar to capitalism by a Dystroscopy, in which the society has used to serve people into the exploration of life, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athos "Agora," in long discussions with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we are allowed to be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would like to look like this "Star Trek" like the utopia instead of the "Matrix" like similar Dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples in the practical implementation.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: imagine a capital market, where you can see money, while you are working in one of the next capital, by a company to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one has just been working -- is the ownership of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital, and redeem, and the concept of the wage work is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but the company does not work there, and employees that the company does not belong to the capital. no tauter will be between investment and labour, no great gaps between investment and savings, and finally no emporractive summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have free fluctuated exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], will be issued in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency, -- we will call them "Cosmos," in units of "Kosmos," -- and any government paid the sum that meets the trade deficit or the trade balance of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment resources are razed.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed a conference in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one could not implement the technical funds then at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have, especially in particular in the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I enter you at the same time, is the same time, in which the separation of capital and labour will be buried in the garbage collection of history, and keynesize as well as keynesize.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can introduce ourselves a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or we will drop in a "matrix" - similar Dystroscopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You'll find yourself in your biography itself as liberating Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and business is... Tun we don't know the technological development will generate a massive decline in all-economic demand that Larry Sumatra's "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of these crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only need our democratic destabilise, but also the countries whose interest has been low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant to be relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Likewise as Hayek, I am a liberal Marxist living and, like Keynes, and therefore I am a perfect wirr.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are also there too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't have a wirr, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG said: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who told Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have to keep it very clear what you keep from the perspective of the West.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large degree of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the call of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we said the democracy to the policy, while the area is playing, -- the area of the economy - a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense if I can say that this is a provoking, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- we remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism and democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, which affects the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can watch out in China, resembles the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now come to do so what the West in the 19th century itself has done raving to Heuchelei.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as financial minister of Greece from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that the coming comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG said: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How to look six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing, for we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, by the self-fake to adopt, and the lasting verdicts that a massive decline was threatened by the Eurozone, and continue to rise to the development of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek continent -- the way, the first suggestion was revealed, who has revealed these veranding.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the boys within the euro zone, in the eurozone, continues to continue the merits of the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one is trying to get an economic system, which is not superior to receive by political will and authorization on the life, you may have any time a while, but if the change comes, it happens abrupt and destroyable.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what To you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we did not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have made any mistakes in your time as financial minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG said to the example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvest.</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is an Minister for Finance, or any minister, which, after 6 months in office, is, in a so-called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it's not a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made error.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistakes was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a huge interest on pages of money, a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that gave it.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They wanted to bring to the case only our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the plans to run by the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't know that they have passed a catastrophic program for 5 years since 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominous GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika of money, which has imposed us these policy, confessed that: "this was a colossaler error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive type of talks, they seem to be quite per-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">It is my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, from Yemen, who lives in Europe and loves to love.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone is not survived.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the demonstraighties were demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This is not alone for Europe's catastrophic episodes, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we have taken the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be less expensive for the future of Europeans, as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope to be wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, many thanks, that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of Roy Price have never heard most even though he is responsible for 22 medium-term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy ago three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is the executive positions at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has a Iyellowur and describes himself on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for this shows, shows the shows and the content of the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can not select any any time.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows shows that there are quite right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating will show from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will receive your show with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">They are shows as "Breaking bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addictive, where you have one night, your brain tells: "where there is more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This type of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows shows as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should be enough to say that at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not respond to the right side of the curve on the left side of the curve, because I don't need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It's more thoughts about the mean outage, the average television -- the shows which are neither good even bad, they don't miss it.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course there is also the first time that Amazon is so something that Amazon is nothing to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a competition, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produced the first episode of each of these shows and represents them online where they can see every free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free to make things that you do, correct?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of people look forward to this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they should be observed with the check in this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed in Roy and his team, who won everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show, when you are at, that parts you turn, or again at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process, and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a seat of four republican US Senate."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7,5 -- is a little over the average, but not just what is Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time in another company there is a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy's searching for a super-show and it also uses data, but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of a competition, he and his team will present the existing data via the Netflix audience, so on reviews they give the shows, which shows the shows, which shows you like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then, they use this data to find this small details about the viewer: what shows they like the producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they were together all the parts, they went up a car, and decided to make a seat of a seat on four channels, but a drama of a drama with a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" has a 9,1-rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it's great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">? Is what is what?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic states that it should work with everything should work.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, for a decision which you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindeste what you can expect, is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working, then this is a little frightening, because we live in a time, in which we live more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions about television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Knows someone here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come to touch in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in the USA in jail and in order to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like on Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, will be chosen whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mean television, 22 minutes, that can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. that's not remember that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes it sometimes error.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it can say through data analysis of the flu, the limiting species, predictions -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It was wonderful and was a great news channel. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It works fine, year to year, until it suddenly didn't work properly,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was simply not simply that this was again a sensation, including the Resistance of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is sealed, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these mistakes the data regarding decisions in the decisions of life - -- at the workplace, in the study of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I'm working in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very clever people are unacceptable for a lot of data to make serious decisions such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years, I realized some pattern on the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you need to solve a complex problem, do you do most of two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you can analyse this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, put the individual parts back together to touch a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do it several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to put a problem with and understand his parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">You are not suitable to put the parts back again, and then to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is a different tool and we have all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If something is something, in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is not complete, in order to touch a good order - especially if it is the brain of a experts.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they have not used it and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can use data to understand their audience, for which they were not able to do so. but the decision to put all these parts, put together and have a show as "House of Cards," that stood not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">On the way, in contrast, this was the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they were voted for TV's ideas as they voted "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because she could always say: "tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I think things will be wrong when data started to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and not forget to forget this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">You will find many of you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this tool was to make the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also known as Magic 8 Ball, "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question, you have to shake just the ball to get a reply." highly likely "-- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll see it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So I've arrived some decisions in my life, but I would have heard on the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace these by something much more sophisticated, as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this is changed the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball goes and sophisticated and the peaks. eventually, it's enough to meet decisions, if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data, there is to be paid to make decisions that is to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end there are not the data, but the risks involved in which you will land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
