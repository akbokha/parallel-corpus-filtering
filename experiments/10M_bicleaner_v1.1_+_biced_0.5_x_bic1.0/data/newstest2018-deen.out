Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that modify your view of the city .
an ir@@ res institutions , where you@@ ths are supposed to address the youth today .
a pits - where is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner be@@ es the unanim@@ ous reason of farmers .
the oldest official map Mün@@ ze promotes exciting stories .
it is nervous , if maps are not currently available .
that knows everyone who had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i was held instead of a green me@@ adow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria , is the state government &apos;s national government , all other than currently - yet very excited .
especially if you compar@@ es it with current online cards .
then , how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ep@@ ho@@ e , which is not equal as such as such .
in the big overview map were mentioned for cities and municipalities in detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ als . &quot;
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Trial Management between 1810 and 1864 and published the first surve@@ ying of Bay@@ erns Bay@@ erns .
their client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns of course - of course to military purposes .
after the French troops made peace with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 : there were today &apos;s neighbours , which created the idea of a surface @-@ wide Bayern map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and the Bay@@ erische Trial Management founded .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation sheet of Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 , and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / Ton@@ ight is on the example of the state capital of the most impressive .
the city has grown into all directions and has grown rapidly .
one example of this is under@@ s@@ end@@ ling , which is relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after creating the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses focus on 18@@ 56 along the present day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can &apos;t see nothing as fields - at the first sight : when using the hin@@ ge , a small @-@ part map with d@@ ered lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ um@@ ption , &quot; which was derived from the base tax .
small plots prove there any more farmers today - but small g@@ är@@ man of the plant &quot; Land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Theresi@@ enstadt , which was the site of the October century , in fact , was actually a me@@ adow and a me@@ adow .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names , &quot; on the Gast@@ eig , &quot; or from the height &quot; At the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; ir@@ res institutions . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße to be locked here with W@@ ahn@@ vor@@ tions here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße .
there was 1858 / 59 , the Munich @-@ Irish institution &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ beck . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden , led the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist , who is brought to the death of King Ludwi@@ gs .
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended , for example , the anchor chains of the so @-@ called ir@@ ren .
in addition , he says the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institutions .
for 280 patients , first place was first , later was expanded to 500 seats .
sometime even this capacity was not more - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ sis plant in hair 1905 .
there have been there since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist en Germany .
there are young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the area of the former Au@@ er institutions .
the Order was acquired in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training establishments .
located to the west , the soccer field of TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of dormit@@ ories from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural connection to the origin of the Ir@@ render Institute , who had been destroyed during the Second World War during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was recorded in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought by the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies , in December 1944 many holes in the city centre .
a great remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pits in the Middle Ages once stood on the Mari@@ enhof , where this days is planned and will take place on 5 April 2017 in the breaking Cer@@ em@@ ony for the second S @-@ Bahn .
the old Munich @-@ map can compare the old Munich @-@ map with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ enhof process .
Civil Rights published published in Mis@@ souri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to discre@@ et policy and racial attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board of the State of Mis@@ souri , which will take into force up to 28 August 2017 , will leave special attention through the state of particular attention to the state , as a set of frag@@ worthy , r@@ int @-@ based accidents in the overall state , and here , &quot; it is said in the opinion of the group .
a recent law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people he@@ avier to win discrimination , as well as the law en@@ forcement agencies of the state , which are un@@ acceptable to minorities , the group said the NA@@ AC@@ P , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; you have violations of the civil rights to happen people .
they will be defeated because of their skin , they are assembled or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard it . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the United States .
the group followed inci@@ dents like racial crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year , after he had no longer removed from the state by the State of Mis@@ souri , and from the police of Mis@@ souri , was accused of having accused of having a crime .
the Council also indicates a recently published report by the Office of the General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ old of Mis@@ souri , in which black driver he will be more likely to be more frequently in the state 75 percent more frequently .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees inform about what could happen in Mis@@ souri might &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the people must be ready to bring whether the money @-@ money or the relatives know that they are travelling by the state . &quot;
Mis@@ souri posted 100 Hass@@ elt , according to the latest numbers from the FBI , who att@@ acking the state in terms of the amount of such injuries on the 16 . rank of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri Law that would be harder to keep a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had adopted the local criminal prosecution authorities , to commit people because of confidence , people because of confidence , which is due to the view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warning are generally issued by the State Department for other countries , but in the last time , stakeholders have been used as reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA .
Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ Project is elem@@ ental
the Fisch@@ erb@@ acher Wei@@ de@@ cel@@ n project is a successful project and is continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac took place on site a picture .
at the jus@@ tification of the Schwen@@ demann family met the representatives of the fish erb@@ acher CD@@ U region and together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two ME@@ Ps .
Markus Schwen@@ demann was initially offering insights into his operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and many young animals and in five apartments are accommod@@ ated .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; is designed for him of the alternative @-@ market path for the milk of its cows , such as til@@ demann .
the facility is based exclusively for regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ chairman of Fish@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ o Project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t find it to so steep surfaces .
the green area of space for a lot of work , much need to be processed using the engine sense .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann .
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ uted operation and put these without any chemical plant protection and ferti@@ li@@ zer , even if he has no bio @-@ operation .
for mayor , Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ ts and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
you hope so , so that the fact that the surfaces could be moved even a whole while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and have thought about how they will bring its operations , &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor .
farmers still stand because of the promotion of work often in criticism
in 2013 , the Wei@@ de@@ z@@ aun@@ dice promotion were fenced in 2013 , 25 plots of eleven participants .
the open maintenance area amounts to 40 hectares , which can not be used until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leader was funded by the leader , the municipality of Fish@@ bach .
thus , the farmers still have to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the Z@@ ä@@ une , &quot; explained Schwen@@ demann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you make a really good job , without farmers and land women . &quot;
also for Peter White was fixed : &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot;
the State Court ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will allow the state support of Wei@@ de@@ zä@@ unen .
objective is the open maintenance of the Black Forest .
condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR @-@ drawn feed .
moreover , the un@@ avoid@@ able area should not be false . ( hang@@ ers over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
to make the request of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build eight participants with 24 pitches .
the open maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the lower cost is more than 112 billion euros .
is nothing holy ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is the Statue of Liberty to make the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of an regime pack it is , if they start to attack the statues .
Americans know these equally as any other - therefore the sor@@ row at the fall of Saddam Hussein was at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key idea of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did he did when he did a symbolic Ax@@ t in a hit@@ ch with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN over the suggestions of the president for dr@@ astic cuts to the Statue of Liberty with the Statue of Liberty .
in order to remain fair , Miller attacked not the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat cap@@ ers and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators have made him that when he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and especially the importance of their significance was attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an icon of American freedom which sh@@ out the world .
the poem , which you refer to what was added later , was not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is over@@ crowded , but as he stated it , it does not really feel the story .
it is going to have the contemporary Reson@@ ance on the moving words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the nu@@ sts of the poor : &quot; your poor , your arms , your arms masses that would be free to breathe deeply , in@@ hale , and the waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ende &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller eng@@ ined not in literary criticism - it made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of a statue of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict to the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends , who made sure to place their words in her death on the basis - did you know that they had a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Repub@@ lic@@ ism by calling it in an ab@@ used classical picture of the female Em@@ bodied Communication .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem , the female figure is not more abstract - she has got a voice .
and she gives themselves another name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant Fem@@ ale Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and precisely how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change the people from the right wing .
the great write @-@ like Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bapti@@ st , argued that the Statue of Liberty &apos;s Liberty , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , who able to bring the American flame into the um@@ ped world : &quot; Lady Liberty is prog@@ ressing rapidly .
it is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ el is not to get the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here at a little bit .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of perception of perception .
the great fantastic asi@@ ev@@ olle indeed from Lazarus existed in this way , as they saw from the exhaus@@ tive , but hoped for long and often terrible trips to the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear .
and of course , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump is ever seen .
their f@@ ack@@ el is to un@@ fold the way to the way , but hatred , who is the only source of power in power .
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black , Scottish members of the UK
Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when only two circuits were included to the UK team .
the performance Director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the World Champion &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
Black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special , &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand it and we will continue to keep it on it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athlete , remember that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athlete are medals from medals , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ovo - the members of Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while the team was elected to team &apos;s team &apos;s team mate Do@@ yle .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ ie is quite modest .
her chapter @-@ speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were living or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that brought the Ei@@ li@@ ie very of course , were fantastic . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ silver me@@ da@@ zzling syndrome who will compete in their fifth world championship rounds at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it &apos;s &quot; incredibly &quot; is that 16 sh@@ aves are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runners Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
you will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shot looking for one of a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first world championships , when the only other shot in the Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was re@@ located .
the Man Chap@@ ter@@ in says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their land sle@@ ute not only belong to the team , but in some cases , even at the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special team ad@@ mits in the team , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate for me now and have chosen me , making it something very special for me , &quot; added it to me .
&quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all those who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came to .
and they are here as the established athlete , athletes , who want to rise to Po@@ e@@ dies .
what my speech made as chapter in concerns ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to set this home support , and we profit that we are back in the Olympiastadion are again .
I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it will simply be so great atmosphere there . &quot;
block from Kri@@ tik@@ ern on Facebook : be@@ wir@@ l you do not bear a public office if you don &apos;t bear the vot@@ ers from vot@@ ers .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it was not long until the newspapers were forced him , from the Domestic Policy and its political principles .
he ch@@ ased in criticism , safe .
he did not bear his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1783 , Washington said : &quot; the expression can be taken away ; and , stu@@ pid and silent , we are led like the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Ho@@ gan , who has to work out more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan employees have the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted the opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , this was the beginning of this week .
the founding of the Govern@@ ors of the governor , the law@@ suit filed as freezing , and the online commentary was full of any counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if there is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is no re@@ ac@@ tionary head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his vot@@ ers and play his ha@@ unting head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block of people who come to the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially called by employees that are paid by public tax dollar - un@@ necessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended the actions of the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing further than a present@@ ation .
but it &apos;s easy to use the picture of Tro@@ y or spo@@ ilt , or stu@@ p@@ itted people that are online to go out online .
the post spoke with some of the real men that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , entrepreneur , and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all told that their comments , resp@@ ects and not prof@@ iting .
the minister zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ass@@ met , but it was asked to Hass@@ elt to Hass@@ elt .
&quot; I commented that I dis@@ appointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ elt and other current messages , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the news series &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I guess this idea , even if a number of people came to the same topic , then they become more rather than a so @-@ called collective deployment and recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the members of the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack , &quot; other probably would probably be &quot; inter@@ vening language . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by using a critic or negative comment .
it &apos;s much more clean than in the last time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or demonstr@@ ators .
but this happens exactly what happened .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public officials that critic@@ ises the Facebook and other social media is imp@@ acted .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the president of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First A@@ men@@ d@@ ment , according to US District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she took a elect@@ orate of her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that should not be hard to be hard .
at the moment Washington had the time of affordable Por@@ tos a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers were presented to his lead between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and an anonymous correspondence writer .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who made pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters on newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions .
Peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the shipping with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that have been collected by the George Washington Project on the occasion of the historical documents .
but he has not brought it to the silence .
expression of freedom , oppos@@ ing views and courses are among the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ ert@@ y hopes to domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ ert@@ y will hope for the next three days in a domestic comfort because the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which took place in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is a member of the host location and functions as a tournament bot@@ t in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his fame , &quot; said Raff@@ ert@@ y .
the players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry has made a great job when he laid this site .
it is a fri@@ freeze of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is pleased to defend his championship for the first time although he won the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels very special , &quot; said that in South@@ port @-@ based players .
&quot; I have not defend the Extre@@ madura about it , since they had won them in the year after I had won them from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time , and one that we are always appreciated . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to his 50th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the ground on home .
this event will be his first Scottish performance at the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; if you want it good , but you don &apos;t have to make this additional print .
I really enjoyed playing back , and I have played a solid golf .
I am happy about how it is done . &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ally .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sc@@ ars on the field , the other are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all revenues go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ ls by Passi@@ v@@ eins
in the past two decades , less people are dying due to passi@@ v@@ rau@@ ry on lung cancer .
for this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ ppendorf ( UK@@ E ) will be found in one study .
&quot; according to our estimates , between 167 lung cancer wor@@ ding cases are attributed to passi@@ v@@ ot , &quot; said school manager Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he moved to this issue of 1994 .
at that time , 400 lung cancer have been given to Germany for passi@@ v@@ rau@@ ry per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house @-@ connections can be found as a very complex
the construction work at the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; reasonably reasonably priced at the time , &quot; says the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is complicated as suspected , since there is a lot of mountains , which is not in the plans .
the traffic , which is always preparing for the construction of construction , represents a large problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ign@@ or@@ anz of the drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red Amp@@ s and Ab@@ sper@@ r@@ g@@ it@@ ters are enorm@@ ously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked for dinner , use it not a stove .
they even use only rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai state in the province of Papua New Zealand , the house@@ wife is normally known as a swe@@ ets - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the lum@@ ber@@ ed child will be taken out and worn out .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where they can also make their daily work , such as clothes with clou@@ dy water from the near S@@ umpf .
a bu@@ cket serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of their husband , they were not assigned to their fields .
Poly@@ g@@ ami@@ e is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to be dangerous . most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one hit it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; says it .
it is a more rare insight into the living life in the high@@ lands of Papua New Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ der were able to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which led to independence for the Dutch rule , turned over to the government of Jakarta , which operates control of the region and foreign journalists or foreign journalists .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua New Guinea , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea was involved in the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so ab@@ orted like it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a mor@@ nings 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .

Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst nur@@ ture and alpha@@ be@@ ti@@ zing rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esians in Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has made gold and copper alone at a value of 3.1 billion dollars .
in addition , Papua above wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these rich@@ ness are , however , a source of the Elys@@ ée for Papua New Zealand , ensure that Indon@@ esians is powerful presence in the military .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units sold nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic claims according to major autonomy , these Golden G@@ ans had to be treated with this sc@@ ans .
according to the activists of activists , more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands of def@@ endants were ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal @-@ country in the 1970 @-@ 1970s were designated according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police killed more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
in a report from the year 2016 there is a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane International from 2016 , which are included in the report on the previous year , such as such as un@@ statutory exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
screws have been reinforced , because Pap@@ u@@ as Resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demographic development has changed , as Muslim immigrants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua - including P@@ ani@@ ai on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Papua New Zealand has changed little since , and today are involved in the locals .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have been in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will meet our hopes , &quot; says you .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is and its inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fires in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , two in@@ don@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the sof@@ tened children told them that they should switch their head@@ light .
one of the soldiers took place in her sound and was later led by four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had de@@ dr@@ unk , drove , and stroke the group with their def@@ ensive , said victims and witnesses .
then mo@@ ist of the soldiers into the group of children .
a child , who was 16 year old Yu@@ li@@ anus &apos;s Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into the Comintern .
a few hours later , the building was set to fire on the next day , and the things are en@@ ali@@ ated on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military commander of the military centre to request justice .
they disp@@ ers@@ ed Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in a circle continuously , and a bird @-@ song of Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago ( from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e ) .
some demonstr@@ ators started stones to police and military bases .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are more than three resist@@ or , shooting she is dead , &quot; it is in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not approved the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ star@@ els from En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , looked after peace and called for peace and demanded the amount of looking back home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned me , I was shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his b@@ unt painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows that Kay@@ ame knows yet , who knows , but says that the ball came from the numbers of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were called &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin who was witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I burnt down to him , and sought his body to be sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is like many Indon@@ esians , who carries a name of the TIM@@ E in the dunes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I saw him . &quot;
the Che@@ ese sp@@ ector of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said Rep@@ or@@ ters said that his officers would only wanted to be &quot; secure &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend us when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman of Papua police , commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
it is going to life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news on the kill@@ ings came only at the following day &apos;s fil@@ tered &apos; at Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i gave a passionate speech given to the presence of sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims of vo@@ iced and pregnant the historical situation in Papua New Zealand .
&quot; I would like to be solved that this case is immediately solved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he insi@@ sted an extra@@ judicial mechanism as a court of human rights ab@@ uses .
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred in front of a long time .
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to go through these verses , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto became a retreat when he spoke at the Jakarta in Jakarta with the TIM@@ E and said , he had no plans in Papua to establish a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything will be regulated by law . &quot;
Wir@@ anto , which the UN counts for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 fat@@ alities in East Tim@@ or , which had demanded that 11 cases of human rights violations brought in Papua New Zealand , including the P@@ ani@@ ai Vor@@ um .
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims are victims of alle@@ g@@ ations with fi@@ er@@ ce un@@ stu@@ ds .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military to become shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ am repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after I was buried the bodies , the military sought me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
did not belong to the shooting of shooting .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police on the vill@@ agers of the village of P@@ ei@@ y@@ ai neighborhood next to the village of D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a strange man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , which was dr@@ unk when he died in a near river fishing , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested against the company &apos;s location in front of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers of the vill@@ agers loaded on officers , which led to re@@ acted them a warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( in@@ don@@ ese paramilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot a lot of shooting and killed .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , close to hospital hospital and witness , as the last one has been quickly delivered here , the TIM@@ E says .
&quot; I &apos;ve got two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to move the participating officers to the Cal@@ cul@@ ation and the mobile Brigade of the police from the border .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ h@@ iron d for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , D@@ ani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua New Zealand .
many included the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua New to defend them with spor@@ adic attacks and removal of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leaders originate from P@@ ani@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to the years thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some cases never look back .
among the people in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai is known as &quot; a portable , &quot; forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is for locals too expensive .
bread is just beyond the range .
people build here everything , what they eat . above all emer@@ a and fruit and foli@@ age .
agriculture is the task of women who can view four or five fields of confection@@ ary bodies each .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ e@@ ys only 10,000 in@@ don@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
during the time , economic ine@@ ties are grown between the native Papua New Zealand and the new migrants , since the opening of new river gro@@ oves in the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region , go in rule to the better trained and wealthy of their migrants .
Papua have rarely the capital or the necessary capabilities to lead their own company .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... because there &apos;s no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of P@@ ani@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world from Papua .
moreover , restrictions on the reporting of the reporting is sc@@ anned .
in the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of insufficient coordination with related institutions from Papua New Zealand , although they were given the rare permission to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ per K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , cont@@ est@@ ations of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign to increase the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ calm east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua reports : visa checks and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , the six paci@@ fic states - T@@ onga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ ite islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; various and far more widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the P@@ ani@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have seen the OP@@ M supporting the same countries .
the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it &apos;s difficult to prevent the evidence for human rights issues . &quot;
people don &apos;t want to consider that more foreign governments can take this to the knowledge of more foreign governments .
when a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Rights , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura visited the 4th of May , they broke their silence and troubled him &quot; We would like freedom , &quot; according to a source who wants to participate in the meeting , but would be anonymous .
in Indonesia , 2019 has a further presidential election , but the Papua saying that they probably do not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved by the people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai templ@@ ates , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart the fact that it is under the permanent threat of a common military , is in arm@@ our education and health services .
Gob@@ ai said that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt , &quot; which he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they want only justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ers found a last symbolic act of peace : the bodies of a O@@ pf@@ one was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never forget righteousness , but at least , they don &apos;t forget to forget their crimes against humanity .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ter@@ with the head of our family .
&quot; what can we do so ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential doors in Dubai , hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is in only two years by the high @-@ rise , which is called Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word above the cause of flam@@ me .
&quot; we have sle@@ pt and we are standing in the Fire alarm and the write of the people .
we burnt down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor , to come , &quot; says a residents who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection agencies said that the units of the fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and the fire will be cooled down .
the government said they work on the provision of accommodations for the people .
the incident can ask questions for the safety of materials that are used in external areas around the world .
an investigation by the management of Tor@@ ch &apos;s building was found in 2015 , that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the external clothing for decoration or isolation .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system used for isolation and clothing at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire that could have been killed in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is made with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p near the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi Minh City , the competition was supported for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , only on two pay@@ sets , hau@@ l is not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but this is therefore very estimated five @-@ sentence in the tradition of the tradition .
6@@ 3.9 percent of the member states for the reform , the target of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , thus only slightly worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this decision , but are dis@@ appointed that our member nations did not have the entire Reformation package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ ian and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
you will continue to work with the application to improve the application .
not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies already before the proposal came on , the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be represented in the first round the host right in the first round .
to reduce costs for the organizers , the demands are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . and players will need to complete more official media release before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings forth objects into the plane , a survey found out .
a survey conducted under flight cards revealed that more than 20 percent un@@ conscious un@@ conscious items are over , including at least 6 per cent , including the aircraft rates , while they acci@@ dentally deleted or other items with Klin@@ gen .
less than 1 percent claimed they were later that they had been able to spend it with bul@@ lets , amm@@ unition , amm@@ unition or explosive materials .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet char@@ tered service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travelers have to use the rules for more than 1,000 people .
of those surve@@ yed that they did know that they have been banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 % Millennium Tar@@ get were compared to less than 15 percent , which were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that were ab@@ orted to T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent told to know items with Klin@@ gen by the security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents agreed , and 3.7 percent of the male respondents agreed that they were ab@@ orted to the plane in the airplane .
the company said , I asked travelers throughout the country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally put the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware due to the airport security and how many of it was clearly seen .
it is no surprise that people who carry the most common s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - knowledge and ignor@@ ance - through the safety , those who were most commonly flying .
the company shows however , however , that the T@@ SA directive is a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain , what liquids they are allowed or how much of it .
so , it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of objects used by T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated fluids .
for a time , the people who could see T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla .
electro @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy with the huge number of arrangements for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has so far hit that a part of the customer has with@@ drawn their un@@ binding reservation back .
in addition to the always favorable figures , Tesla leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has increased sales for the first time in the announcement of recent quarterly figures for the first time , while the canc@@ ell@@ ations made the canc@@ ell@@ ations at the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had frequently used more than 500,000 arrangements for the new car , whose delivery begins .
now , Mus@@ k is now : of the total of 5@@ 18.000 orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been with@@ drawn again .
critics had always pointed out again , that it is only a binding reservations .
in a canc@@ ell@@ ations of Tesla has paid 1000 euros ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in Britain 1000 pounds ) .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ binding reservations before , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference .
so that the canc@@ ell@@ ations of previously could be around twelve percent of all orders for the problem , however , Tesla was not believed to have Tesla .
his argument is : the challenge with ambitious growth destinations is not in demand , but on the production page .
last year , Tesla had supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 , 2018 , all models have taken place - 500,000 , by 2020 a million .
demand is obviously because .
according to Mus@@ k , currently , 1800 reservations currently occur per day .
who is now ordered a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; the earliest in the second half of 2018 on delivery - if Tesla it creates , its brand @-@ new , never even tested in practice tested production roads without greater interrup@@ tions .
many experts will have two experts that this is possible .
however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the un@@ binding of the reservations may be used for Tesla .
because then , the company is not satisfied with their satisfied customers , in a shame .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves to reduce emissions of the Obama administration on reducing emissions due to the hin@@ ge of the Obama administration
a day after having participated from 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change to meet the requirements of the governmental environmental authorities , compared to the previous administration .
he mentioned the law@@ suit , which had been filed against his previous site in a Federal Constitutional Court .
it &apos;s about a deadline which ran on 1 October for the states that hold the standards from 2015 for ground floor o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he had to go to a year in order to make his authority to study more time to study the plan , and to avoid the economic decisions in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosecutor from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of reliable opponent .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has gone repeatedly to block regul@@ ating or delayed , or delayed by the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden return from Wednesday is the youngest legal restra@@ int for the P@@ ru@@ e check back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court decided that the EPA group had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks , to be delayed .
in one on Wednesday night statement , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende in o@@ zone standards just put the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of premature ejaculation .
under previous administra@@ tions , the EPA often did not hold the Fri@@ sts for the implementation , and then , in an agreement reached the appointment for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t believe in regulation with jurisdiction , and we take Fri@@ ed seriously .
we also take the law and authority , who gives us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA is that P@@ ru@@ itt point out his &quot; powers to delay and all other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations will be based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress went to a more comprehensive novel@@ ist of the o@@ zone of o@@ zone .
a draft bill was approved for the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet closed in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Eric C@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the states that had compl@@ ains the EPA in this week , said the group intended to get the statutory health .
&quot; the return of EPA - according to our cl@@ ashes - is an important profit to health and safety of these 7 million New York and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; said An@@ der@@ man .
in this case , in this case of California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Foreign Affairs , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone has been created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere at sunlight .
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of serious problems , and every year contribute to thousands of premature fat@@ alities .
representatives of public health and environmental cont@@ actors gathered over P@@ ru@@ sters the course of course .
&quot; it is wor@@ rying , as much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the developers responsible for the protection of the air that we receive in@@ hale , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Divers@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ideological cruise of the Tr@@ uman &apos;s government , to environmental protection and their particular interests . &quot;

the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was formed from the early medieval self @-@ law .

the roof was invisible .
in 1796 , French troops are near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit , and church chairs and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the Church had to overthrow in 1809 .

let &apos;s go from 15.@@ 30 .
for the k@@ lang of the Ser@@ en@@ ade will take place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the promot@@ ers are the fantastic view .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers aim for many supporters to the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tumours and listeners .
the friends and promotion of Tum@@ es are particularly obliged to have committed themselves , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organi@@ zer Walter Martini .
the Club wants to check the permission from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s .
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; no legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned over to the Land@@ rat .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) is asked to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines at the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette .
it is illegal to be illegal .
the association argued that at the time of the Trial on 30 December 2016 at Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette even no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time at the town limit of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are still possible in the same time , the concentration zone , but the concentration zone , for the rest of the city area .
zones zones should prevent a &quot; fail@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by an amend@@ ment to the Flemish clubteam settlement in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette - but the District government were not approved by the District Government in Düsseldorf .
&quot; by the lack of legal assessment , the approval for itself had to be illegal and hence also return , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of things : the city council agreed again from the summer break before the summer break again in the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette . a approval of the District government still stands out .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; this is the acquisition of a approval for the establishment of wind energy systems planned agreement . &quot;
the district confirms the entrance to the request .
&quot; the appropriate letter has passed since last week to the circle of four , &quot; explained a speaker .
as a result , it takes place again to check the matter .
it is likely not to do that the procedure will be stopped .
as a result of the ongoing procedure in the administrative court , the circle wanted to move on Thursday to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , is planning to build four of 200 meters high wind speeds on the site of the Bo@@ ish@@ eim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company had already been involved in the city of four @-@ sized companies , P@@ acht@@ ner agreements with the owners of about 65 hectares .
with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the electricity needs to be covered by approximately 11 400 households , which equ@@ ates about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four thousand households .
the NE@@ W Re will invest some 20 million euros .
in the summer of summer , Vi@@ ers@@ ens Stad@@ entered green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich in Aachen and a participation in the wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg .

the action under the suspension of the I@@ HK and with many partners do not make sure that every citizen could be able to affect his direct environment itself .

Moo@@ res Ford @-@ massacres : activists lead rass@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ unk down to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which could reach the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach a group of white male out to block his way .
the leader of the M@@ ob - a man middle @-@ ages in a con@@ cre@@ ase - took a long train at his cig@@ ar , and looking for the wind@@ screen .
dr@@ unk inside the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; for the man .
&quot; H@@ ol him from the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie cr@@ ush the silence , when a young black man was sh@@ attered by the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , only a rep@@ lica .
but if a sn@@ are thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; to the neck , almost all in the audience very real S@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
since 2005 , civil rights will return to Moore &apos;s &apos; Ford Bridge , a two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , and George and Mae Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has been indicted because of the murder .
it is really true that in all these years , although we were not able to see them in our communities , although we know what they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks which helps with the organisation &apos;s organization .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a load for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year old former congress the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the claim is a dramatic call for him and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an accident has never been correc@@ ted .
&quot; we want to en@@ forcement , we want the termin@@ ation , we want to say , we want to reconciliation , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation we will receive righteousness . &quot;
a judicial medi@@ cally set up a bed linen on the bodies of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to the FBI Ak@@ ten , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding communities were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none of them was charged .
although the susp@@ ects has been on free foot to remain un@@ lawful for decades that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was still known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision was made by the Supreme Court of Justice for the first time in Georgia to give their voice to their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election of the FBI , according to the FBI , according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ kind H@@ ester , while a struggle , supposedly on a woman .
bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or of the city was , that H@@ ester with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y sle@@ pt and that the baby , which she bore to her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white landscape owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and their cou@@ sins of Mae Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when she went away from prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , the car was closer to a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car .
&quot; as it turned out , it was Harrison who prepared the Mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; closes in a FBI report .
it is obvious that it was a complete between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the murders , evidence of evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
bro@@ och made it even more distinctive .
it was a elect@@ oral massacre , &quot; said .
they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you vote , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade long , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual meeting of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is vivid , moving and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , by which many believe that he does not exist in America in America .
it is difficult to see , and more difficult to see , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because , because we are confronted with its ha@@ ss@@ es in us , &quot; said they said .
&quot; but I can not build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me , or don &apos;t want to hear what I made it . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - in a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene has made a well @-@ finished overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is an exclusive co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of boss C@@ lan@@ mit@@ gli@@ der for years , but he said that it will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so far , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we would not return to this time . &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sh@@ opper , and p@@ ushes forth , that he sle@@ pt with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said that --- He was sh@@ out of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then every ( at least all the black actors ) in the watch@@ man .
Gre@@ ene is the main battle .
what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ ar@@ able and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always still c@@ unning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t believe that white men back then &apos; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te one of the other black sh@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must only have the hard &apos; R. &apos; meeting . &quot;
and precisely , the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ er@@ ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy making this right , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the killed people .
the scene starts once again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
this re @-@ repeti@@ tion ends and quickly .
there are Schre@@ ie , shots and then silence .
a woman with a fun@@ eral dress , stands on the bodies of the actor and leads with Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos;s sad speech &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
their voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred metres away , you know a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes .
the public is almost ev@@ enly between black and white .
a pair is made from Ith@@ aca , New York to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they have lived for almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , and when bro@@ oks they run on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one took place in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , feels the air donated to the air .
when the final notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the quantity , closer to come and the body name to be inspired .
children of ho@@ cken to their heads , register the f@@ ake blood , and the silent body and volatile body .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ dering just a little boy , as he says it to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene of the amount - and suddenly is over .
the actor take the Lyn@@ ch@@ eil weg and w@@ ling their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw , Mar@@ bau@@ gh , a man played in the suit , who played a member member .
Nick Ras@@ cona is two of his co @-@ player , and breaks in their poor we@@ end together , the emotional load of the performance took place with him .
&quot; it is okay . &quot; it is okay , one of women .
&quot; we know that it is not in your heart .
you have done this from a reason . &quot;
later , the audience with acting acting for dinner together .
a white pair of Atlanta is excited about the down@@ ward with a black pair , which they &apos;ve got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought for the words to find the performance that has left the performance .
it &apos;s hard to hear this terrible words , and deeds which ... of people come to come , that as you look like to look like what they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what really want to do with me , believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going to go , &quot; says it , &quot; today the only police sc@@ ans is called . &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ och farm keeps at his table , he is reminiscent of the civil rights .
he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the return is in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we wear , but there is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
it &apos;s so if we know nothing to learn , then it may happen again .
who is not studying his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämm@@ erung &quot; con@@ cili@@ atory the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is part of the giant , six @-@ storey backdrop .
the script ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) can be equipped with a complete street corner and a brick @-@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; play@@ list and elast@@ omer &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or New York stock exchange .
before that par@@ ked a open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhine @-@ killing of a rock bands , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stacked oil barrels to Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ ist - Money , Power and Gi@@ er - that draws through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ ur@@ ers - inspired by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ica like already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess ver@@ ts her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) in Hollywood @-@ manipulation and give a Lei@@ che in the car room and give the Kra@@ Wal@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ fi@@ ese Hagen , which gives the A@@ ura of a heavy @-@ weigh@@ er box@@ ers .
brut@@ alized the scene when he bl@@ asph@@ em@@ es Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther also must take up Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience also made the ensemble with a powerful Ap@@ pl@@ ings .
stor@@ yt@@ ale will be celebrated , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who pre@@ dicts a modest and hands to Merkel un@@ resolved .
in the big case there is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in light of the big heat again in a single @-@ door structure .
the performance was expected to look at the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his register team .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ assing of the Pfei@@ f@@ aint concert in 2013 , there was five years later , in which the single &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; was under@@ ed .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be glad .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience had not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding for its vision .
I add a positive result .
max amount works as volunteers
they are working at several places in their volunteers .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt , the furniture exchange , once a week in a week , I stayed here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture lift .
and I already worked in the open day at the school .
how are your experience with this ?
quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , i.e. a late volunteer volunteer .
how does this ?
quantity : I made high school .
and then a construction studies , let &apos;s say we have been broken off .
I intended for me to work for me , that it is for me , and I want to work something else to work with people .
then I asked me what do you do .
add a social year , as there is an insight , as it can be seen as it is possible , in the focal point , perhaps , really is .
and it was so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter term of my studies .
I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and students in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not a bit unusual , while the volunteer corps has several different applications ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably still to be sure where you have been FS@@ J .
it can make it possible from retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of the social work .
I was very exciting .
I also was partly in the O@@ GS , thus in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing that led me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes back .
differently than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here &apos;s not about to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
we always has more people vor@@ m head , each one has a very different story behind .
whether a refugee - whether a refugee who has been picked up from the r@@ aus@@ ed family - one must still be individually custom@@ ised .
very interesting .
and they had no touch @-@ proof ?
quantity : this is not the type .
it is a range that there is a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there is also negative moments , but so it is life .

EPA returns to delay the Smo@@ g rule for delay of the Smo@@ g rule .
the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the government &apos;s government &apos;s government to delay the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 States def@@ endants the agency for the trial .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone protocol in 2015 , &quot; said she will show the commitment of the agency to work with states .
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with that we react to our governmental partners , &quot; said EPA head of Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , said in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt received the intention of EPA announced in June , in which a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ants are to be determined to determine where deposits are made to avoid stri@@ c@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 predominantly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ uman has tried to travel a wide range of environmental performance that is imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , to travel the economic growth of the economic growth .
the efforts , however , have caused the return of the Demok@@ rates and conservation groups that concerns concerns about the impact of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the in@@ hale of the air that o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and reduce the respiratory sympt@@ omatic &quot; such as asth@@ ma .
council : joint room
at the end , the decision was clearly stated : in two counter@@ voices , the council decides to set the establishment of a common room in the future car@@ ving facility in the future .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard Tj@@ aden .
even though it is still standing , until the end of the church of the church , there is now no plann@@ er for the creation of a private investor @-@ up project .
there is a discussion concerning a joint venture .
one of the two investors who are still available in the boat , is offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor it would be a living space - approximately 55 square meters and a adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council of Sweden , such a common room is not as meeting point only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ fer@@ ous dorm , but open to the church .
as an example made the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; round .
in this way , the decision to increase the provision of funding for the ongoing budget is already decided in the past autumn .
construction is building in the reconstruction of the building .
the facility of a common room would be , such as Tj@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ vey@@ ors .
it is possible to sign@@ alize in this regard to the investor , that there is no difference between the legs who speci@@ fying both traction - and as well as P@@ ult@@ roof - which means the height is reduced , and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
not necessary , not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be adding that addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously adopted the body .
it &apos;s not that simply goes on the common room .
Daniela has also points to the many own building , where you can &apos;t come to the right , the rest of the window is coming out of the window , &quot; she says : &quot; I do it to me . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks essential for the common room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
you can see a covered sub@@ vention in the income tax or even foreign investors .
that &apos;s not so , because with the purchase of the area there is no access , but can get a true , in the case of the case of the case .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , meeting the resolutions according to the resolutions , finds three prob@@ ates .
so , during two counter@@ voices in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller said : &quot; if we set the decision , we do a big step , then a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

four ends after tire plat@@ ters
in an accident on the A7 were badly damaged in four persons on Thursday afternoon .
for the first information , the driver of a Opel Zafira at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the position of the market , probably following a tire plat@@ ters that will control the control over his vehicle .
passenger car climbed to the right to the bows , where he struck himself and then stood on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly damaged during the accident .
during the initial supply of the rescue service , the A7 towards the north , was locked up for an hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ left strip of the accident took place .
Fort@@ a Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ erk@@ ette work better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes to the 2 : 2 to the beginning of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimization of def@@ ensive formation will take place in Au@@ e points .
with the first win of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as does not have the two Fo@@ rec@@ ore from 2 : 2 to Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two det@@ ent@@ ore too much , and we need even better fit in Au@@ e , &quot; says the ri@@ fl@@ es of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge , the tri@@ erk@@ ette should be optimized .
and a gate after a free , the Fort@@ ress would like to get more .
&quot; for the future , there is no more about Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team has also come to the experience in preparation with the tri@@ erk@@ ette , better than with the qu@@ ette .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will be involved in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is just one of the tri@@ cycle in the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build good build , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; a condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ica , and we are not able to offer us in setting up so many errors . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; whether you &apos;re talking about a mis@@ position by a mis@@ sl@@ ump start , don &apos;t know .
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular seasonal season . &quot;
nothing wanted to know his train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the start into the season I was only six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who don &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over an advantage because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken down because of an accident .
now they can begin the season with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e may even be a bit of fresh , because they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a asc@@ ension fav@@ ors in the bones .
but &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior def@@ enders of Fort@@ una .
from the Rhineland , guests can go from the Rhineland as a slight favorite on Sunday in the meeting place at last ( almost ) .
&quot; that &apos;s it away , because we have the claim to come from the first six , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is very positive , with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to go out of pre @-@ in , &quot; explains Fort@@ y .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t and over@@ crowded . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method to medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years older . but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( Socialist medi@@ cin@@ ate ) has started with the implementation of tests in the past year .
it was supposed to be the evaluation of the age in the age , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) because the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) were critic@@ ised for the age of some refugees .
the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now sent migration to 6.@@ 8@@ 80 and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , that the person is possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person is possibly 18 years old . &quot;
tests are being carried out only in cases where the age of person is put into question .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a major difference in statistics of the last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases in which the person is judged as over 18 years , is not necessarily that the asylum seek@@ ers will be absorbed over his age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases , the &quot; suggest that the every person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , it noted that in 243 of these cases , it had openly said that they will be 18 years old in this year .
the method of medical age assessment , at the x @-@ X @-@ recordings of concepts and MRI images of cre@@ atine that are analysed by dental crow@@ ns and radi@@ ologists , also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a script is the endo@@ k@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ olin@@ ska @-@ Institut whose work has taken the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had the reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not so do so if we could do it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ending the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child is able to assess one child in adults .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is below 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;

Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to perform new election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP &apos;s possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he will not return .
because he said on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament .
prior to previously , the surprising leave of a Green ME@@ Ps from their rural school in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s elections , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hannover lost its cr@@ ust one @-@ vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke Twe@@ sten founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; explains it on Friday in Hannover .
at the moment , CD@@ U &apos;s leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ mler is to recommend it to a faction .
so that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony @-@ Day , the SPD and Grü@@ ne 68 seats .
so far the relation was vice vers@@ a .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected to regular on the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ mler said that Red @-@ green State Government said to decide if they could continue without a majority further in this situation .
Stephan W@@ eil maintains an essential to decides that the day as quickly decides to decides to bring his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through their further procedure .
the state will also see the possibility that the prime minister of the prime minister &apos;s prime minister , and will select a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these options must be legally checked , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ mler .
&quot; you will discuss all questions regarding , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ mler was called T@@ we@@ bed@@ step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians himself emphasized : &quot; I am no surprise .
I feel very good . &quot;
she designated as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens required the ab@@ out@@ less MP on the return of their land rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , that she received their Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ at that she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the Green An@@ ja Pi@@ el Group said : &quot; we did the decision of El@@ ke Twe@@ ak . &quot;
they have decided to go deliberately setting out no indication in the faction .
&quot; even before the background , there were no thematic differences , we can &apos;t move this step . &quot;
the SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz was sentenced to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal of the Lower Saxony Green ME@@ Ps in El@@ ke Twe@@ ak .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green ME@@ Ps in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the vot@@ ers and vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Social Democratic Party on Friday .
he is supporting the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , to be re @-@ select the Land@@ day fast .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
their personal interests , and in their Fr@@ ust , their personal interests , and in their Fr@@ ust , the welfare of the country , critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony this dirty play and tried to beat out political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ s@@ ens CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction@@ als Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ mler we recommend to add El@@ ke Twe@@ ak into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD &apos;s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , expressed the result of a personal career with personal career as a result of the country &apos;s outcome of 2013 .

the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How to protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
discussed in Germany about infected eggs .
how could happen the sc@@ andal ?
how can protect consumers .
Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) focuses on the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) address and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can now protect consumers before po@@ ison eggs ?
I can only encourage consumer inside and consumers encouraging the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states are the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we all know what we know , a health care is virtually impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of Auf@@ klär@@ ers from the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs will not be perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the German states .
nevertheless , my house is going to be switched off and has been in tight exchange with the authorities of the countries in a close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all the information and the risk assessment are available for the consumer .
the trade is the same as the manufacturer to worry , that the sold @-@ selling products are capable of transport and health benefits .
if in eggs of the rear level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not obligatory .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time do not do the companies school .
are sit in production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the fore@@ seen knowledge , the company does not exist any immediate debt .
in fact , they have to calculate illegal employment practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a bit cl@@ ash in the harvest .
is missing only at staff or even at the flush @-@ jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth also belongs to the truth and a criminal energy has never been excluded at 100 percent .
this is why there are a consistent information for such events , and hand@@ over to the legislation in the cases where they may have a crucial importance .
I &apos;ve already clearly made several times it , that I expect from the responsible authorities for an additional information in education .
is the regular alarm clock in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer products and consumers have the right to get a safe and easy @-@ to @-@ use food .
if a non @-@ insec@@ ti@@ cide in@@ hal@@ ci@@ dal is used in the food industry , consumer products are depri@@ ved of consumer and consumer .
by the ge@@ aring funds , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are taking into a situation that absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ zi@@ ds Fi@@ pr@@ oni@@ l is not acceptable in the attitude of life @-@ animals and must be terminated .
it must be consistently pursued and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the relevant authorities to clari@@ fy the facts , and supp@@ ressed .
how to move the financial rules to Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris .
the rules , which aim to aim to prevent un@@ prevented issues of the European football , ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , for the management organization that the European game is supervised the power to provide access to the most prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA Champions League , that PS@@ G does not mean that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without a great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 millions Euro ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian government &apos;s contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a content that will be worth a number of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make your money to make the money , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes , and put it into a gal@@ axy other stars , in light of the financing of the teams through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
Ver@@ ily allowed to purchase a lot to purchase a lot of money , but must do with legi@@ timi@@ dation sources , which allow them to enable the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in their view on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini for the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine , who had experienced enormous debt after the success of tremendous debts , had effectively dis@@ b@@ ating effectively and ris@@ ki@@ cked up their support if banks or owners have moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of its losses .
the amend@@ ment meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ k originally purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the crew and to build a global brand to achieve a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P fee , which runs up to 2018 , clubs can take losses in amount of € 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini had fallen by the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to shake off .
&quot; surely is FF@@ P is dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ as , who is responsible for the UEFA Under FF@@ P , representing the Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G buy @-@ out Kl@@ au@@ sel from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package deal , it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the absorption rate can be adjusted for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 opened the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City in the possession of Manchester City .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at the time of 82 million dollars ) , and it was arranged to be reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged for the Champions League of the 2014 @-@ 15 season on 21 players instead of a normal 25 player .
the UEFA is searching for clubs , which could try to out@@ bound their financial support by companies by companies that are associated with the owners of a clubs .
while a disast@@ rous company could target PS@@ G if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA does not apply as a legitimate child .
exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ings of the PSA tourism Authority has been burnt .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to payments by the Organ@@ i@@ zing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have been cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be easy to find out a kind of man@@ oeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA Adju@@ stment er will be able to note any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEFA had no consistent talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , fabulous on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said , under the condition of An@@ onymous with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they didn &apos;t have to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be released .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing of Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dising and tri@@ cot .
the association goes out that sales after the signature is at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly lab@@ elled to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s to prevent them that PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
it is a clear case of &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; said president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of the principal owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the privil@@ eges of La League against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect to finance the financial play of Fair@@ play , because there are different ways or different interests if a country has a so great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new shock suppliers
in the past years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y on board chocolate is made for Swiss Swiss .
now in front of a possible end , the airline writes the contract from a possible end : the airline writes the order .

industry survey estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nordwest@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mi@@ ros daughter generated annual revenue of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is always the promotional effect : for a Scho@@ g@@ gi@@ ist manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
as many applic@@ ants there are at the new announcement , the Swiss don &apos;t want to claim Swiss .
only Swiss manufacturers are only come to question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to get a renewal of renewal in the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest chocolate manufacturers had not been reached for a statement .
chocolate plates distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .

in addition , the officials had larger quantities of mari@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , shr@@ ine We@@ ap@@ ons and several hundreds of thousands of euro safely .
at the same raid in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the Italian Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .

at the action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the m@@ af@@ ia is accused of drug @-@ violence , heavy violence , accused murder , as well as Rau@@ b and Aw@@ b .

according to the register , the information is estimated that ten million people with foreign national nationality , including approximately 5.7 million of non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by about 600 out@@ country authorities in Germany .
because the data is not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality is not been well maintained .

the decision to no change comes , after the latest dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth rate increases the rise of interest in the second quarter of 0.2 % and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected in the third quarter tot@@ aling 0.3 % , although it is easy to recover by the Bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and little content of sal@@ aries , since the disappearance is even worse , before they will receive better .
in addition , they explained that monetary policy in the next few years can not prevent the income statement , &quot; but they added , that wages grew significantly in the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds , which is a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision is coming after lowering the interest rates on 0,@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cked EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the panic .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this is the prices and the economy is fully reaching .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last verdict , the Bank has increased to the interest rates after a interest rate , since the inflation increased its pressure on hard households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July signed an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this is expected to move again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the transfer in relation to their goal of 2 % is to be assigned to the weak Po@@ unds .
Andrew Mont@@ es@@ the@@ , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage , said : &quot; in view of the short@@ ened decline of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to search for stores and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks good for those who run the existing De@@ als , and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are close and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( the National Health Organization ) should be cont@@ acting HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people .
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV @-@ pre@@ ven@@ tional treatment in September after a battle against funding in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one of the inter@@ course acting on inter@@ risk hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk of high risk risk with around 86 percent , now from the health service to a first three year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he explained to fund the trial , after the Court of Court confirmed that the Court of App@@ eals had confirmed that the N@@ HS agreed to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the asser@@ tion to finance the local authorities .
on Thursday , the author Simon Stev@@ ens was welcomed by N@@ HS England &apos;s chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while National Ai@@ ds Trust ( NAT ) was called &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will belong to the first part that will follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 .
prevention of hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV medications which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transfer with infection &apos;s disease .
pr@@ EP before inter@@ course means that even enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent a HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual inter@@ course .
to one person who come to question for the treatment , are pregnant or bis@@ exual , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV @-@ status is not known due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor &apos;s doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual Clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England , signed a contract for delivery of medications in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study is to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , by clinical evidence , and implemented in a large scale , and implemented by a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the extensive and becoming increasingly successful efforts for the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in which more than three decades continued progress in impair@@ ment of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer of the NAT ( National Ai@@ ds Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is dedicated to needs and dangerous people , the possibility to change the English HIV @-@ epide@@ mic .
people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is subject to a partnership with a partner , what leads to improve many , many life .
we welcome the announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must be realized that the study is done quickly in the country and that no one who has left the risk of HIV .
now , as the EP testing medicine was abol@@ ished , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ positive people . &quot;
Sharon &apos;s son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; at the beginning of the Pr@@ EP trial , after months of late @-@ late @-@ late ren@@ ditions , and re@@ lu@@ sion@@ ed through the government and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is so fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV are infected with HIV are infected to contribute to HIV in the society that we will come closer to HIV in the society .
the great lives live : mezzanine and smart designer tricks , this small Ear@@ ls Court is home to a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not have their pockets .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
I love me in love and made a bid for this day . &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square feet was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a fl@@ ake layout - you had to go to the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to get to the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted to high ceilings , great windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; says it .
to this end , she asked the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ HE@@ D from Not@@ ting Hill , which was easy to use high ceilings and a home which was not only a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne .
the blanket was not big enough to place two rooms on each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , in which one could stand on .
Er@@ fan had to think about it to solve the release .
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms as arranged that they were covered with each other , without that we had to g@@ aps .
it wasn &apos;t just to build a simple platform , but the steel so that he had the right height for the function or down the right height . &quot;
this arrangement makes it possible to place two rooms in full height with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper area of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us is looking down to the gl@@ am@@ our@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Lighting set up the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ es plays a role at the execution of theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short cor@@ rid@@ ors is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer than any longer .
in the kitchen , the spi@@ kes like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mir@@ ro@@ red space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ ism space , the beauty of the living room is shared by the kitchen , if it is not used .
together , there are nothing new .
the special feature of this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering was come in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered in MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is too important , so that when you move the door high , very easy to do . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne also has an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the ground surface - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate and a real estate is based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to use the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials to use the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and the therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t get you in electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your hearts . &quot;
it shows that an apartment has a good design and elevated square met@@ er@@ ence of something like standard in a bit of balance .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you might decide to decide these not .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars in real estate .
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate in Vict@@ ori@@ as , worth $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their ownership and their business is divided .
Paul wished to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation will take place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers 38 real estate worth over half a billion dollars , accumulated , since the family has purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis , now offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late Father , Colin - from Paul as &quot; chief operators and the dominant personality , &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s wealth and Paul is about one @-@ third .
a judicial system states that Colin owned that Colin owned the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be proved for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the &quot; Colin proposed candidates have left him with the left , which I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in one of the first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ vit in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed intermedi@@ aries the first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling was held .
the brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Colin , such as Paul claims against him .
Colin argued that this is not true but acc@@ uses Paul before , some owners and competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ vit , which was submitted by Colin , he says , he hope to plan the fight .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family has the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs climb in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
wife De Lu@@ tis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and gourmet shops in the late 1950 &apos;s age and in the early se@@ venti@@ es , a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
you used the security to buy coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ er family .
Colin says that he began in West@@ co there when he was a little child in my last years , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to continue their property on her sons .
&quot; Luigi said often told me that he never wanted to land &quot; brethren , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not more part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , with Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke as well as Mark are , says Paul , says Paul , &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very returned , although he was a former AF@@ L Board member and after a biography in 2015 from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took up with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case is before the dishes .
&quot; it is very sad , that my brother Paul decided to hearing me , and write our family names through the courts &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father would not be able to say that Paul and I would like to fight in our current fight , &quot; said he says , &quot; he was still on a solution . &quot;
on Friday , these hopes are over .
&quot; our issue is solved in the near future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff is planning to vali@@ date the media det@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly it really do .
when yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to hold the information flow on President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the chef on a reduced price .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
in John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , on his first day of work with executive officers he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Weiß@@ em House , which he says : bad information that follows the hands of the President .
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow , whether on paper or in letters - because the President &apos;s better decisions meet , if he would get good information . &quot;
cell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to monitor Tr@@ isha , by increasing its media monitoring .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps long relationship is back for decades - and now , where he is still in the White House , is still strong in the White House .
&quot; if the candidate of Tr@@ uman had been productive due to an un@@ fair reporting it was more productive to convince him that he was able to convince him that he was to convince themselves , &quot; said the former voting consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February , compared to the police .
politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter be under control , according to six former presidential campaign , to ensure that his personal media sum has a ste@@ ered lob@@ b@@ ation . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter be ever under control , &quot; is ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign officials had something , what we do not know that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets without their interventions were still included .
we will probably find something about the Twe@@ ets , which has not sent out Tr@@ ump .
if his staff was doing it already some times , sle@@ ger of him , and then do their efforts were worth it .
but no one has to prevent it , that tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y is wor@@ sen@@ ed .
a part of the problem is that the people in a White House which consists of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by increasing tr@@ ump material , which promotes their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite with this story - reported in May through the pre@@ love of consultants , president of a strategic reasons .
this was an example of which was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to respond to negative press lines , especially those with damaged le@@ aning , and that he can find out to find out why they come out .
exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave a printed copy of an article by Got@@ ovina , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who acc@@ using the deputy commander of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a Cluster of Lec@@ tures &quot; at the White House .
even though Johnson has been banned from Twitter , or it has no concrete evidence , or it has been in the past &apos;s false alle@@ g@@ ations , saying that it has been false .
Tr@@ isha read the article and started to ask people over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
in addition , the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the papers and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how has the fol@@ t ?
Kelly tried to do three months later .
perhaps he will prove more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but tr@@ ump is still his self @-@ effective self , and his advis@@ ors are still subject to influence .
this un@@ altered factors make cell@@ ys mission very difficult .
master &apos;s master will get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is worship and hopes .
police in all of Europe sent to dangerous crimin@@ als in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the escape .

Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU must follow &quot; -@@ Ad@@ vent@@ kal@@ ender from winter .
the experience would have shown that many wings of the holiday destination , it was the name of Euro@@ pol .
you &apos;ve compiled 21 Post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there are the web site www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times was seen .

some of the weal@@ thi@@ est household owners in West Mid@@ lands will again be tra@@ ded with some of the travelers who had tra@@ ded out one of the parish church to demand a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ ge , which is called &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they have horses , babies and an army from transport@@ ing after they were removed not to be removed from the Council , without having been removed from the Council to prevent their deposits .
the tak@@ ing group found a gap in the defence systems and cr@@ ushed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ restra@@ ined to find a way to find a way .
there have been the Council of Soli@@ es , who said that it is &quot; us@@ eless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; You are there on the Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they were thrown into the passengers .
the Council must be forced to be forced to be forced to be forced , as he was us@@ eless with the problem .
the travel@@ er were in May there , were moved back and are back now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
it added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to make it possible to protect their parks to protect their parks .
I am staying at the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my council if the Council cannot stop once stop . &quot;
a people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of travelers only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokesperson of the council of Soli@@ ds said : &quot; we are aware of a dis@@ fu@@ ze camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps , so quickly as soon as possible .
to help our Be@@ ing collection , it is very important that as many of the inhabitants are a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , by creating 101 to call 101 .
this carries out to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must check when we must check our case . &quot;

from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of Freuden@@ stadt is currently renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
the are good news for the city .
because the closure of the hotels Bir@@ k@@ enhof was lost by the then in@@ ambi@@ ence company mbH . as of April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30 000 overnight stays per year , and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in the fall of 2014 , in view of the numbers of refugees who came to the District of the District , the hotel building is offered as a collective accommodation in respect of controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the use of a construction plan to secure the territory as hotel site .
the decision was not in@@ controversial in the church at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt @-@ mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and spoke at the time of ern@@ st@@ growing interested parties at the house .
he should retain right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ancements began with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back on a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .

floors have been torn , ceilings to the part open , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is an only building site .
until March there is still a lot to do .

everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms will be equipped with big walk @-@ in showers , the input area is converted , it will be built new window .

the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to be exact exactly .
almost under one million euros , it reck@@ ons .

Russia @-@ affair : U.S. Special Jury sets a Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump is scheduled to have a presentation of the so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the body has recorded work in the past weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under reference to the thing .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has extended its investigation and intensi@@ fying its investigations .
CNN reported CNN reported the first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
US secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer , specifically to have mixed into the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether they were between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o Tr@@ ump went into the centre , and on the privil@@ ege to see whether the President is wor@@ sen@@ ate during the affair during the affair .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence to check out in possible failure , and decide whether the charge is cancelled .
Grand Jur@@ ys should therefore be called anchor chain .
mostly , it is switched on if there are larger and controversial cases .
the process is always run behind closed doors .
the body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the interro@@ gation of egg .
according to the transm@@ it@@ ters CNN were already inv@@ itations to join the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons , who were involved in the meeting were asked to be called on a statement that was called on the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ unk J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign of Paul Man@@ af@@ ort .
the experts were told on Thursday evening in the US television that the condition is showing that Mu@@ eller should not be able to work out in his work , and that it should be necessary , soon to be quick .
but it is not inevit@@ ably noted that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nonetheless , the reduction of the committee in the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to meet the occupying force for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new dis@@ closure used by the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia in order to provide the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Demok@@ rates a chance to feel &quot; good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they may speak . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained a statement that he was nothing of a Grand Jury .
this work is also commonly used in the case of sal@@ aries , he emphasized .
the White House testi@@ fy any measures aimed accelerated the work of the special intermedi@@ ary on the &quot; f@@ aire . &quot;
the former FBI chef James Com@@ ey had said three times that , not against the President .
I have no reason to accept that something changed , the name was in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller was only used to go to Tr@@ uman Com@@ ey after Tr@@ uman Com@@ ey .
because of this problem , the accus@@ ations had become tr@@ ump at Tr@@ isha , he would like to do justice for the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , according to a setup of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president stands for an investigation under large pressure .
following presentation of US media , the White House collected the White House Material against the Sonder@@ forschungs@@ bereich and his staff .
dis@@ counted spec@@ ul@@ ators moreover , as Tr@@ unk Mu@@ eller will be released from whether Tr@@ uman Mu@@ eller is released .
contrary to an independent special edition of the Congress , Richard Nixon , the President of the President , Richard Nixon , has given us a position in which he theore@@ tically elected to the President of the Department of Justice .
several transm@@ it@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic Senate delivered on Thursday , after which the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o could not be released more so simple .
Ant@@ ark@@ tis : huge Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ c@@ tica a huge ic@@ e@@ berg surrounded by the barely seven @-@ fold size Berlin@@ s from Sch@@ el@@ ag .
that was the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday evening .
the vast majority of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large coloni@@ sts now come to the north and will probably need two , three years , until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres long@@ itude and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant , the researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger of people is not coming from him .
in@@ wi@@ ev@@ ement of climate change played a role at the demo@@ li@@ tion of the Eis@@ berg , is un@@ clear according to research data .
a total of some 30 years , it has been a series of unusual con@@ vey@@ ors of ic@@ icle in the region , writes the US @-@ Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a facsimile background .

however , the loss of the shr@@ ub is that the glaci@@ ers can easily flow into the sea and much faster than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , however , only in low size , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ go is after A@@ WI @-@ data and nearly 50 000 square kilometers , Antar@@ ctic &apos;s fourth @-@ largest shr@@ ine of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
on the mainland from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front of the sea , around 200 meters .
there is regular regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural way to climate change , the ic@@ plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y by the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; that is the most comprehensive retreat since the beginning of the Chron@@ icle , &quot; also confirmed .
under scientists be cont@@ ested , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ holidays will again grow back or long @-@ term , he said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that there will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though this researcher did not lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on the climate change , so in the past decades , however , many ice strings of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula fall away .
this long tip of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends in the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
this rise was contributed to the temperature increase .
in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic peninsula have passed around three degrees Celsius and is thus among the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to stand with the staff at the staff
because it is harder to occupy free to occupy free positions , the CD@@ U , from the employers association to be more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has reached 41 new positions in management .
more than 1100 employees and officials working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 inter@@ ns have their first working day behind .
the apprenti@@ ces in circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 applic@@ ants were registered for this year .
nevertheless , the district continued staff to tackle the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are at circle M@@ ett@@ mann to like 50 non @-@ occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers , are working as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative of the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG who take the initiative and join the professional sc@@ anners in the administration .
following the request of the parties &quot; a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development work . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements to professionals , but to be pioneering the applic@@ atory act of the application , it &apos;s called .
the overall concept should look back to inside and outside , effective measures for cross @-@ workers and show an apprenti@@ ces offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds itself after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems , which you didn &apos;t know it earlier .
other cities wer@@ ies good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the address is from a real &quot; competition in the public employer . &quot;
this is a high number of employees , the disease , or age @-@ related reasons to the service .
so that &apos;s the highest time , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but in his party , Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , Fra@@ ction of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request .
he had already been in@@ scri@@ bed in the chal@@ k day for a fine surprise , when he exhibited the personnel paid public in question , and the other parties were astonishing .
peoples wants to verify that all the possibilities are checked , which allow an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; if we do not come to a satis@@ fying solution , the government management should be with the trade unions - maybe also in cooperation with the circular cities - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ an@@ aim , &quot; so peoples .
in order to pay attention to CD@@ U , the employees and officials to pay better than the public service for the opening of the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases , or more money , if you are in a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the creation are more grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees were to take care of the new pro@@ stitutes Protection Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy more tigh@@ tened to the sound to NGO migrants .
Italy , NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue their operations for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Marco M@@ inn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities have had a boat by the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Un@@ et &apos; , because of their team had collaborated with the conc@@ essions in a way which had illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation since a year in operation , is rejected by a detailed incident of the Italian national wal@@ den Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . sorry , we are very happy that we will not work in the search and rescue area , &quot; said the organization said in a opinion about social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can rely on all the accus@@ ations which are currently registered only when we collected all the information and the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Un@@ et &apos; , the Iu@@ vent@@ a , since October .
however , it is believed that its crew can be delivered directly on board , which can be delivered directly from human tra@@ ilers to them , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such was re@@ union found just 1.3 miles before the coast of the coast , according to the Ak@@ te of the prosecutor , whose content of Italian media has been published .
the crew is suspected to have committed about the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue missions in the zone of humanitarian reasons , and not from any other mo@@ tive surveillance .
under the code of code , boats like Iu@@ vent@@ a have to have an Italian police officers , who supervised its activities .
only three of the nine NGOs culmin@@ ated in search and rescue operations , have so far explained to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be as un@@ necessary , but acceptable , because they would not be &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue missions would be .
among those who refused to sign the Nobel @-@ prize organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) is the Nobel Prize of Nobel Prize .
M@@ inn@@ iti said , &quot; the number of migrants who had returned to Italy in the last weeks , resulting in the past weeks that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and co @-@ operation with the local civil society .
&quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan civil society in this month about economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger , and Mali along the reduction of the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope to reach Europe .

Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing has a long time with the question .
for the Professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sports is a Sport , because he is a peti@@ tiveness and many biological and physical reactions , which can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
moreover , there are cognitive capabilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response rate .

&quot; the f@@ itte players is a good player &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2016 we have implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly by advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and large tournaments .

against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league is little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts adopted by Conrad Roy to the suicide of suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their sentence behind Git@@ tern and five years were exposed to the currency .
Carter was sentenced in June of July 2014 by his conduc@@ tivities of Conrad Roy , who was sentenced to life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ inhabited .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay up until the appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both of both and Mr Roy had suffered a mental illness .
red colo@@ uring and a cre@@ amy coloured bl@@ use , stood Carter , with tears in the eyes , when they were sentenced to eyes with the hands of the eyes and when they were sentenced to eyes .
&quot; their actions , Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor of the Court .
&quot; you finished his life to make their own better better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; said she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no Reu@@ ben was shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said , &quot; It was a &quot; terrible change@@ over , &quot; it was totally un@@ fortunate . &quot;
judges Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not found that her &quot; age or tire @-@ wheel , or even their cler@@ gy have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a Prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy , that there is no day that I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to know that he is proud and how I try to go with everything . I try , despite all of my pain , which we carry for etern@@ ity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they were &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; that they will never be able to participate in the wedding &apos;s wedding or an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; no more than this one person , with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain that I will always retain for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts there is a crime that makes it to be committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 , and was found dead in a vehicle .
the case referred to national attention after Car@@ ters text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; star@@ g you on , spring of a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many paths , &quot; she said in several news that she was sent to death in two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on holiday .
in the eye of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing what you need to do is to change the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought me attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they may benefit from any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .

companies happy with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ an Minister : economy : economy . tempo
it is often con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was the Minister of State of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in the office after more than a year , in which the new Economy Minister Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
K@@ ammern and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy and t@@ ooth@@ ed at the same time the old Minist@@ erial Conference .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the association Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wiss@@ ing does not have the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest concert of the country is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ er of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on the priorities of the country as well .
still , this year , the Ministry of planning is expected to set up the construction law until 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country is also playing the West@@ um@@ he@@ ung Trier , which stands in the fore@@ front required demand for the Federal Tra@@ cking plan .
the goal is to take into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann &apos;s award .

Trier and Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is excited to stop the wines of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to stop sales in supermarkets in the supermarkets and the trend for ten years .
in addition , Wiss@@ ing is an open ear ring for people who want to form a own company , lo@@ aves the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier is in the new master bonus , an additional incentive for young inter@@ ns , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is intended to make a premium of 1000 euros for the Ingre@@ dient and 2500 Euros , when graduates within ten years after the master education .
the house tasks for the country remains however long .
in the planned road construction are easy to create facts , also f@@ le it is the country at the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main managing director of the I@@ HK Trier .

the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
in addition , CD@@ U @-@ S vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the computer , the country &apos;s investment in 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads as proposed .
in addition , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the professional sc@@ ars in the region .
it was also the previous wide range of broadband construction in the country .

Audi should change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers can see with a counter@@ reaction .
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would be able to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said , the company said that &quot; more intelligent options are available as driving on restrictions , &quot; which is based on European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there were three million Mercedes @-@ vehicles in Europe , to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the sub@@ contractor as a call .
European autom@@ akers have greatly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States , to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are em@@ itted as a car@@ ot@@ gene@@ ous and can cause asth@@ ma .
the cost of the car manufacturer , equipment for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , are also available to keep it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also tried to ignore the powerful car companies and indications of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen to avoid that the use of so @-@ called on @-@ off devices , emissions were able to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but by normal conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ yn@@ amik was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , Itali@@ ans , and is therefore not protected against extradition and could be turned into court in the United States .
in the beginning of this year , Audi used a criminal investigations in Volkswagen in the beginning of this year , after the authorities have installed Audi use a system to b@@ ypass emissions standards in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could benefit Volkswagen hard &apos;s : the luxury car manufacturer carries out disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most released Carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ man , the button of his figures are his trademark .
with 85 , the Argent@@ ines still works and works on a film .
his message is laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there are too much tree in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants .
in the first years as an artist , he smote him as a dra@@ fts@@ man for gambling as a dra@@ ined cards - which makes him fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he managed to get a breakthrough in the late six@@ ties : with the publication of his Carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
once again , the artist inspired by the cities .
large , ro@@ omy mor@@ di@@ llo @-@ figures tum@@ bled in drawings with the rail tower of Pisa , big bin in London and the Red Platz in Moscow .

since six years he has been working in an animation and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thous@@ and@@ ular ss@@ ler as counter@@ player .
for the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , the 2019 is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what they shall tell it , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written from him .
therefore he sets more on the TV series , which is produced as its original drawings , which is produced .

Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the plant in Provence was exposed to the effects of climate change , which has much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impacts on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades transfers , and with very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
Lav@@ en@@ del@@ ine oil not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and weak@@ ened either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
these solutions , which are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the soil , but also the supply of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water , and the development of varieties that are exposed to dry resistance .

the assassination of a journalists emphas@@ ising the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly magazine Ri@@ odo@@ ce meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a , organised crime , cor@@ rup@@ ted officials and un@@ de@@ filed drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routine tests .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what more saf@@ er : they should take their kids to the office in 2009 that they were with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or at home .
the experts have three words to a panel on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , associations .
ask the Rep@@ orter , name for each column - no evidence is necessary to do truth and abdominal .
there are drug @-@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to have suspected on the content list of the government or the cart@@ ons , a catalog of bre@@ asts that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no difference of violence , and throughout the country , and throughout the land , there are no more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has taken place in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been exp@@ elled from attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were seven deaths in seven states .
among the latter is her editor and her cont@@ act@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest bug is to live in Mexico , and to be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .
his order is deeply welcome , although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts , which show his s@@ mil@@ ing face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take less than two months after his death , and re@@ porter about their shared themes , the g@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , Par@@ an@@ oia .
although in 2010 , a probe was built in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , these were initiated by the Committee on protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as in most thousands of Mor@@ den , which are associated with drug @-@ drug and organized crimes , are given to the kill@@ ers of journalists only rarely before court .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they are still able to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ inhabited and even though the terrain is now still bud@@ get@@ ary .
without information about the mort@@ ar , without justice , the meeting became a discussion of safety , &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra , &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very dum@@ b , my time in this workshop , &quot; says he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the War@@ um , mis@@ str@@ ust we all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he abol@@ ished it just a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla started out of two men . it was poured out of his car and 12 times , presumably written on him because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the Schütz@@ e drove in his car and damaged close to your car .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults children .
rum@@ ors of rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the theme of Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing as a tail .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans , last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as ri@@ val@@ zing fragments were fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it &apos;s nothing to be shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or even several people on the road are shot , or that the cemetery is full of dedicated , two @-@ storey Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug cooking , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget it for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranqu@@ ility &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez is aware of the dangers of his work was Is@@ mail Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believed that two abuse of mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
initially in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ isi@@ tive anti@@ trust policy in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have taken the sons of the issue , suspected the power members of each copy of the issue , as soon as they delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had the same history , the country has to leave the country to his own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did it , that he would always be there .
in 2003 , he served as an experienced Rep@@ orter of Nor@@ o@@ este , who joined Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s foundation in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without losing the noise problem , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper served a reputation for the mu@@ e@@ tigen and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took part .
re@@ porter it , hard @-@ ap@@ ert@@ ure studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication given in which they could read stories that no one could be able to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot &apos;s award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the protection of journalists from the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he gave himself up to fear that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to pass on further , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award .
drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ s@@ vi@@ ento in last October .
&quot; you must assume the task to take you as a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what you have done in view of many dead ... why did you not said what ? &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun , who like a harbour workers , was able to make a friend who knew the gener@@ al@@ arm@@ ing and advice , a teacher who knew how to be survived .
they trusted in its routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always always sit down to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and there always sit in the same table .
well ask her : was his love for routine use ?
his death also has forced them to pursue their own attack in question , how they can do their work on the best , and to stay alive .
&quot; you don &apos;t like it , if you &apos;re talking to their wives , their children , their clean stores , their native home and lan@@ ders , to move drugs to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ sur and self @-@ ster@@ ling .
his own Inst@@ ink@@ ers trust .
if it is wrong , lead out of it .
the trouble is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be worn ... and then the thing with J@@ avier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and other states , are no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ se , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ rou@@ ts , weak institutions and cor@@ rup@@ ts government officials is home .
the landscape changes steadily .
in the room where the employees met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to safety training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days before , Spyware , which was sold exclusively on governments , to monitoring the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a building .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a fourth @-@ quarter district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the sh@@ ear , we asked some of the re@@ porter , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who had the governor itself as a tru@@ st@@ worthy being .
it is months ago , since the re@@ porter in the mountain scenery , where the drug tra@@ ps are facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has made three main stories on three main stories .
there was the assassination of his brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the national expenditure that focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led to one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the government , an ab@@ duction .
there was no official word that was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so it was pru@@ dence that everyone in the city knows that every one in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally recur@@ rent development and authorities .
an re@@ porter from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political party , which belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which has been ruled all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of corruption for high @-@ performance cases of corruption .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter about the previous events in this location , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military service .
just a few months before@@ hand , the readers of Val@@ dez , as the best informed about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; El FL@@ ACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its slim body composition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our springs are broken . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the Mor@@ de from journalists . because the staff had become something important what they have never been expected , activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ ent , Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez Sn@@ app@@ te himself a few signs and went to a demonstration on a demonstration due to another journalists from the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his position .
in the whole country , journalists had been stronger , by being written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on content because of buildings and buildings .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is a director of Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington and tried to collect international support for the Justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to re@@ plen@@ ish journalists and they bring it to the truth .
she has since then asked that it was once again divided from the government , because it is wor@@ ried about their anger was hurt in the government .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime , involved in the government officials and an equally valid company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that Rep@@ or@@ ters will not only be killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , organised the organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico , you &apos;d like to hit the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously , the Mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
no one fer@@ mented the death of the B@@ log@@ ist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the Northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as before six years ago .
her body was found along with a note , which was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as &apos;s Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am because of my report . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ sets apart from their ab@@ rupt head .
some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assassination of Cor@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others will continue to go like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug box with a guide on the title page &quot; What do you want to talk about us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still searching for the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are ad@@ jour@@ ned , as it seems the photographers Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , there is a daily dance with risk @-@ free decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once said to be the po@@ ets , gives him that the drug can be sc@@ aled him .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and therefore I was re@@ porter in re@@ porter . &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , than once all their phones to sums up .
a number of shooting plants with band@@ en@@ dow@@ ment and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had to leave the dead .
the war was continued , as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assies in the region .
from the on @-@ board , they have released the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website via mobile phone .
the title page was changed to the next day .
si@@ ren@@ s in the vicinity - a more shooting in the area .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view to the police , the guard held to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they had afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also remember that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day , on the J@@ avier , the intern@@ ship of anti@@ n was asked to send them to the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs are using cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to avoid his enemies
on the first glance , it looks like a statue , if a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now , researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ ts of a Canadian government were so well received that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well that they could even recognize that his sli@@ pp@@ skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; invisible past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology , &quot; called him as &quot; the harv@@ ested Din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the d@@ ossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbelievable good original condition , researchers , who described it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports , National Geographic , the ge@@ p@@ anz@@ ee plant f@@ ress@@ er is the best preserved F@@ ossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was found on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ flower Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed to be at the surrounding rock f@@ ehl on the Plat@@ ze , and he decided to take more precisely .
the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years with the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 lbs ) .
after all of these hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are only blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has sle@@ pt : &quot; the main writer Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature is to see . &quot;
it will be found in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best received din@@ osau@@ rs copies - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant f@@ ress@@ er , though he is covered with a arm@@ or covered tanks , likely to be threatened by flesh and din@@ osau@@ rs .
the badly damaged din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to hide them , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technology that is known as counter @-@ lab@@ eled , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix better to its surroundings and its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier took place in May for the first time and is now available in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studying the wild animal and it &apos;s Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed to document Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and shape of shoes and arm@@ our through his body .
they discovered the con@@ cre@@ ting , an spread defense method in animal , which means that the top of the cre@@ ature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the contamination is common , the results are surprisingly low as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond the today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs are ge@@ ared by enough printing by eating din@@ osau@@ rs . the evolution of the confron@@ tation was used as a means of excess life .
but most of the animals that use the sh@@ aded sh@@ ady , you think of Reh@@ e , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ate than prey , what sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to an authentic survival .
&quot; strong Rau@@ b@@ tier behavior on a massive , strongly ge@@ p@@ anz@@ ler din@@ osau@@ rs have been shown how to have been dangerous to have the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of din@@ osau@@ rs was rot@@ ein .
scientists continue to examine the animal in information about his life , including its con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs when he died , died in a river and dropped to the sea , where he dropped on the back to the sea .
at this time Alberta was Alberta as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landing when they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because he has covered completely with con@@ served skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
the result is that the animal remains almost as in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need a lot of imagination to use it to re@@ construct . if you throw only a little with the eyes , you might believe that it is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermop@@ op@@ ods , carni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who walked on two legs who walked through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ge@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was captured by some of his fur@@ y ancestors .
this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 walk ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest developments in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sc@@ aled down after the death in the sea and mud mu@@ ddy .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he was found on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ flower Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the be@@ ek@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is complete from the sn@@ ail to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained 2 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that were ra@@ zed by its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the p@@ anz@@ ee plant f@@ ress@@ er was shot through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river in the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs are kept his dogs in exquisite item detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well @-@ preserved that the bon@@ net is still standing in the din@@ osau@@ rs and cover the din@@ osau@@ rs .
like Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Geographic , it is such a level of preservation so &apos; rare as a profit in Lot@@ to .
ever more I see it , the more confused it is .
the remains of the skin , always cover the hol@@ iness of the skin , always carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his re@@ chter front lies on his side , his five @-@ finger are divided into the top .
I can count the sheds on its sole .
in th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age : many wounded .
hard accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , square kilometres long rod and g@@ aff@@ er .
at the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , the late Thursday afternoon at an Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age was injured 20 people .
according to the first figures of the police at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the end of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a plum@@ bing almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , in@@ doors .
about the exact number of the compar@@ es were no information before .
it was greater for light to moderate injuries , said a police pre@@ cher .
a great bid to rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was closed towards Munich .
in the circuit of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre long rear ride .
as a AZ re@@ porter , it was also reported on the way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire , listed the identification of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle , which is now able to calculate with sensitive stra@@ ps .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car and passenger car with a coll@@ ision between the car and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that has seen almost every once more , has nothing to be sitting in the train or bad .
or one is reduced to his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ets .
the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ anting has one uns@@ hi@@ ft or walk the passenger for passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn are currently the dedicated road@@ card control .
it &apos;s easy to use by mobile , that you have taken his seat and take the ticket to the ticket .
currently , a test run on two routes .
&quot; we offer the offer , wide and wide . &quot;
then , by the beginning of this year , there will be available for many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a rail speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; calls the train de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner .
to use the use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : one need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have a online ticket , which already do most passengers already do .
you have to have purchased it about the app , DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable way of your ticket reservation .
and most recently you need a seat reservation .
for the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as : one rises to the train , calls for his trip under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
when the test customers will then be a button to electronic de@@ valuation .
the train guide will get on their mobile devices a message that passenger X is located in the train , and the booked seating space is taken .
if the train &apos;s train is made at room Y knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ lock online ticket .
so , you can continue to pass on further , continue in silence .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which again use the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel without a ticket control through our train staff , ch@@ ann@@ elling the DB Navigator just itself .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB correspondence .
second Plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
if you often cross country , knows that in addition to tasting and missed trains , the ticket checks are to the biggest sle@@ eves .
for often , one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the people don &apos;t need all documents that need to use online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or number of identity card or otherwise a document that you must be prec@@ eded .
the consequence are endless discussions between train transfer and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the end or space and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner takes up at the end time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also just on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional access numbers are not registered on the same distance are not registered .

on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken up to her core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , sat in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene in the bed of a Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , rented the rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone .
you stum@@ bled on a post of Yemen from the High School .
in just 18 years , the police killed an 18 year old child , and still is still on the road , called it was there .
confused , since nobody else did not pass on their feed the information , she decided to Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper in the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live .
he post a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s total body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is wild , &quot; thought out Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the death was nothing new for her and their community .
it also laid her mobile phone starting at the eve of Twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people , cried , and from a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , a sign with the inscription : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ her police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman , was a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ ish dog .
in another video , she said that another pol@@ ish is his army and cried , and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell at their statement .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us , and that we can call us . &quot;
at this moment I felt Schüt@@ t .
I was w@@ aking and wine . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home to the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she won her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house , and decided that the two will come to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in movie theaters from 11 .
it is a story of the survivors and of the protest , love and power , the strength and resistance force which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and the streets do not have to challenge answers .
when Fer@@ rell came with her daughter , a flower dress and a matching crown , after Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the two are talking about this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you are not only when I taught you , when I have to fight you , when black man must fight for that ? &quot; rec@@ alled to what they said . &quot;
&quot; we go to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that was not correct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened today is , is a highlight of the ... what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and brought it to it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we do to do to liber@@ ate free to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I had lucky enough to give you a experience of experience , where they don &apos;t experienced a ek@@ lat@@ ant Rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women .
I have the feeling , I would like to hold a bad service to hold them . &quot;
the first station when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , the South of Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , was at a camp site when activists come to the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there have been Fer@@ rell and her daughter with a local business owner , who made lunch .
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ves them to protest@@ ers .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August total , &quot; said she and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on Ess@@ ens @-@ Justice and health education in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organ . &quot;
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell passed during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to talk only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question was Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; you will be document or tried to find a history that you can take you ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ sis was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white , in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared : &quot; we had heard that people who are born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised up , their voices are not cent@@ red , and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , a artist from the field that is known for his activ@@ ism rum to To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his commitment , Fer@@ rell passed the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; this was the main thing to me how those people will be represented , because I will be presented . &quot;
the aim was to focus on Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not by the movement &quot; not around a Messi@@ ah guide , but to a community which comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most important participant in the film .
as a consequence , documents produced by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls life , how she loves and married her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and l@@ eighth when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I haven &apos;t understood that this work and in the case of human beings must have a certain vulner@@ ability . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls &apos;s history is repeated on the role of black sw@@ ung women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of movement , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; have been min@@ ted in social media , identify as fluctu@@ ul .
&quot; black , pregnant women in management positions have been carried out in the movement , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight at various fron@@ ts .
black , schw@@ ule women need to carry the main last of all . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted to notice that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it is noted that &quot; this is not a mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who called this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the fore@@ front front , because during a life at these cross@@ ings , as a black , schw@@ ule wife is so much on the game .
you can see their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news department store in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police exist .
Fer@@ rell is on the currency of a demonstration for 2 ½ years because of block@@ age of a demonstration on a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area , which she calls their home : &quot; an chaos . &quot;
nevertheless they cli@@ pped in a singing and she feels like this memory , ever since she went to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the road three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is to win our duty .
we will love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magnit@@ ude &quot; up to &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south @-@ country pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation 2009 , the population in advoc@@ acy and opponents .
cold leaves the topic hardly any .
the topic is also discussed in our Facebook page &quot; People and Bit@@ burg &quot; on our Facebook page .
while one of the bit gallery says : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; this would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ose ) or very simply : &quot; Or@@ w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while preparing to build a gallery more customers in the city , one of them also benefit from the rest of the other , the opponents , that the pedestrian zone will be ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ age .
in addition : the gallery is planned on the grounds of the property , in which the farmer &apos;s market hall is offering its products in 13 direct market .
at the beginning of the construction work will be conclusion .
the gallery M@@ acher would like to integrate a brand hall in the new building - namely to the Bed@@ a Square , to the outside sitting .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the Land@@ ing are always very pleased .
we have discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all , the gallery of the gallery has a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also a too .
above all the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; if the direct market receives in a brand hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of renting .
this should probably be too low in the new project , but probably not just too low . &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; our shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether gar@@ ment , shoes , dr@@ ink@@ age or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many shop@@ pers of stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but there is not even one of the upcoming weekly market , it is the more important that at least the market hall remains at least the market hall .
for this , the commodity is freshly made fresh , is also offered directly from the producers , and is also reasonably priced .
as you see , shop@@ pers will be able to use only from larger companies in a shopping sc@@ enter , because the people are not able for a retail@@ er often .
too bad , special shops are almost no longer and that is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a brand hall is not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the peas@@ antry thalle during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on time when the bit gallery is actually coming back sometime .
or it creates the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit Gallery previously , all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not work .
and a shopping center , that is empty , no one needs no one .
with my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market , it &apos;s why thanks to the w@@ ahn@@ t , thanks I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
if the peas@@ antry is broken , it will disappear again a piece of culture disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are on display - white , black and brown , that are almost invisible to the same - that are caused to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ators and Haar@@ mann , which have been sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analyst had a 35 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence after she made public diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition which opened on August 2 , is called A B@@ ecom@@ ing Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline had been transformed into technology , computer sciences and art . he was converted to condem@@ ning the condem@@ nation of Barack Obama , when he had just three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , and that if something with these gen@@ omic data could look like to be interpreted as they can be interpreted as they can be interpreted , and the in@@ harder detection of this interpret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has been spoken about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 due to 20 prosec@@ ut@@ ations , including six crimes against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison the prison was oppressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a liqu@@ eurs , black and white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly visible on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ ond Per@@ g - with whom it was associated with it .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of its 2012 @-@ Project &apos; strand &apos; .
in it , the artist &apos;s portraits are produced by stran@@ ger of art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette silent and chew@@ ing gum by using the DNA from the waste , to produce an image that could look like those people could look like these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from an newspaper magazine .
they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in jail and she wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared an press review in the exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t be visited this time , and she couldn &apos;t get photographed in this time , therefore , contact with Chelsea and asked them to make if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
in the course of two years , the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were exchanged during two years , several letters were exchanged during the course of two years .
they were even illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Co@@ mic &quot; Supp@@ oring images &quot; which saw a future fore@@ seen in the president of Chel@@ cias , and she was willing to see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings for seven thousand years in Kansas would be able to challenge a welcome kind of happy support .
even at the opening of the exhibition , Donald Tr@@ ump is a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government @-@ camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ eters to the star@@ ring spo@@ res , which he really fix , further too .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange Tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery &apos;s artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name ) an end of the &quot; Automatic sp@@ lit@@ le , &quot; whose basis is sex , race , sex and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mitochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a mil@@ lim@@ eter of Cs and Gs and As , are written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological ways we are all .
&quot; what people don &apos;t believe that our gen@@ ome is not because of our interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , can also be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell many different stories , so that &apos;s the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is one side mentioned above mentioned Co@@ mic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as it is mentioned in the hands of the disciplinary United States like King @-@ Hong Kong , as well as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they are talking about your speech , they have won them , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a letter from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who is from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still can still go to see if I speak . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it pre@@ dic@@ tive in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be greeted by their own gen@@ omic simulator , such as Hor@@ den of prot@@ ections .
it was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , who had been written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had it to the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human amount , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that feels like a mass movement that emerged with Chelsea , like the movement that are also behind her liberation . &quot;

a nationwide human @-@ hunt is ongoing for a professor at North@@ western University and a member of the University of Oxford who had been susp@@ ects as susp@@ ects after a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to his alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Chief of Cook County .

a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot;
the statement was added that War@@ ren@@ s colleagues had been sho@@ cked and had to him that he refused .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he needs the susp@@ ects to susp@@ ects the authorities .
&quot; the police has a presentation of her residence , and our efforts to strengthen them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said :
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to help the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building site of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a very sel@@ ection@@ able tip that happened in home 100@@ 8 something happened .

Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and Warren were included in the buildings .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza , published a statement in the residents &quot; : &quot; the police works at the time @-@ axle and the background of the O@@ pf@@ ers and research@@ ed a variety of mo@@ tive , including a possible domestic pre @-@ house . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in near future &quot; - the Russian Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of the implementation of the criteria the R@@ US@@ A@@ DA obtained the right to plan to plan and test with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM , on the second part of the travel schedule of the WA@@ DA , describes compliance with the Code which describes the criteria for the re@@ composition of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not give anything what to give the occasion for the occasion of the occasion .
everything was announced . &quot; everything was announced .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added he added .
one of the list @-@ mentioned criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of the German anti @-@ Dop@@ ing authorities , approved by the Canadian Richard McLaren by Canadian Richard McLaren for alleged state @-@ funded by the Russian Sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation by because our Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing System had a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no governmental programs , and we will not see what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ kos is voting with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
talking to the Russian sales office of R@@ Sports at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov received problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ Dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeated that the report has controversial positions and regulations .
no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov was added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was impossible in November 2015 as part of the Dop@@ ing @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
it was allowed to plan to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the organization of the Organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself &quot; into the right direction &quot; moves to be used again .

the Start @-@ U@@ ps , which will help to help your company not to be the next u@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ rett wanted to measure your employees in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls can &apos;t work .
answers often were often v@@ age , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you persec@@ uting An@@ onymous spoke , sad some workers in the process not .
there were never been consistency and lenses , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
it has compiled people from the outside .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is to help out the company to find out how their employees feel at home .
by creating and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of employees , it enables to offer , surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ cker allow C @-@ suite executives to avoid them directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you have now tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software Analytics tools used to measure commitment .
Er@@ rett said that they have a better insight into what makes your employees remember and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a high heat map of the company that have the most complaints and which managers have low support results - so that you can download , why .
companies come to see that at the fore@@ head of workplace culture , you don &apos;t have to have the next u@@ ber that has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , which describes a environment of Bel@@ ief together , where those who have spoken have been pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18,@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the final technical site Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour , looked at increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year , in the heart of the u@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ t has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ tible , customized &quot; Pul@@ s- , &quot; allows confidence , confi@@ dential answers to real @-@ time and the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line , with the employees of bad behavior .
and if the main leader is included , complaints confirmed directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulations , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent , said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that its employees are po@@ or@@ ly treated or is un@@ ethical , it can be tast@@ ed consequences through consumers @-@ Bo@@ yk@@ ott , Workers &quot; Flu@@ id and Kl@@ agen , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ ts for more than one year to ensure that employees are related to politics and methods , and have a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
earlier if an employee wanted to sign a problem , he had to find a number of telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , formal and hope that it was seriously taken .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , as the company conver@@ ts to use problems , problems of leadership forces , who were sitting in offices in cities or countries , were hidden - like discrimination , Bel@@ et@@ ching or un@@ spo@@ iled intern@@ ment and can be used .
&quot; I can closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management of Ruby from Ruby .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment and legal consequences . &quot;
companies started to take ethics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out because of eth@@ eric @-@ sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took us until the &quot; Soci@@ ale media has come to their right &quot; to prevent companies that you did not prevent their dirty welcome online .
&quot; before using technology on the monitoring of ethics , human hope used as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent are offering your software as service as the service , and the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that the approval of venture capital investors will have to support both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ ts received $ 10 million for the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , bringing the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investment will hardly be surprising , in view of the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research , that shows today &apos;s staff of their jobs more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries are older and interesting projects only .
employees want to feel that you will be accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if the people are glad to do in a company that will make it worth@@ while to do this company , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
fe@@ eder returns , if their portfolio will run good . companies run good , if employees are engaged , and are engaged .
if the Analytics tools will promise third promise , commitment and use of employees , it is not a wonder that you will find support .
the data on the experts of workplace culture is important to the experts of workplace culture .
but the data is usable , if the implementation of a company does not take action .
indeed , if a company employees ask for your feedback , it can be anticip@@ ation that change in the way is .
and if the change does not occur enough , or not at all , this is a dis@@ appointment and staff .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 talks , you have to have ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have left themselves on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; Have you really heard me ?
please take care of this ?
and if you are not to take care of why I should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now leads about monthly employees , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is about G@@ lin@@ t reports , so Er@@ rett .
and following the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees it was driven by the speed of the decision to organize several teams within the company &apos;s decision to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby , the company receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that on a long point of view , this is known for a better bond of working workers in an industry , known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removed the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins

players who are registered to summer courses are allowed to return to summer courses after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 at the water man Football Center .
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a &quot; was shortly before Tuesday .
N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 PM , to meet the already full @-@ packed time of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , where the Bru@@ ins had moved almost one week after the final season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in western wood .
they should stick in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he ple@@ x@@ ed the control change in N@@ CA@@ A , even if they were able to add a further point of routes .
&quot; we put these enormous loads of three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply have taken , it is possible to keep them , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come up to Saturday and we have time more time , it will really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices , as soon as the camp &apos;s clear lines of its fields , adjacent to the adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of hosted class , which is already subject to a foot@@ path behind a tor@@ ch , not to be a slight task .
Bru@@ ins @-@ player should take the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a grants a problem that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free of the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; that is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far away to think that the people rent there in a room and then set up there to set a exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and from a exercise , it is a rather good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best to do with what we have .
I do not make that too large wor@@ ries .
we have a plan . &quot;

creation of a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video at a squee@@ ze music video and was an gor@@ ges for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 @-@ ies .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ari@@ ous Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a fore@@ love for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from Yemen , which has been dead for over 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ aker .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covered the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who illustrated in Scot@@ ney - Isaac steering iewicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly .
&quot; I have just written on the thum@@ b of a letter on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ soldier in the 1700 @-@ 90s , who worked for the Jak@@ ob@@ ab , &quot; he says .
&quot; that is his thum@@ b pressure !
and there is always smoke to smoke , because at that time , it was a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he would be too .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who has been defeated by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , he lived and nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have given my welcome gru@@ dge a little , &quot; ) it seems to be beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ anic &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ onu@@ cli@@ cks on walls and the bottles who had spent centuries in gra@@ bs .
he emi@@ grated through the premises and the ruins of the old castle , and said with Land@@ scape , fermentation , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des began one decade later , the workers began to take care of the archive in order to take care of the archive as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ ok@@ rates said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
ta@@ vern@@ s , Let@@ ters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , cards , which had said , &quot; you could be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to fight two families .
guys , let &apos;s all his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point for the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who is a man to join the newly built castle to join the peas@@ antry of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a w@@ rist@@ watch , who entered 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ ost family of Kent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
the peas@@ antry started in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start .
may the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are fixed in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , the story of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s history , the family Dar@@ rell lasted seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , which he filled with stones with stones ( a discovery that was only a few years later when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Per@@ re@@ lls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ leman &apos;s chic Ga@@ un@@ er , will always make debt to make debt and money for things that they couldn &apos;t make .
other generations of Dar@@ rell forms in their school@@ ing , by paying many old women - I am against me as a he@@ ap @-@ in @-@ looking guys , with a talent to be land@@ locked in land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of its application in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write @-@ experiences
he has spent a two week stay in Finnish game for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ gl@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ called back to nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I must be finished with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
starting : over 300 years old mari@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered over 300 years old .
with the hil@@ ll@@ ung of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old mari@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( round @-@ tour of Thursday ) .
Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team would like to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz logo and its slogan at Nelson Ar@@ tz .
by the end of August it is supposed to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the promotion since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it to their yesterday registered website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clearly too much , it seems better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
with the promotion , it will be more than one logo and a slogan , it continues to continue .
&quot; it is valid to form@@ ulate an all @-@ off promise of form@@ ulate , one which gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot;
finally , she was standing in competition with other communities .
a mid @-@ digit amount is the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f &apos;s new roof brand and the campaign cost .
military forms in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara , in Ankara , the Supreme military council ( Y@@ as ) through pen@@ sions and retirement in the army corps .
this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of the general staff , as previously , but in the office of the prime minister .
among the consult@@ ations , under the presidency of the government , now also the five Vice President and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
so they were civilians in Y@@ as in the over@@ sight .
the government moves to the bre@@ gel in the military .
general staff of the Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force , and the navy were de@@ emed .
since the failed Cou@@ p , Head of Erdo@@ gan 169 of 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and j@@ ob@@ le .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the exile of Ex@@ hi@@ ul@@ lah Fig@@ ures , the Erdo@@ gan as a wi@@ zard of the put@@ sch@@ ity .
against 4@@ 86 people , who had been involved directly on the coup attempt , will take part in Ankara in Ankara .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan attempted to be referred to as a &quot; religious @-@ gift &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan of the army really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; H@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
the general staff will give it to an increasing &quot; Islamic &quot; of the Army , which led among other things in re@@ vocation of the head office for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
the large @-@ scale work at the Army and the Security Council continues in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan of Dec@@ ree further 73@@ 95 State of the Feu@@ ver , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
seemed it seemed to be the military .
general gener@@ als earlier than the actual gent@@ le@@ men of the country .
three times more than calling on their role as a guard of the world citizen .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan of the military had returned to step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erdo@@ gan run targets a Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
in particular , in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly @-@ called officer who sought to death from fear of persecution in foreign political asylum , the Turkish army would be a few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ist .
meets , one such development could not leave the Nato .
there are in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of doubts about the Turkish Army in the Alliance .
the leadership structures and oper@@ ation@@ abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to modify the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .

the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will save poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the United States , as well as the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will replace the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to good , the candidates speak English to support the financial means to support himself and knowledge that will come from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate on the race in the middle course of the race .
again , over the past few months ago , over the future of the Renn@@ sh@@ utt@@ les have been cont@@ ested , it is now easy to go fast .
even before the end of the year , at the beginning of the year , on which the tourist ride will be built .
to secure the future of the race in the mid @-@ term office in the long term , according to the traffic Ministry of Transport , will begin construction work at the circuit .
&quot; with the decision to order the Ilmen@@ au race of Ilmen@@ au race on the track and to renov@@ ate the country , the country has been crucial for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Traffic Secretary of Klaus Sü@@ hl declared on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route he climbed to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on its basis the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country to be present at the moment .
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen train as the operator are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this will be the road@@ map , which were applied to vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; said Sü@@ hl .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Bahn@@ Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus that the race @-@ sti@@ g shuttle can be ordered to be ordered in December 2017 .
the race @-@ shuttle shuttle is one of the popular railway link between Ilmen@@ au and Renn@@ es .
in the past months , during a pilot @-@ run company , whether the distance of sufficient people is used to order them back in future again .
the track is also strong in parts of the cultivation .
the ascent of sex robots is real , and we should be wor@@ ries
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy that 2017 is a new report about the technological development in the area of sex robot .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tik and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ eli@@ d of the robot , the form of chest , and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; the people make fun over her , but the companies offer lots of it , and we will get much more frequently in more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have been developed by their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a silicone , that feels warm - with respect to human reactions , that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
users can also select his robot as well as in accordance with its balance , &quot; to select all the ey@@ eli@@ ers of the robot through the shape of the chest , until the type , or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still wor@@ rying , as many robot that have &quot; personalities , &quot; that would like to look back a Step@@ ford &apos;s woman .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have been developed to robot with a silicon con@@ vent .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adjust its robot to the characteristics that they can find themselves , for example .
and then there is the Ro@@ bot &apos;s Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of rel@@ ap@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who is due to your personality , as well as possible , &quot; is heated the website of True Compani@@ on .
so what you like to do you like and they do not like what you do not like , etc .
it has , during the course of the day , they also have their vocal - quite like real people !
they may not be tired to be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation , or they may be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
there are many un@@ favorable aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the sub@@ stit@@ uting female properties , that if you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , not calm one on most of them .
on his website , True Compani@@ on Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why can males then do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the site .
however , these sex robot not only have a feedback or content just a different sex game .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ esse on a bit dark@@ er and t@@ ying it in our culture , to a retreat of the ideal gender equality of the sexes , to a desire for sex with sub@@ missions than optional .
most men are of course no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R will hold its rising popularity , but they still remain at the edge of consumer goods .
but what out of the mar@@ ry zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very in@@ structive .
and many people are not strange or bel@@ lows , until them the free market gives the permission to use .
there is a certain overview that these highly developed sex robot in a time appears to be threatened in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House which has been threatened to have women sexually mature , women are sexually mature .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ le &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ oured body and the stolen eyes , but as realistic these vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robot is to be a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as technically realistic such as technically possible ( even with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
her salvation would like to recognize that they were human being the movement of a real body .
but , on the spot , when it comes to the point when it goes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot does not matter real women .
you cannot go from their companion or simply walk away .
they have no communication or background history , nothing , which could indicate independence or anything , what the imag@@ inations of tot@@ ality could be interference .
differently : they are f@@ ake slaves .
or to press this in the expression of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human Son ...
it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ h@@ ish@@ eit of the Tr@@ unk era that the political donation which have pol@@ arized the US elect@@ ors , also have families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest were made in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to avoid using the horror of Tr@@ uman &apos;s relatives .
we have rigor@@ ous all of us to use our filter bub@@ bles .
the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es together .
I mentioned this because my cousin , a left @-@ left Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago , has lived and worked for a long time with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York .
you reminded me that the unit can have a mighty effect on a common enemy .
with Tr@@ unk sitting in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relatives , with whom they had fought decades because of the policy , suddenly , suddenly and all times on the same side .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this is also significant risks involved .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ unk , but the effect of his presidency has the power to move all to the right .
if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that us will no longer run out of a day .
however , there is still a sc@@ atter@@ er long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which appear once compared to its standards it suddenly appear as an ep@@ it@@ elling of verses .
I find me today of a active nostal@@ gia in the car@@ p , which 14 % income tax ( but at least , we did how his tax declaration looked ) - which both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact is a very mil@@ de stra@@ tified .
if Tr@@ unk goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritual , to qualify as a im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin came in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you have no caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously great , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ y and the animals are turning to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and clim@@ atic music conve@@ ys this strange way .
so many cl@@ ashes of a city : the views of high buildings will become old , the sky@@ line will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not able to meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Car@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience because two two @-@ year @-@ old age , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on and all have a great time .
if I would like to use the Kar@@ us@@ el , I would have given him a full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked him required .
on the other hand , I was forced into a purchase house in a department store , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could break my credit card .
the coffee house on the corner of my street is the same as the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip at the same - this to buy a little about the table at the table .
this doesn &apos;t get only to the slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also makes pressure on the server in order to bring personality in a situation in which no required is required .
the poor woman fell in the department store , while I tired the experience made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from the prison in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his hand in the hospital , the prison authorities , according to a fall in his cell .
pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted for murder after a appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence .
he was a Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the day of 2013 by putting them several times by a door of the toilets in his house in Pret@@ oria in his home .
pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girl@@ friend for a cheer@@ ful in@@ sist@@ ling , who hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the 6 @-@ year @-@ old prison sentence of pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say to be very dense .
the National Prosecutor of the Prosecutor said that she shall come to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be seen in this year .
pist@@ ori@@ us is danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .

software update for diesel cars : what do for the benefit now need
how exactly the software update will be held ?
need diesel driver to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in the overview .
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software will be offered for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are except of them except .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine of the ACE Auto Club Europa is inv@@ alu@@ able :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the actual software updates are voluntarily .
&quot; the obligatory updates before they are valid only for vehicles , the Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
their dis@@ arm@@ ament has ordered the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when , customers are informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have a rapid implementation in the next few months , but still does not have any exact date .
Daimler has informed informed of every person for every person .
if the inspection is due to an inspection , this will be done in their frame .
how long the change had come in total ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
provisions are from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , sur@@ rendered to the Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers on the topic of the environment . &quot;
how long should last the update ?
the re@@ arm@@ ament itself could last only three to four hours .
time @-@ time could be to get an appointment .
what would make car that drive no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is waiting for .
presumably foreign manufacturers would be tra@@ ced , so S@@ met@@ an@@ ine .
is a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE should be fears .
but in the regions , where you are dro@@ pping .
in rural areas , there are no value losses for older diesel .
the ACE is to wait with a selling for sale .

we make the City of life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ achs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to celebrate the next year in R@@ ente .
the place is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are but ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker &apos;s urban builders .
and the work makes it still big fun as he conve@@ ys in the press conference .
he reports for varied , but also challenging tasks that wait for its successor .
at the same time , surprised him that so far no candidates had the requirement profile .
the city is looking for the next time a architects or engineer .
this is to be said - in attention of the regular termin@@ ation freeze - enough time for a preparation .
since Has@@ lach has been responsible for the administrative community as sub@@ ordin@@ ated construction authority , the applic@@ ants must be prec@@ eded by appropriate lines .
because this function wants to retain the city to any case .
if it would not fill out this no longer , would have to drive out the citizens of consultation to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity of the city and him himself is important , &quot; W@@ acker who reported from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens .
for more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated over the W@@ acker with pride and look back .
&quot; we do the city of life , &quot; he is over the building office and its employees .
but also in the future there are varied projects at the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park parking lot .
the cinema bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter is last updated with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all great tasks on my successor .
work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ ure has been present for a urban development of big playing space .
with Has@@ l@@ achs &apos;s own building yard and Gär@@ t@@ ner@@ ei could be flexible to frequent .
you can move much , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green plants will be mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye that fits &quot; if new buildings will be approved , emphas@@ ises the formation of the city .
the city @-@ maker is high responsibility .
the builder , &quot; at the end , everything goes through my table . &quot;
at the time of care and coordination , he can count on his long@@ time staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been around for 15 years .
also that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker said : &quot; we are looking for someone who were really identified with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to thank Roland W@@ acker who wants to be able to introduce a closed studies as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor , and is also able to have a specialised knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the municipal office of urban planning and civil engineering , construction planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ able , administration of urban property , urban engine with building yard and urban bodies , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines were thrown : southern path closed
according to police , previously unknown , the Blue bike made by the railway station on the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) were thrown onto the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ert@@ ure had to be needed .
the investig@@ ators are from two male cub@@ s and are searching for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ort , the witnesses of a ros@@ ot@@ oter and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , for AP@@ A .
the or the perpet@@ rators have brought itself in great danger , even in the train traffic .
next to the damage on the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as the late @-@ minute drive and costs for the rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ s from the train could be on to the perpet@@ rators .
in total , it was a total of &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities .
just ten persons , Friday morning , two of which concerned the remote traffic .
they didn &apos;t exist , however , they had to delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres can be replaced .
Isol@@ ators and Ma@@ sten were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your di@@ gestive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study claimed exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the inc@@ ur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 , caused by stomach cra@@ cking , and bub@@ ble , recur@@ ring or blood flow , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the people normally use , meat and dairy products , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid of tr@@ yp@@ oph@@ an of proteins were to develop immune cells that promote immune cells to promote immune cells .
the lead expl@@ orer , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ organisms who are hidden in food , not in the body .
cells , which are im@@ min@@ ated , inflamm@@ ations , are derived from cells that promote tolerance and body protect , without sensitive tissues .
if the balance goes far away in the direction of inflammation , it may result of inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance immun@@ ological cell was found in mice that bear a certain bacter@@ ium in their deposits .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus re@@ uter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance , manufactured .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an , the mice in their food , the more had made them from these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. re@@ uter@@ i and an tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of rich diet toler@@ ate , less inflammatory cy@@ mb@@ eus promotes the same system even with people .
the post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ man in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immun@@ ological findings but found out that a group of academic powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separated , but it was not separated .
it believed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ds of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were examined DNA sequ@@ enced , and it were six bacter@@ ici@@ aries that were present in mice with the immuno@@ therapy , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were infected in a steril@@ en environment , so that they were not developed by the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they were not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. re@@ uter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria could grow to the immune system , the researchers L. re@@ uter@@ i left in a liquid and over@@ led small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - due to the immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
the active component of the liquid was cleaned out , proved to be a tribut@@ ary of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an metast@@ ases , which is known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers needed the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values hal@@ ved , the number of cells fell by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and protect the most of us L. re@@ uter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known to whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an out@@ set products from L. re@@ uter@@ i the cells can develop as in mice , but def@@ ective in relation to the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an relationship with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote inflammation of inflammatory effect on the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms .
potentially , high level of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values to present in the presence of L. re@@ uter@@ i to an expansion of these population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with Nem@@ anja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; by Nem@@ anja M@@ atic , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Under @-@ Cup against Real Madrid starts , and impressive in the heart role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira were mar@@ ched after exposure .
matic was still impossible from the preparation of Asia @-@ tour of blues and made only 45 minutes , that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had to improve from the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way , how he think it is football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready to be ready . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , as Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho is his Start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho revealed three more new regi@@ sters , but he insi@@ sted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic work , &quot; three of its four priority re@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; three of four you get to get the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added to the association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will be happy when they get four of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the Sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
Seattle were out of Seattle in the US state of Washington , the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ state Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the wheel@@ base it was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was an car@@ dio test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising early as early as early as early as early as early as early as early as early as early as early
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new Low@@ land for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
like the wind is shooting : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD head , good @-@ democra@@ t prime minister on elections are always with a certain concern in Berlin .
only none of stor@@ ks from the party centre , just no counter@@ wind from the covenant - that is the most important desire of the election .
the party has been the party since Martin Schulz , has changed considerably .
since then , the employees out of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House and growing the events in the SPD @-@ regi@@ strations are the same capit@@ als .
what has been there since the beginning of the year , would be described with counter@@ wind no time in the approach .
it was deep @-@ deser@@ ters .
and one after the other .
the League @-@ CD@@ U sees the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows even more : red @-@ green , simply not essential to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , editor of the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising leader in the Green ME@@ Ps participated in a Green ME@@ Ps in the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the landing elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens President Michael wa@@ ner gave the ab@@ u@@ ge in Saxony @-@ Saxony @-@ MP El@@ ke Twe@@ ak to return to her mandate .
the excess to CD@@ U is a clear failure of the vot@@ ers .
El@@ ke Twe@@ sten immediately return to the mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and elect@@ oral campaign of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; that may not be true , &quot; do not be true , &quot; do a SPD and war@@ rior , when on Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message will reach the party headquarters .
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands under the over@@ lap of the green ME@@ Ps Twe@@ ak to CD@@ U without their own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in the SPD region .
no one knows what the next comes .
the missions began with the un@@ expect@@ able defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more believ@@ able , the com@@ rades have at the time .
after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was it even though it was so much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ m@@ els , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party smoothly .
ar@@ ous@@ ed down the com@@ rades in the weeks afterwards again .
then , when they had exhau@@ sted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next underground .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last member of the SPD executive , lost his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his town .
and because he did so wrong to crisis communication , then rather everything was wrong , what you can get wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so even Stephan W@@ eil even now .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas rec@@ ary and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony Prime Minister , had already been successful in criticism .
there was also been added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , W@@ eil tried to set stronger , in the League acc@@ ents in the past weeks .
the effort by the former Mayor of Hanover , Germany &apos;s efforts to expand his power in Berlin , also experienced com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they left him as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now , the exact opposite .
thereby , W@@ eil meets the party of this year , the low @-@ Saxon Green Party did not fall guil@@ t .
and there already doesn &apos;t even exist .
in one hour time , com@@ rades have to be shut down in their own rows .
her wrath is turned on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the ab@@ u@@ ge Par@@ ari@@ sts .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and ob@@ sol@@ ation , as wife Twe@@ ak their own career processes , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD Bundestag ( R@@ ND ) , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. Twe@@ ak is not because of their individual as a direct candidate , but above the national parliament of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in Parliament , the lower @-@ Saxon economy continues .
the logical consequence , it would be back to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Executive Committee , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeuvre . &quot;
four years ago , &quot; the elect@@ orate before four years ago , &quot; says Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the general election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U &apos;s elect@@ oral candidates , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann continued .
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there have been more or more and further commit@@ ments from CD@@ U Lower Saxony has been given .
funds for Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his years in the years to get support from the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of urban development on Wednesday Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler still gave a look back to the date .
since 1991 it has been in sens@@ ations re@@ organisation .
back then , in the reconstruction of the I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken up two thirds of funding .
in the reconstruction of II from 2005 to 2016 , the allow@@ ance was still at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler are the previous reconstruction of a &quot; Succ@@ ess@@ ful project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the internal development , and not only complete new building areas .
on 4 April , you will receive the information from the Regi@@ stra@@ tion@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe for the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the total amount of 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which are 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community .
how is now a re@@ organisation area ?
man will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler further , examine , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it is also a role , whether in the planned area of all the present in the planned area .
this may also be postp@@ oned to postp@@ one the territory limit again again .
the St@@ eg arrived on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the federal states &quot; Social City , &quot; which will then be carried out in the framework .
the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of inner city , improving the residential and working conditions and receipt of infrastructure .
the measures would be related , that is , per plot .
the refurb@@ ishment area would then be set to set as stat@@ utes .
the consent period for funding is running since 1 January 2017 until April 30 , 2017 .
however , up to September this year , however , it would only be carried out at once , as part of those dealing with a questionnaire to fill up a questionnaire .
in November or December , if the stat@@ ute of the stat@@ utes will begin to begin with the re@@ actors in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every municipality had to have had to look their own prec@@ ab studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the urban di@@ ps on this site and decide when restoration is being refurb@@ ished and in which extent can be refurb@@ ished .
it will also be registered for the respective property as well as a sani@@ ti@@ bility in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again after sens@@ ations and make a picture of the location .
Got@@ zel stressed that a significant success factor for the project would be the co @-@ effect of the enterprise .
therefore we will give a fra@@ grant to citizens who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled with up to the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and basic version , &quot; where it is among other things , among others , among other things and re@@ constructions .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can be made up to size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area .
the blue &quot; Betriebs@@ bogen &quot; can only be used when the buildings will be operated .
however , it is aware that Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire do not have a motion at the same time .
new construction measures are not im@@ mobili@@ zed .
Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funding after the &quot; Wind@@ @-@ dog prin@@ zip &quot; functional - who first comes , meal at first .
you could not be able to reserve any funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present &quot; tasty &quot; to be tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor , itself a micro@@ chip itself , to come with a hand@@ motion in the house and car .
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so he entered his door@@ step to open his office and even with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ land , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and hand @-@ har@@ assed and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to support her life with technology through its firm Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has accompanied by Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisor to the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out after medical standard .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to modify the castles along houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 a castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands .
the decision to fly the White House , a marine helicopter to South La@@ wn in the last month , which will cost tax pay@@ ers according to the figures of the military that was left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President on board is on board , the heart of the event was held on July 17 at the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and management officials of the White House made a round tour of products from all 50 states .
in Connecticut , helicop@@ ters was built in Connecticut in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ arms from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .
the White House of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , after the helicopter of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the lifting of helicop@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to be aware , because there is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 &quot; on the eve of the event dedicated to the Deputy Commander of the aviation sector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news revealed that the helicopter was met at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 a.m. , and so long stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 will be cleared out this night .
note note that if the flight departed from the White House should be delayed due to the restri@@ ction of the animals a second team would be required for the flight .
the original air@@ flow was during the event during the helicopter , while the security sper@@ son@@ al remained the unit during the time on the floor at the plane .
out of the TIM@@ E &apos; disposal , it wasn &apos;t clear whether a second flight must be required .
the Hatch Act also offers the Federal Government to use state @-@ owned property for political purposes .
data records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question that we created , was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
it sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President announced that the reform was approved for the reform of healthcare , which was ongoing in the Senate , and he was re@@ acting the efforts to force the government &apos;s efforts .
the use of the flight line , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
as a survey carried out in February an investigation as the Presi@@ dential aircraft in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of mel@@ ts that uses its predecessor to its predecessor .
the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 @-@ fish , often lead training flights to Washington and South La@@ wn in the White House in order to increase the US President at the White House with precise centi@@ metres .
as Tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 conducted an White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event took place at the training requirement for the month , a civil war said .
hel@@ ium @-@ units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commissions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have made the burden on any of the other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company has not been involved in the re@@ porter at the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no budget for the Presi@@ dential flights , and it &apos;s hard to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ sts of the U.S. Department of Defense for the financial year 2017 , the Do@@ D ratio is based on the V@@ H @-@ 3D , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
notes of a flight in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia in a 30 minutes from the home of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility for a 30 @-@ minute flight .
the White House argued that the actual cost of helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of the estimates of estimates , is highly mis@@ leading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this estimates include personal , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the supplement for Do@@ D is not the number of personnel , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time , the former press pre@@ ference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ins , announced the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week of things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ins .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I expect hundreds of them , if not even thousands of people depend on . &quot;
and I think as most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate , that particular note . &quot;
it was not clear whether tr@@ ump with helicop@@ ters , as he created his tour of the South La@@ wn to the Event , but he set into the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ arms .
at the White House , Tr@@ uman &apos;s representative of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ epherd with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss ahead of a challenging task
the leader in the second tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga occurs at the table @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will be tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel from the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite after five games , the leader of the Second World Cup League won the meaning for the reality of the Second World Cup .
team boss Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has a lot of respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for a class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their D@@ ane and Finn@@ s can refer to the Davis Cup in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strongly in double &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will always be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there you need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ ers Club for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could be set up .
it is currently playing the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella , not to become the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , which will be playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) to his first use in this season .
the so far un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vasi@@ lev@@ ski on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ b@@ üh@@ el .

re@@ wards on the role : the city provides 46 kitchen help .
the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an order to the team .
in the urban Children &apos;s Day , the clock is returned .
as of 1 September , the city of Krefeld will take over the city of Ess@@ ence in the urban care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , the head of the field of youth help , is the good news : &quot; we have all very pleased . &quot;
in the house , out of the house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh cruci@@ ally .
the city runs in the area of 46 children &apos;s day@@ care centres , in 44 , the children for lunch time have a warm meal .
in the last kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile not only children , the 45 week can be taken care , in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service , when children up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 locations from the 1st of September kitchen service : you warm the delivered food , add them to salad , Roh@@ k@@ ost and fruit , por@@ tioned meal , give the meal , give the food from , rin@@ se , and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees will be assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ed also like se@@ eng@@ ined facilities - decides on the hour@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen @-@ hel@@ pers are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger and it is easier to implement the K@@ ital@@ ism easier , ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because this is why it &apos;s why it is a healthy diet and cook@@ ery classes .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force was not sensible .
also for children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - has so far been the task of the kitchen forces - will be released by special cleaning machines .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also provided the charm for the city as well as the charm of quality and foreign currency for the city than the economic situation , that it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 particip@@ ations are set up .
&quot; but these hours fall under approximately 750 people at the legal entity even so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

G@@ MB @-@ owner &apos;s investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union was looking for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie through the long @-@ term commitment to the production in Glasgow at the production of Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said , the company founded the future of investments on the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products plan@@ ing and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added , added that employees and trade union representatives would be known as &quot; first , &quot; when their activities would change their activities .
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ iter of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s onto &quot; concern , &quot; concerns the financing for the moderni@@ zation of production line . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organi@@ zer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain clarity from General @-@ Site Manager no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members can deeply deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the labour force focused on the local community and the large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in a field with high unemployment and social matters .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the Lohn@@ s and welfare board , and before the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the Eastern Europe cost and the chronic production response , the Eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently require a fl@@ ori@@ ating production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokesperson for Pla@@ yers said : &quot; the Fili@@ pe near T@@ oll@@ cross has got a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will react directly to it because we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
we had two months ago a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we are like all companies that are highly competitive and in@@ highly competitive economic and non @-@ secure economic climate , our stores are constantly check - and this applies for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
in addition to : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operative improvements .
we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a manufacturing facility and all of which are to change our business processes at the location , and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
last three years ago , the PS@@ G Barcelona had warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La League like her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti ber@@ eu@@ en
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not let us down@@ ward in their persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar , after they dis@@ solve a offer of £ 189 million in order to dis@@ solve his free Wi @-@ Fi , but they warned us just three years ago in front of the world .
the sensational approach is heated to the summer season , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after dis@@ termin@@ ation , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is w@@ right over the way , as Ne@@ ym@@ ar has abandoned its way to the outside of the Catalan Council , although the club has always been given to his best , to take care of him since its arrival in 2013 .
but the football world was warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 had interested interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that if they are touch one of our players , we will get in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we resp@@ ects all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if they try to sign one of our players , they will sign the consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer is interested in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not be able to travel to the International Criminal Tribunal for any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to save the consequences of this interest because they lost one of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the abuse of Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael H@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse of the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further for discussions .
Christian Cher@@ ry , spokesman of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; published by the former Rain@@ s@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be the top of the Catholic Church very serve when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would put their deepest on their own branches or their then false assessment of pre@@ operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ecting violence during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ lei levels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the tac@@ kl@@ ess of Regensburg @-@ two f@@ le no one knows that it would be prevented in order to be prevented , but con@@ spic@@ uous , however , con@@ spic@@ uous , however , con@@ spic@@ uous , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ e@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the usual , the Catholic Church as a source of all exercise , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that is preparing for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
the princ@@ ess of Thur@@ n and Tax@@ is also said in the interview with the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we love to the church and that is a change of Fres@@ sen . &quot;
in addition , it pointed out that in its youth @-@ bats a very normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; have been &quot; to have been finished , &quot; to be done with fre@@ chen children , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot;
for example , they seem to apply - today set the standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse , often Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared in connection with the reports .
completely to un@@ quite , author and historian Michael Ez@@ emann spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s memor@@ andum for &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he will demonstrate the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s exactly what is in the 440 page report , which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ se Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 rainf@@ alls had been identified between 1945 and early 1990 &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility , &quot; victim of access , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ uses .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , Germany : &quot; in summary , the fact that the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
just in high emotional effects , the vis@@ itation could be tri@@ mmed for the pupils .
nevertheless , in contrast to many other susp@@ ects that many victims were inv@@ alu@@ able by R. estim@@ ations and therefore in many cases , despite violence even had positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , why the final report for the abuse of the Rain@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence in the rainforest . &quot; there is a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for an increase of many students &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfection@@ ist , who was handy of the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance .
how to be the Bi@@ ograph this final report ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : if one reads all the effort and all 440 pages long report from front to the back , you have to ask , why the name is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at all in it .
it is just eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of complic@@ ation or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the violence at the pre @-@ school events occurred outside of the capital .
you can see it in the case for him , or first of these things , not seriously .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ar gramm@@ ar school , which he was involved in virtually all those surve@@ yed - as liter@@ ating - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; sky , &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
for instance , the broad majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent witness , &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; comprehen@@ sible teacher , who guys regularly performed regularly with cakes , cookies as well as Bon@@ b@@ bons , and always led by children of children .
only a minority was worth over his perfection@@ ism and its high emotional effects , which led to W@@ ut@@ ches already in time .
that he didn &apos;t get only with chairs and the key federation on the ground , but also ear@@ ing , too , cried to the hair or ears , he has given himself up even more years ago , deeply wor@@ sen@@ ed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
in his honorary situation , however , it must be said that such education methods have been in the fragile time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely distributed , parents like with teachers .
do you know yet such tra@@ ch@@ tig@@ ational methods ?
of course , I think of us who was born in 1968 .
also I have experienced in a world school , a state high school .
compared to what is actually in this report , the cause sexual abuse and the violence on the school , are the free b@@ at@@ ellen .
because we ask , whether it is not rather with his friend and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI , so many media has just reduced to him on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , yes , many who never understood it , still freezing .
the truth however is : the report was Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every sense !
in connection with the report , the report was reported much about the subject of mis@@ use in the Rain@@ s@@ burgs cathedral .
George R@@ atz@@ inger is also present in the final report to any problems or co @-@ knowledge with respect to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victim of sexual violence claims to have been entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never stopped to speak with my father , or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said to speak for the other , &quot; It was all very p@@ ein@@ ated . &quot;
the true problem with the ligh@@ tening of sexual abuse was , however , it is that most of the victims from Sch@@ am .
if they didn &apos;t trust her parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , they were definitely not a ch@@ oral manager , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how this is what the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in respect to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a frag@@ mentary student stated that : &quot; concerning sexual abuse , I see no case in which he had said before ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had legal knowledge and could have seen the respective perpet@@ rators .
I keep it ... also for really absurd to take you that ... Bub@@ en ha@@ unting or clear or more recently opened , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , confi@@ denti@@ ality , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - More ... &quot;
thus the report on the whole result is clear : &quot; that in advance of affected students and / or their environment , the environment was not confirmed in the framework of the study . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus fre@@ ed by every co @-@ knowledge .
so , it may not be charged with him , not to prevent him or to display .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name with these rebel@@ li@@ ous crimes in connection as it happened in some cases .
in the media it was much of &quot; violence against &quot; in the rainy burger cathedral .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of a report on the report of the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
must be living with this privil@@ ege ?
Michael H@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that in the reporting it is missing , and it became a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , anywhere , in the midst of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
however , this is a abuse of the report .
there is clean separated : between the school and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , we say it once , rest of the rest .
in addition , the report &apos;s inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral member of the domain .
the whole live inspection @-@ ped@@ ago@@ gy of cases , in which boys were chi@@ pped and painted , and killed amongst them , all of them on the school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous economy have to have to have .
but in fact , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when she had already been at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ar gramm@@ ar school .
at the same time , like the very witnesses , the topic &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to come to its and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise @-@ paradise . &quot;
what was contrary to the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : because of the discipline was already a discipline , but not a sa@@ c violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims of the general humanity by R. carried out and therefore in many cases , despite violence even have a positive memories with him . &quot;
so at the same time remains the privil@@ ege to have gone away .
however , despite all efforts , the report was allowed only to define two periods in which it was reported on the school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and from the predecessors of a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again , around 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger completed his ears in front of the listeners ?
Michael H@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um director , which was even reproduced in 1989 .
it shows that it suggests that in the school , the testing is still practic@@ ed in the school . &quot;
already in light of the risk of negative presses , he would be urgent .
that was of course at a time when legal clarity was also forbidden in Bavaria as a testing and had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that it occurred in a legal grey area , like everyone of us still knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate the people of maybe , or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say it , he would have been sho@@ cked away .
this is simply not easy .
the testing was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria and officially was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n and Tax@@ is claimed that it would be too bad today to turn the standards for the time .
how do you see what ?
Michael H@@ emann : we speak about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of the An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of having to evaluate the past of today moral periods .
since the princ@@ ess already has been quite right .
but this is of course not valid for sexual abuse , who was in@@ scri@@ bed in all times and also not for what happened in the school of resistance and violence at un@@ school children , this goes far beyond the back then .
this is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
but at the same time , I need George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all these had nothing to do with him .
his funds to the disciplinary committee and punishment , so ear@@ es and ears on the hair and ears , were widely distributed in the 1970s .
then , he was forbidden as a physical activity , he has also passed away .
what is the picture of his rainy seasons , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been re@@ given for talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
came the topic of testing to the language ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : well , in the book it goes back to the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells of his perspective , as they played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t know that he led a strict regim@@ ent there .
but this would be said to be said , &quot; without these perfection@@ ism , but it would probably hardly have been possible to go into a well @-@ known rain forest , true cultural heritage of Europe and its musical tradition that went into tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with fortune cookies and Bon@@ b@@ bons , one does not make a great singer and before each success , equal to the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ profit .
as what do for a man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger at the talks with their book ?
Michael Ez@@ emann spoke of the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well @-@ met and always experienced a wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep believ@@ ing and warm @-@ good people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do just a fly in a little bit .
I get regularly with how many former cathedral sets even today , 23 years after his retirement for him , to keep him that he - he is almost blind , and it is a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that once strictly strictly strictly strictly in the minority in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ ans are grat@@ eful to him today that he en@@ forced her life and brought them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fathers @-@ married teacher - a very close father , who may be like his - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ur@@ son , which they still have to look at today and honour her .
and in fact , even though , all of what you prefer to him , are educational methods which were at that time at the agenda .
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly odd @-@ genu@@ in@@ ly , a man because he is promin@@ ently promin@@ ently promin@@ ently for a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ ners .
there is the evil intention that stood behind it , too .
the report , which has just been published , ent@@ la@@ ims him .
now I would be able to get a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps in Germany there is probably no one to know the rainy burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
