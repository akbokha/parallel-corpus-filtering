<seg id="3">A pits - where is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingärtner bees the unanimous reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map Münze promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous, if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi was held instead of a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of Geoportas Bavaria, is the state government's national government, all other than currently - yet very excited.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compares it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickephoe, which is not equal as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big overview map were mentioned for cities and municipalities in detailed maps, so-called Urals. "</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Trial Management between 1810 and 1864 and published the first surveying of Bayerns Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns of course - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the French troops made peace with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours, which created the idea of a surface-wide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and the Bayerische Trial Management founded.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Combination sheet of Munich dates back to 1856, and is like all other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Tonight is on the example of the state capital of the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has grown into all directions and has grown rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is undersendling, which is relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after creating the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses focus on 1856 along the present day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can't see nothing as fields - at the first sight: when using the hinge, a small-part map with dered lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "Urumption," which was derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots prove there any more farmers today - but small gärman of the plant "Land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienstadt, which was the site of the October century, in fact, was actually a meadow and a meadow.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names, "on the Gasteig," or from the height "At the ventilation" - but also in large letters "irres institutions."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße to be locked here with Wahnvortions here at the Auerfeldstraße.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59, the Munich-Irish institution "On the Auer Lübeck."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, led the establishment of a psychiatrist, who is brought to the death of King Ludwigs.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time, and ended, for example, the anchor chains of the so-called irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he says the staff, violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institutions.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, first place was first, later was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime even this capacity was not more - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirsis plant in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There have been there since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist en Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are young people in the Munich Salesianum on the area of the former Auer institutions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order was acquired in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located to the west, the soccer field of TSV Munich Ost, east of dormitories from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural connection to the origin of the Irrender Institute, who had been destroyed during the Second World War during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as "main square," the Kaufingerstraße was named "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought by the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies, in December 1944 many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pits in the Middle Ages once stood on the Marienhof, where this days is planned and will take place on 5 April 2017 in the breaking Ceremony for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-map can compare the old Munich-map with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof process.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights published published in Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel due to discreet policy and racial attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">The NAACP Travel Advisory Board of the State of Missouri, which will take into force up to 28 August 2017, will leave special attention through the state of particular attention to the state, as a set of fragworthy, rint-based accidents in the overall state, and here, "it is said in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people heavier to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which are unacceptable to minorities, the group said the NAACP, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"you have violations of the civil rights to happen people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be defeated because of their skin, they are assembled or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard it."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group followed incidents like racial crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in the beginning of the year, after he had no longer removed from the state by the State of Missouri, and from the police of Missouri, was accused of having accused of having a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also indicates a recently published report by the Office of the General Attorney-old of Missouri, in which black driver he will be more likely to be more frequently in the state 75 percent more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees inform about what could happen in Missouri might" "" "said." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be ready to bring whether the money-money or the relatives know that they are travelling by the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 Hasselt, according to the latest numbers from the FBI, who attacking the state in terms of the amount of such injuries on the 16. rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri Law that would be harder to keep a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had adopted the local criminal prosecution authorities, to commit people because of confidence, people because of confidence, which is due to the view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warning are generally issued by the State Department for other countries, but in the last time, stakeholders have been used as reaction to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">WeidezaunProject is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weideceln project is a successful project and is continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Assembly Peter White and Kordula Kovac took place on site a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the justification of the Schwendemann family met the representatives of the fish erbacher CDU region and together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann was initially offering insights into his operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and many young animals and in five apartments are accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" "Black Forest" is designed for him of the alternative-market path for the milk of its cows, such as tildemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">The facility is based exclusively for regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-chairman of Fishbach, he called the Weidezauno Project as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't find it to so steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area of space for a lot of work, much need to be processed using the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eluted operation and put these without any chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he has no bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor, Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezaunts and is glad about the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope so, so that the fact that the surfaces could be moved even a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and have thought about how they will bring its operations," emphasised the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers still stand because of the promotion of work often in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, the Weidezaundice promotion were fenced in 2013, 25 plots of eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open maintenance area amounts to 40 hectares, which can not be used until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leader was funded by the leader, the municipality of Fishbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers still have to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the Zäune," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you make a really good job, without farmers and land women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White was fixed: "here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The State Court (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will allow the state support of Weidezäunen.</seg>
<seg id="92">Objective is the open maintenance of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Condition is the presence of one of the LPR-drawn feed.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the unavoidable area should not be false. (hangers over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">To make the request of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build eight participants with 24 pitches.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the lower cost is more than 112 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump is the Statue of Liberty to make the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of an regime pack it is, if they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans know these equally as any other - therefore the sorrow at the fall of Saddam Hussein was at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key idea of the Trump regime, knew what he did he did when he did a symbolic Axt in a hitch with Jim Acosta by CNN over the suggestions of the president for drastic cuts to the Statue of Liberty with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">In order to remain fair, Miller attacked not the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat capers and Liberty-Imitators have made him that when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and especially the importance of their significance was attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an icon of American freedom which shout the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to what was added later, was not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is overcrowded, but as he stated it, it does not really feel the story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is going to have the contemporary Resonance on the moving words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the nusts of the poor: "your poor, your arms, your arms masses that would be free to breathe deeply, inhale, and the waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elende" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller engined not in literary criticism - it made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of a statue of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict to the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends, who made sure to place their words in her death on the basis - did you know that they had a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicism by calling it in an abused classical picture of the female Embodied Communication.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem, the female figure is not more abstract - she has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives themselves another name: mother of the exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant Female Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And precisely how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change the people from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great write-like Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist, argued that the Statue of Liberty's Liberty, but rather an early neo-conservative, who able to bring the American flame into the umped world: "Lady Liberty is progressing rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The fackel is not to get the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here at a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fantastic asievolle indeed from Lazarus existed in this way, as they saw from the exhaustive, but hoped for long and often terrible trips to the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump is ever seen.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their fackel is to unfold the way to the way, but hatred, who is the only source of power in power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black, Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two circuits were included to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance Director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the World Champion "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special," and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we are trying to understand it and we will continue to keep it on it," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete, remember that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athlete are medals from medals, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butovo - the members of Sir Mo Farah, while the team was elected to team's team's team mate Doyle.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter-speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were living or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that brought the Eiliie very of course, were fantastic. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medazzling syndrome who will compete in their fifth world championship rounds at the 400-m hurdle, says that it's "incredibly" is that 16 shaves are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runners Muir leads to this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">You will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot looking for one of a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships, when the only other shot in the Team Lee McConnell was relocated.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Man Chapterin says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their land sleute not only belong to the team, but in some cases, even at the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special team admits in the team, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, but to know that my teammate for me now and have chosen me, making it something very special for me," added it to me.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I'm very proud of all those who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came to.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as the established athlete, athletes, who want to rise to Poedies.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech made as chapter in concerns?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to set this home support, and we profit that we are back in the Olympiastadion are again.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it will simply be so great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from Kritikern on Facebook: bewirl you do not bear a public office if you don't bear the voters from voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long until the newspapers were forced him, from the Domestic Policy and its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He chased in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">He did not bear his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "in 1783, Washington said:" the expression can be taken away; and, stupid and silent, we are led like the sheep to the slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work out more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees have the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted the opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union, this was the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The founding of the Governors of the governor, the lawsuit filed as freezing, and the online commentary was full of any counterreaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">It is only Facebook, "said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is no reactionary head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and play his haunting head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the block of people who come to the Governors of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially called by employees that are paid by public tax dollar - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended the actions of the Governors of the Governors of the Governors and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing further than a presentation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's easy to use the picture of Troy or spoilt, or stupitted people that are online to go out online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real men that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments, respects and not profiting.</seg>
<seg id="184">The minister zipped the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hassmet, but it was asked to Hasselt to Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I disappointed that there was no reaction to Hasselt and other current messages," wrote them in the commentary box of the news series "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I guess this idea, even if a number of people came to the same topic, then they become more rather than a so-called collective deployment and recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the members of the Governors of the Governors as "concentrated spam-attack," other probably would probably be "intervening language."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by using a critic or negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It's much more clean than in the last time when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance and to burn or demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this happens exactly what happened.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials that criticises the Facebook and other social media is impacted.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The president of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County, last the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she took a electorate of her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be hard to be hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washington had the time of affordable Portos a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers were presented to his lead between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous correspondence writer.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who made pseudonyme as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters on newspapers who made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the shipping with Great Britain, according to the historical documents that have been collected by the George Washington Project on the occasion of the historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought it to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Expression of freedom, opposing views and courses are among the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars in real estate.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate in Victorias, worth $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developers Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their ownership and their business is divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wished to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation will take place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers 38 real estate worth over half a billion dollars, accumulated, since the family has purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis, now offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late Father, Colin - from Paul as "chief operators and the dominant personality," in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's wealth and Paul is about one-third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial system states that Colin owned that Colin owned the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be proved for Paul as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the" Colin proposed candidates have left him with the left, which I kept for the best objects, "he wrote in one of the first Affidavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed intermediaries the first hearing of the Supreme Court ruling was held.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, such as Paul claims against him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true but accuses Paul before, some owners and competent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hope to plan the fight.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family has the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs climb in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan ers, QC, and from both sides of the law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Wife De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, the dairy bars and gourmet shops in the late 1950's age and in the early seventies, a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">You used the security to buy collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeanser family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began in Westco there when he was a little child in my last years, when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she died and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to continue their property on her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often told me that he never wanted to land" brethren, "wrote them."</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are not more part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke as well as Mark are, says Paul, says Paul, "about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin made himself very returned, although he was a former AFL Board member and after a biography in 2015 from Eddie McGuire's best friend of TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media took up with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS, to say "I can really say much," because the case is before the dishes.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad, that my brother Paul decided to hearing me, and write our family names through the courts" he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our Father would not be able to say that Paul and I would like to fight in our current fight," said he says, "he was still on a solution."</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday, these hopes are over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our issue is solved in the near future of the dishes," wrote Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff is planning to validate the media detinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly it really do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">When yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to hold the information flow on President Trump, including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the chef on a reduced price.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">In John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, on his first day of work with executive officers he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps Weißem House, which he says: bad information that follows the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow, whether on paper or in letters - because the President's better decisions meet, if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Cellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to monitor Trisha, by increasing its media monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps long relationship is back for decades - and now, where he is still in the White House, is still strong in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate of Truman had been productive due to an unfair reporting it was more productive to convince him that he was able to convince him that he was to convince themselves," said the former voting consultant Sam Nunberg in February, compared to the police.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter be under control, according to six former presidential campaign, to ensure that his personal media sum has a steered lobbation."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter be ever under control, "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officials had something, what we do not know that Trumps Tweets without their interventions were still included.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably find something about the Tweets, which has not sent out Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff was doing it already some times, sleger of him, and then do their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has to prevent it, that trump controversy is worsened.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that the people in a White House which consists of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by increasing trump material, which promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite with this story - reported in May through the prelove of consultants, president of a strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of which was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to respond to negative press lines, especially those with damaged leaning, and that he can find out to find out why they come out.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone gave a printed copy of an article by Gotovina, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accusing the deputy commander of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a Cluster of Lectures" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson has been banned from Twitter, or it has no concrete evidence, or it has been in the past's false allegations, saying that it has been false.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trisha read the article and started to ask people over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">In addition, the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage the papers and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How has the folt?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried to do three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove more effective manager as Priebus, but trump is still his self-effective self, and his advisors are still subject to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unaltered factors make cellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia-affair around US President Donald Trump is scheduled to have a presentation of the so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The body has recorded work in the past weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under reference to the thing.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has extended its investigation and intensifying its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported CNN reported the first pre-invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps, oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">US secret services accuse the Kremlin for longer, specifically to have mixed into the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether they were between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the magnifying.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks that the Sonderkommando Trump went into the centre, and on the privilege to see whether the President is worsenate during the affair during the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence to check out in possible failure, and decide whether the charge is cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys should therefore be called anchor chain.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly, it is switched on if there are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always run behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be switched on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the interrogation of egg.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the transmitters CNN were already invitations to join the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons, who were involved in the meeting were asked to be called on a statement that was called on the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trunk Jr. also Trumps consultant and law-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his damaging election campaign of Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">The experts were told on Thursday evening in the US television that the condition is showing that Mueller should not be able to work out in his work, and that it should be necessary, soon to be quick.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it is not inevitably noted that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nonetheless, the reduction of the committee in the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to meet the occupying force for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new disclosure used by the President on Thursday evening a speech in West Virginia in order to provide the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia-story is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Demokrates a chance to feel "good, because they have nothing else to talk about that they may speak."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special consultant Ty Cobb explained a statement that he was nothing of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This work is also commonly used in the case of salaries, he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House testify any measures aimed accelerated the work of the special intermediary on the "faire."</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chef James Comey had said three times that, not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something changed, the name was in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used to go to Truman Comey after Truman Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this problem, the accusations had become trump at Trisha, he would like to do justice for the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, according to a setup of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands for an investigation under large pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Following presentation of US media, the White House collected the White House Material against the Sonderforschungsbereich and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Discounted speculators moreover, as Trunk Mueller will be released from whether Truman Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Contrary to an independent special edition of the Congress, Richard Nixon, the President of the President, Richard Nixon, has given us a position in which he theoretically elected to the President of the Department of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarktis: huge Eisberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctica a huge iceberg surrounded by the barely seven-fold size Berlins from Schelag.</seg>
<seg id="1520">That was the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Maritime Research on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The vast majority of heavy and 5800 square kilometers large colonists now come to the north and will probably need two, three years, until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres longitude and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant, the researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger of people is not coming from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">Inwievement of climate change played a role at the demolition of the Eisberg, is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">A total of some 30 years, it has been a series of unusual conveyors of icicle in the region, writes the US-Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, that hanging with the global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelag.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Sceldo swimming pool on the sea and is sinned by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows up to the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelag is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeeder was the balance of wax and break off some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete schooner is thought there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It's no matter that the Larsen-C-Scheldest are in danger of danger, because the forefront wirelessly have never pulled back as far as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice-plate was also cut under the voltage and could be crushed on to a key office.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Scheldo and Eisberg increases the sea level not because they swim on the water and ice cream so much water, as it arises after the melting yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shrub is that the glaciers can easily flow into the sea and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">That could possibly increase the sea level, however, only in low size, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelgo is after AWI-data and nearly 50 000 square kilometers, Antarctic's fourth-largest shrine of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the mainland from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front of the sea, around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There is regular regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural way to climate change, the icplate is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary, "said Martin O'Leary by the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"that is the most comprehensive retreat since the beginning of the Chronicle," also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scientists be contested, whether the Larsen-C-Schelholidays will again grow back or long-term, he said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that there will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg on the climate change, so in the past decades, however, many ice strings of the Antarctic peninsula fall away.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of Antarctica extends in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">This rise was contributed to the temperature increase.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula have passed around three degrees Celsius and is thus among the areas in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Lavendel is due to the differences in the conditions and due to the diseases of drought, scientists and farmers that are trying to find solutions to find solutions, big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the plant in Provence was exposed to the effects of climate change, which has much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impacts on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium, the Zwergzikades transfers, and with very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavendeline oil not only for vacationers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and weakened either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">These solutions, which are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slowdown of the soil, but also the supply of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water, and the development of varieties that are exposed to dry resistance.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalists emphasising the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly magazine Riodoce meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the State of Sinaloa, organised crime, corrupted officials and undefiled drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routine tests.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what more safer: they should take their kids to the office in 2009 that they were with grenades in 2009, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">The experts have three words to a panel on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, associations.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Ask the Reporter, name for each column - no evidence is necessary to do truth and abdominal.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug-mugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to have suspected on the content list of the government or the cartons, a catalog of breasts that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no difference of violence, and throughout the country, and throughout the land, there are no more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken place in December 2012. 589 have been expelled from attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were seven deaths in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her contactator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest bug is to live in Mexico, and to be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His order is deeply welcome, although his presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take less than two months after his death, and reporter about their shared themes, the gma, their nightmares, insomnia, Paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010, a probe was built in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, these were initiated by the Committee on protection of journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most thousands of Morden, which are associated with drug-drug and organized crimes, are given to the killers of journalists only rarely before court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce they are still able to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uninhabited and even though the terrain is now still budgetary.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the mortar, without justice, the meeting became a discussion of safety, "says Ibarra," says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very dumb, my time in this workshop," says he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Warum, misstrust we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He abolished it just a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla started out of two men. it was poured out of his car and 12 times, presumably written on him because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Schütze drove in his car and damaged close to your car.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors of rumors tend to fly in Culiacan, to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the theme of Valdez there is virtually nothing as a tail.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans, last year and the extradition of the United States in January was Sinaloa to one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, as rivalzing fragments were fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It's nothing to be shot in Sinaloa every day or even several people on the road are shot, or that the cemetery is full of dedicated, two-storey Mausoleen for drug cooking, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget it for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its precious ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez is aware of the dangers of his work was Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believed that two abuse of misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially in February, the publication of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalisitive antitrust policy in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have taken the sons of the issue, suspected the power members of each copy of the issue, as soon as they delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez not to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had the same history, the country has to leave the country to his own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues did it, that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he served as an experienced Reporter of Noroeste, who joined Riodoce's foundation in 2003 and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without losing the noise problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper served a reputation for the muetigen and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took part.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter it, hard-aperture studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication given in which they could read stories that no one could be able to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot's award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the protection of journalists from the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up to fear that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to pass on further," he said at the time of the CPJ Award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Romsviento in last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must assume the task to take you as a journalist, either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what you have done in view of many dead... why did you not said what?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun, who like a harbour workers, was able to make a friend who knew the generalarming and advice, a teacher who knew how to be survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in its routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always always sit down to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit in the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well ask her: was his love for routine use?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also has forced them to pursue their own attack in question, how they can do their work on the best, and to stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you don't like it, if you're talking to their wives, their children, their clean stores, their native home and landers, to move drugs to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-sur and self-sterling.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own Instinkers trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it is wrong, lead out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be worn... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and other states, are no longer - just as in Tamaulipse, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lusmuggelrouts, weak institutions and corrupts government officials is home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes steadily.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees met by Riodoce to safety training, suddenly there were no mobile phones. days before, Spyware, which was sold exclusively on governments, to monitoring the monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a building.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a fourth-quarter district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the shear, we asked some of the reporter, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who had the governor itself as a trustworthy being.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporter in the mountain scenery, where the drug traps are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has made three main stories on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of his brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the national expenditure that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led to one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the government, an abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word that was abducted or as it happened, so it was prudence that everyone in the city knows that every one in the city knows that the restaurant is a favourite locally recurrent development and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">An reporter from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political party, which belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which has been ruled all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI-Governors were accused of corruption for high-performance cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal asked the reporter about the previous events in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman passed a military service.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months beforehand, the readers of Valdez, as the best informed about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "earlier," "" "earlier," "" "said," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with nickname" El FLACO "" "" due to its slim body composition. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our springs are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the Morde from journalists. because the staff had become something important what they have never been expected, activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Repent, Miriam Ramirez Snappte himself a few signs and went to a demonstration on a demonstration due to another journalists from the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his position.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists had been stronger, by being written in organized protests "SOS Press" on content because of buildings and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">Bojorquez is a director of Bojorquez in Washington and tried to collect international support for the Justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to replenish journalists and they bring it to the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that it was once again divided from the government, because it is worried about their anger was hurt in the government.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime, involved in the government officials and an equally valid company. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that Reporters will not only be killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, organised the organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the "Articulo 19" media group has more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you'd like to hit the mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the Morde have a terrible effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one fermented the death of the Blogist Maria Elizabeth Macias in the Northern border state of Tamaulipas before six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note, which was allegedly signed by Zetas's Kartell: "I am because of my report."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headsets apart from their abrupt head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, after the assassination of Corroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others will continue to go like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug box with a guide on the title page "What do you want to talk about us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still searching for the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are adjourned, as it seems the photographers Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 together with four women in a flat in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue work, there is a daily dance with risk-free decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once said to be the poets, gives him that the drug can be scaled him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and therefore I was reporter in reporter."</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting in front of the office and drank beer, than once all their phones to sums up.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting plants with bandendowment and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had to leave the dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war was continued, as it was promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the on-board, they have released the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page was changed to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens in the vicinity - a more shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a view to the police, the guard held to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they had afraid at all, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, followed the staff of Riodoce's traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"" "" "" "you can also remember that" "" "Bojorquez," "" "when the same day, on the Javier, the internship of antin was asked to send them to the road to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs are using camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">On the first glance, it looks like a statue, if a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now, researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhints of a Canadian government were so well received that experts have described as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well that they could even recognize that his slippskin of reddish brown was - and they said they would have had something of a "invisible past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the magazine "Current Biology," called him as "the harvested Dinosaurs, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The dossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievable good original condition, researchers, who described it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports, National Geographic, the gepanzee plant fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn funk, when he was found on March 21, 2011 in the Sunflower Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be at the surrounding rock fehl on the Platze, and he decided to take more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years with the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 lbs).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of these hard work, the finished result is ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are only blind with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept:" the main writer Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will be found in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaurs copies - Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. "</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant fresser, though he is covered with a armor covered tanks, likely to be threatened by flesh and dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The badly damaged dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide them, and used a paragliding technology that is known as counter-labeled, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix better to its surroundings and its enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier took place in May for the first time and is now available in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studying the wild animal and it's Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and shape of shoes and armour through his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the concreting, an spread defense method in animal, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the contamination is common, the results are surprisingly low as the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs are geared by enough printing by eating dinosaurs. the evolution of the confrontation was used as a means of excess life.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the animals that use the shaded shady, you think of Rehe, Zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and violate than prey, what signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to an authentic survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong Raubtier behavior on a massive, strongly gepanzler dinosaurs have been shown how to have been dangerous to have the dinosaurs." "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaurs was rotein.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in information about his life, including its conserved Darminhaltes to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, died in a river and dropped to the sea, where he dropped on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was Alberta as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landing when they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because he has covered completely with conserved skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal remains almost as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need a lot of imagination to use it to reconstruct. if you throw only a little with the eyes, you might believe that it is on sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermopopods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who walked on two legs who walked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions years after Borealopelta, the gestuffed dinosaurs was captured by some of his fury ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 walk (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest developments in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta was scaled down after the death in the sea and mud muddy.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk, when he was found on March 21, 2011 in the Sunflower Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the beeked dinosaurs in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snail to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained 2 20-inch long spikes that were razed by its shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the panzee plant fresser was shot through the western Canada until a flooded river in the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs are kept his dogs in exquisite item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well-preserved that the bonnet is still standing in the dinosaurs and cover the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">Like Michael Greshko for National Geographic, it is such a level of preservation so 'rare as a profit in Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Ever more I see it, the more confused it is.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The remains of the skin, always cover the holiness of the skin, always carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His rechter front lies on his side, his five-finger are divided into the top.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds on its sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage: many wounded.</seg>

<seg id="2005">The train guide will get on their mobile devices a message that passenger X is located in the train, and the booked seating space is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train's train is made at room Y knows that there is a passenger with already unlock online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So, you can continue to pass on further, continue in silence.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which again use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel without a ticket control through our train staff, channelling the DB Navigator just itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second Plus: "and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">If you often cross country, knows that in addition to tasting and missed trains, the ticket checks are to the biggest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, one does not have any documents in any case, but one of the people don't need all documents that need to use online tickets for the evaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or number of identity card or otherwise a document that you must be preceded.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The consequence are endless discussions between train transfer and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the end or space and delays in the control of your own tickets and the Schaffner takes up at the end time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after they arrived in New York City, sat in St. Louis Geborene in the bed of a Airbnb apartment, rented the rented and scrollte by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">You stumbled on a post of Yemen from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">In just 18 years, the police killed an 18 year old child, and still is still on the road, called it was there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since nobody else did not pass on their feed the information, she decided to Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper in the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He post a picture of Browns's total body that was stretched on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," thought out Ferrell. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But the death was nothing new for her and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">It also laid her mobile phone starting at the eve of Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people, cried, and from a man who claimed to be his father's father, a sign with the inscription: "Fergusher police killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They observed a live feed, with which a policeman, was a group of protesters with a bellish dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that another polish is his army and cried, and cried: "I will kill you... animals all kill you."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not common" "" "recalled Ferrell at their statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us, and that we can call us."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt Schütt.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was waking and wine. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home to the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she won her 6-year old daughter from her father's house, and decided that the two will come to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in movie theaters from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of the survivors and of the protest, love and power, the strength and resistance force which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and the streets do not have to challenge answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came with her daughter, a flower dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two are talking about this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you are not only when I taught you, when I have to fight you, when black man must fight for that?" recalled to what they said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boys and that was not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take it with" "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is, is a highlight of the... what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and brought it to it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we do to do to liberate free to liberate ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I had lucky enough to give you a experience of experience, where they don't experienced a eklatant Racism, it is not different than the next black women.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling, I would like to hold a bad service to hold them. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson, the South of Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, was at a camp site when activists come to the potential non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There have been Ferrell and her daughter with a local business owner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed after 9 August total," said she and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association and focused on Essens-Justice and health education in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organ."</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell passed during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to talk only "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question was Ferrell in the sense: "you will be document or tried to find a history that you can take you?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepsis was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared: "we had heard that people who are born in Ferguson and raised up, their voices are not centred, and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, a artist from the field that is known for his activism rum to Todestract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment, Ferrell passed the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing to me how those people will be represented, because I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The aim was to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not by the movement "not around a Messiah guide, but to a community which comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most important participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a consequence, documents produced by "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, how she loves and married her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and leighth when they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I haven't understood that this work and in the case of human beings must have a certain vulnerability."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's history is repeated on the role of black swung women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of movement, following the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012, the film "BlacklivesMatter" have been minted in social media, identify as fluctuul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in management positions have been carried out in the movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight at various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, schwule women need to carry the main last of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan voted to notice that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it is noted that "this is not a mativer type of action," when the Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "she was the person who called this energy," she said. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront front, because during a life at these crossings, as a black, schwule wife is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can see their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news department store in Ferguson has disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency of a demonstration for 2 ½ years because of blockage of a demonstration on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls their home: "an chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they clipped in a singing and she feels like this memory, ever since she went to Ferguson on the road three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is to win our duty.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We will love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "magnitude" up to "Orwahn": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south-country pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation 2009, the population in advocacy and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the topic hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed in our Facebook page "People and Bitburg" on our Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While one of the bit gallery says: "this would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "this would be real-class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man" (Siggi Bose) or very simply: "Orwahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While preparing to build a gallery more customers in the city, one of them also benefit from the rest of the other, the opponents, that the pedestrian zone will be haemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned on the grounds of the property, in which the farmer's market hall is offering its products in 13 direct market.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher would like to integrate a brand hall in the new building - namely to the Beda Square, to the outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been selling almost every week in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the Landing are always very pleased.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We have discovered the butcher's butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all, the gallery of the gallery has a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also a too.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Above all the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if the direct market receives in a brand hall in the gallery, arrives at the height of renting.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This should probably be too low in the new project, but probably not just too low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "our shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether garment, shoes, drinkage or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shoppers of stores here are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But there is not even one of the upcoming weekly market, it is the more important that at least the market hall remains at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For this, the commodity is freshly made fresh, is also offered directly from the producers, and is also reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shoppers will be able to use only from larger companies in a shopping scenter, because the people are not able for a retailer often.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops are almost no longer and that is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a brand hall is not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where is the peasantry thalle during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on time when the bit gallery is actually coming back sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or it creates the Gespenst Bit Gallery previously, all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this is simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, that is empty, no one needs no one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">With my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market, it's why thanks to the wahnt, thanks I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the peasantry is broken, it will disappear again a piece of culture disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are on display - white, black and brown, that are almost invisible to the same - that are caused to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuators and Haarmann, which have been sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyst had a 35-year-old prison sentence after she made public diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline had been transformed into technology, computer sciences and art. he was converted to condemning the condemnation of Barack Obama, when he had just three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, and that if something with these genomic data could look like to be interpreted as they can be interpreted as they can be interpreted, and the inharder detection of this interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been spoken about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 due to 20 prosecutations, including six crimes against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison the prison was oppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a liqueurs, black and white Selfie, in which Manning is clearly visible on a driver seat and a platinblond Perg - with whom it was associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of its 2012-Project 'strand'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist's portraits are produced by stranger of artefacts such as cigarette silent and chewing gum by using the DNA from the waste, to produce an image that could look like those people could look like these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from an newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">They led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in jail and she wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article, "Dewey-Hagborg declared an press review in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't be visited this time, and she couldn't get photographed in this time, therefore, contact with Chelsea and asked them to make if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">In the course of two years, the artist and their incarcerated Muse were exchanged during two years, several letters were exchanged during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They were even illustrated by Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Supporing images" which saw a future foreseen in the president of Chelcias, and she was willing to see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings for seven thousand years in Kansas would be able to challenge a welcome kind of happy support.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even at the opening of the exhibition, Donald Trump is a war against informants from the government-camp and against transgender forces to find new, tweeters to the starring spores, which he really fix, further too.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said that "things happen out of a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery's artistic statement called Manning with their oversized signature, among them (the "i" in its family name) an end of the "Automatic splitle," whose basis is sex, race, sex and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millimeter of Cs and Gs and As, are written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg was hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or Nuclotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological ways we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people don't believe that our genome is not because of our interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell many different stories, so that's the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is one side mentioned above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as it is mentioned in the hands of the disciplinary United States like King-Hong Kong, as well as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they are talking about your speech, they have won them," says it. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "never the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it was a letter from a letter that she wrote to me," said the artist, who is from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still can still go to see if I speak."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it predictive in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be greeted by their own genomic simulator, such as Horden of protections.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also targeted, as all in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), who had been written with a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it to the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human amount," said Dewey-Hagborg, "said."</seg>

<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the forehead of workplace culture, you don't have to have the next uber that has been involved in Skandals, since then a former employee has been published in Skandals, which describes a environment of Belief together, where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118,7 billion by 2020, according to the final technical site Let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent bad behaviour, looked at increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year, in the heart of the uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convert has almost 600 clients, including airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convertible, customized "Puls-," allows confidence, confidential answers to real-time and the heat-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS-hotline, with the employees of bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main leader is included, complaints confirmed directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulations," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent, said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or is unethical, it can be tasted consequences through consumers-Boykott, Workers "Fluid and Klagen," said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, converts for more than one year to ensure that employees are related to politics and methods, and have a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier if an employee wanted to sign a problem, he had to find a number of telephone number or e-mail for the company's headquarters, formal and hope that it was seriously taken.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company converts to use problems, problems of leadership forces, who were sitting in offices in cities or countries, were hidden - like discrimination, Beletching or unspoiled internment and can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management of Ruby from Ruby.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in employment and legal consequences."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take ethics, values and staff commitment in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke out because of etheric-scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took us until the "Sociale media has come to their right" to prevent companies that you did not prevent their dirty welcome online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology on the monitoring of ethics, human hope used as a strategy" "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent are offering your software as service as the service, and the company with recurring fees for use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that the approval of venture capital investors will have to support both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Converts received $10 million for the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investment will hardly be surprising, in view of the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research, that shows today's staff of their jobs more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries are older and interesting projects only.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you will be accepted and estimated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if the people are glad to do in a company that will make it worthwhile to do this company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Feeder returns, if their portfolio will run good. companies run good, if employees are engaged, and are engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools will promise third promise, commitment and use of employees, it is not a wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on the experts of workplace culture is important to the experts of workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is usable, if the implementation of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company employees ask for your feedback, it can be anticipation that change in the way is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not occur enough, or not at all, this is a disappointment and staff.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 talks, you have to have ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen the company to have left themselves on collecting data. "</seg>
<seg id="2250">"for if you do not follow the staff," Have you really heard me?</seg>
<seg id="2251">Please take care of this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you are not to take care of why I should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now leads about monthly employees, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is about Glint reports, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And following the feedback from frustrated employees it was driven by the speed of the decision to organize several teams within the company's decision to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby, the company receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that on a long point of view, this is known for a better bond of working workers in an industry, known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2274">Bruins-player should take the hotel from this weekend, but Mora grants a problem that there may be a problem as soon as these rooms are free of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"that is a real problem, and it's not far away to think that the people rent there in a room and then set up there to set a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the videoband from a exercise, it is a rather good business.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creation of a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video at a squeeze music video and was an gorges for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980-ies.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarious Yorkshireman with a forelove for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from Yemen, which has been dead for over 300 years," says he weaker.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'covered the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who illustrated in Scotney - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have just written on the thumb of a letter on the side of a letter which was written by a double-soldier in the 1700-90s, who worked for the Jakobab," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And there is always smoke to smoke, because at that time, it was a fire because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he would be too.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who has been defeated by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England, he lived and nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have given my welcome grudge a little,") it seems to be beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the viktorianic "new" castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mononuclicks on walls and the bottles who had spent centuries in grabs.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the premises and the ruins of the old castle, and said with Landscape, fermentation, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was only received the full access in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes began one decade later, the workers began to take care of the archive in order to take care of the archive as "hundreds of years in which Aristokrates said," Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Taverns, Letters from the time of English Empires, cards, which had said, "you could be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch in order to fight two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's all his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point for the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who is a man to join the newly built castle to join the peasantry of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a wristwatch, who entered 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knighost family of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasantry started in this area and I thought, an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">May the two are connected to each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are fixed in the history of the castle, like 'The Priest', the story of the Jesuit's history, the family Darrell lasted seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', represented in the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, which he filled with stones with stones (a discovery that was only a few years later when his Sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Perrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentleman's chic Gauner, will always make debt to make debt and money for things that they couldn't make.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell forms in their schooling, by paying many old women - I am against me as a heap-in-looking guys, with a talent to be landlocked in landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of its application in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique write-experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has spent a two week stay in Finnish game for a comic novel about Eläglki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been recalled back to nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascent of sex robots is real, and we should be worries</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazy that 2017 is a new report about the technological development in the area of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots from the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotik and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelid of the robot, the form of chest, and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make fun over her, but the companies offer lots of it, and we will get much more frequently in more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have been developed by their inflatable partners to robot with a silicone, that feels warm - with respect to human reactions, that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Users can also select his robot as well as in accordance with its balance, "to select all the eyeliers of the robot through the shape of the chest, until the type, or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worrying, as many robot that have "personalities," that would like to look back a Stepford's woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have been developed to robot with a silicon convent.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adjust its robot to the characteristics that they can find themselves, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Robot's Gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who is due to your personality, as well as possible," is heated the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So what you like to do you like and they do not like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It has, during the course of the day, they also have their vocal - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">They may not be tired to be fixed on conversation, or they may be "in mood"! "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many unfavorable aspects of this ascent of sex robots - not least because they replace true human relationships - but the substituting female properties, that if you go a step on Frigid (called here: conflicting) Farrah, not calm one on most of them.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can males then do not have Roxxxy?" it is on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robot not only have a feedback or content just a different sex game.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinesse on a bit darker and tying it in our culture, to a retreat of the ideal gender equality of the sexes, to a desire for sex with submissions than optional.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are of course no sex robot, and while the FRR will hold its rising popularity, but they still remain at the edge of consumer goods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what out of the marry zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or bellows, until them the free market gives the permission to use.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overview that these highly developed sex robot in a time appears to be threatened in which the rights of women are threatened in the White House which has been threatened to have women sexually mature, women are sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handle's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devoured body and the stolen eyes, but as realistic these vision.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of a healthy human Son...</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binsenhisheit of the Trunk era that the political donation which have polarized the US electors, also have families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest were made in the U.S. newspapers with advice about how to avoid using the horror of Truman's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We have rigorous all of us to use our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The power of Trumps, Families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-left Dichterin, who lives in Chicago, has lived and worked for a long time with the Republicans in our family to visit me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You reminded me that the unit can have a mighty effect on a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trunk sitting in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relatives, with whom they had fought decades because of the policy, suddenly, suddenly and all times on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this is also significant risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trunk, but the effect of his presidency has the power to move all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that us will no longer run out of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a scatterer long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which appear once compared to its standards it suddenly appear as an epitelling of verses.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find me today of a active nostalgia in the carp, which 14% income tax (but at least, we did how his tax declaration looked) - which both in comparison to Trump in fact is a very milde stratified.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trunk goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritual, to qualify as a immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin came in the city, we brought our children to Karusel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you have no caffeine.</seg>

<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange experience because two two-year-old age, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I would like to use the Karusel, I would have given him a full score, but luckily nobody asked him required.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel cars: what do for the benefit now need</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly the software update will be held?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Need diesel driver to take part in the action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in the overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">At the diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software will be offered for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the emission behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are except of them except.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine of the ACE Auto Club Europa is invaluable:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the actual software updates are voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates before they are valid only for vehicles, the Schumann software," says Anja Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their disarmament has ordered the Federal Aviation Authority (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when, customers are informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers have a rapid implementation in the next few months, but still does not have any exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed informed of every person for every person.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If the inspection is due to an inspection, this will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long the change had come in total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"it's hard to say," says Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Provisions are from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen, surrendered to the Autoherers on the topic of the environment."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should last the update?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The rearmament itself could last only three to four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-time could be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What would make car that drive no car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE is waiting for.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Presumably foreign manufacturers would be traced, so Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is a massive price fall from Euro-4-cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE should be fears.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But in the regions, where you are dropping.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural areas, there are no value losses for older diesel.</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the City of life</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to celebrate the next year in Rente.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable applicants are but rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years Wacker's urban builders.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work makes it still big fun as he conveys in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports for varied, but also challenging tasks that wait for its successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, surprised him that so far no candidates had the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the next time a architects or engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This is to be said - in attention of the regular termination freeze - enough time for a preparation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has been responsible for the administrative community as subordinated construction authority, the applicants must be preceded by appropriate lines.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to retain the city to any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not fill out this no longer, would have to drive out the citizens of consultation to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of the city and him himself is important, "Wacker who reported from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">For more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated over the Wacker with pride and look back.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we do the city of life," he is over the building office and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future there are varied projects at the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofenpark parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The cinema bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter is last updated with around 1.5 million euros, "if we make it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all great tasks on my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">Work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Gesture has been present for a urban development of big playing space.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs's own building yard and Gärtnerei could be flexible to frequent.</seg>
<seg id="2556">You can move much, "so Wacker, and the design of green plants will be mentioned by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye that fits" if new buildings will be approved, emphasises the formation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The city-maker is high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">The builder, "at the end, everything goes through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">At the time of care and coordination, he can count on his longtime staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been around for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains a long time, Wacker said: "we are looking for someone who were really identified with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Who would like to thank Roland Wacker who wants to be able to introduce a closed studies as a diplomat or Bachelor, and is also able to have a specialised knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal office of urban planning and civil engineering, construction planning, Grunderwerable, administration of urban property, urban engine with building yard and urban bodies, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle on lines were thrown: southern path closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to police, previously unknown, the Blue bike made by the railway station on the Leobener Straße (B116) were thrown onto the lines.</seg>

<seg id="2572">Next to the damage on the Lok and the plant, as well as the late-minute drive and costs for the rail traffic, even Pöns from the train could be on to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In total, it was a total of "significant" sum, "said the speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were fixed on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the south track could be led without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Just ten persons, Friday morning, two of which concerned the remote traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">They didn't exist, however, they had to delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres can be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Isolators and Masten were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, caused by stomach cracking, and bubble, recurring or blood flow, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the people normally use, meat and dairy products, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid of trypophan of proteins were to develop immune cells that promote immune cells to promote immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The lead explorer, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microorganisms who are hidden in food, not in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are imminated, inflammations, are derived from cells that promote tolerance and body protect, without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance goes far away in the direction of inflammation, it may result of inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it has been found that a kind of tolerance immunological cell was found in mice that bear a certain bacterium in their deposits.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance, manufactured.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan, the mice in their food, the more had made them from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and an tryptophan of rich diet tolerate, less inflammatory cymbeus promotes the same system even with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoktorman in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immunological findings but found out that a group of academic powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separated, but it was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It believed that the difference with the intestinal microbids of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were examined DNA sequenced, and it were six bactericiaries that were present in mice with the immunotherapy, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were infected in a sterilen environment, so that they were not developed by the intestinal microbiom and they were not developed this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria could grow to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and overled small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - due to the immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">The active component of the liquid was cleaned out, proved to be a tributary of tryptophan metastases, which is known as the Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers needed the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues halved, the number of cells fell by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and protect the most of us L. reuteri in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known to whether tryptophan outset products from L. reuteri the cells can develop as in mice, but defective in relation to the tryptophan relationship with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote inflammation of inflammatory effect on the inner surface of the Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high level of tryptophanvalues to present in the presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of these population. "</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "" "" Domspatzen-report, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "" "</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Rainsburger Domspatzen report to the abuse of Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse of the Rainsburger Domspatzen provides further for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Cherry, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," published by the former Rainsburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be the top of the Catholic Church very serve when Müller and Ratzinger would put their deepest on their own branches or their then false assessment of preoperations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "in contrast, the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano "criticised that" "" "respecting violence during the" "" "two-lei levels" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the tackless of Regensburg-two fle no one knows that it would be prevented in order to be prevented, but conspicuous, however, conspicuous, however, conspicuous, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioeethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the usual, the Catholic Church as a source of all exercise, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion that is preparing for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">The princess of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we love to the church and that is a change of Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, it pointed out that in its youth-bats a very normal pedagogical means "have been" to have been finished, "to be done with frechen children, as I was one, ready to be done."</seg>
<seg id="2899">For example, they seem to apply - today set the standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse, often Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared in connection with the reports.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely to unquite, author and historian Michael Ezemann spoke with Ratzinger's memorandum for "My brother of Pope" (in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he will demonstrate the results of the final report. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What's exactly what is in the 440 page report, which was submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightense Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 rainfalls had been identified between 1945 and early 1990 "with high plausibility," victim of access, 67 Domspatzen sexually abuses.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, Germany: "in summary, the fact that the Domkapellmeister was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Just in high emotional effects, the visitation could be trimmed for the pupils.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to many other suspects that many victims were invaluable by R. estimations and therefore in many cases, despite violence even had positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann, why the final report for the abuse of the Rainsburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger appeared in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the "incidents of violence in the rainforest." there is a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For an increase of many students "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who was handy of the Öfteren when a Domspatz has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How to be the Biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Ezemann: if one reads all the effort and all 440 pages long report from front to the back, you have to ask, why the name is Georg Ratzinger at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complication or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence at the pre-school events occurred outside of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can see it in the case for him, or first of these things, not seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzar grammar school, which he was involved in virtually all those surveyed - as literating - "salvation," "sky," and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">For instance, the broad majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent witness, "competent" and "comprehensible teacher, who guys regularly performed regularly with cakes, cookies as well as Bonbbons, and always led by children of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority was worth over his perfectionism and its high emotional effects, which led to Wutches already in time.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't get only with chairs and the key federation on the ground, but also earing, too, cried to the hair or ears, he has given himself up even more years ago, deeply worsened and apologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">In his honorary situation, however, it must be said that such education methods have been in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely distributed, parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know yet such trachtigational methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Also I have experienced in a world school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually in this report, the cause sexual abuse and the violence on the school, are the free batellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Because we ask, whether it is not rather with his friend and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI, so many media has just reduced to him on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, yes, many who never understood it, still freezing.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth however is: the report was Georg Ratzinger in every sense!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was reported much about the subject of misuse in the Rainsburgs cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2930">George Ratzinger is also present in the final report to any problems or co-knowledge with respect to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victim of sexual violence claims to have been entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never stopped to speak with my father, or my mother," "" "said to speak for the other," It was all very peinated. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the lightening of sexual abuse was, however, it is that most of the victims from Scham.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't trust her parents and siblings, they were definitely not a choral manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How this is what the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in respect to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a fragmentary student stated that: "concerning sexual abuse, I see no case in which he had said before (Georg Ratzinger) would have had legal knowledge and could have seen the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... also for really absurd to take you that... Buben haunting or clear or more recently opened, as compared to their parents, internatants, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - More... "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report on the whole result is clear: "that in advance of affected students and / or their environment, the environment was not confirmed in the framework of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus freed by every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So, it may not be charged with him, not to prevent him or to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name with these rebellious crimes in connection as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media it was much of "violence against" in the rainy burger cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of a report on the report of the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must be living with this privilege?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hemann: that's the great problem that in the reporting it is missing, and it became a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, anywhere, in the midst of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">However, this is a abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is clean separated: between the school and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, we say it once, rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report's incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral member of the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole live inspection-pedagogy of cases, in which boys were chipped and painted, and killed amongst them, all of them on the school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous economy have to have to have.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But in fact, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when she had already been at the Domspatzar grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">At the same time, like the very witnesses, the topic "pre-school" tabu. "</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to come to its and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise-paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was contrary to the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: because of the discipline was already a discipline, but not a sac violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims of the general humanity by R. carried out and therefore in many cases, despite violence even have a positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at the same time remains the privilege to have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was allowed only to define two periods in which it was reported on the school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself, and from the predecessors of a school where he had not worked and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again, around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger completed his ears in front of the listeners?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium director, which was even reproduced in 1989.</seg>
<seg id="2964">It shows that it suggests that in the school, the testing is still practiced in the school. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in light of the risk of negative presses, he would be urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was of course at a time when legal clarity was also forbidden in Bavaria as a testing and had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that it occurred in a legal grey area, like everyone of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate the people of maybe, or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say it, he would have been shocked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not easy.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The testing was officially abolished in Bavaria and officially was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it would be too bad today to turn the standards for the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see what?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hemann: we speak about the "Fallstrick of the Anachronism," i.e. the danger of having to evaluate the past of today moral periods.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess already has been quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is of course not valid for sexual abuse, who was inscribed in all times and also not for what happened in the school of resistance and violence at unschool children, this goes far beyond the back then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I need George Ratzinger in protection, because all these had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds to the disciplinary committee and punishment, so eares and ears on the hair and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Then, he was forbidden as a physical activity, he has also passed away.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his rainy seasons, Georg Ratzinger has been regiven for talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the topic of testing to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Ezemann: well, in the book it goes back to the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, as they played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't know that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this would be said to be said, "without these perfectionism, but it would probably hardly have been possible to go into a well-known rain forest, true cultural heritage of Europe and its musical tradition that went into tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With fortune cookies and Bonbbons, one does not make a great singer and before each success, equal to the field, but always discipline, passion and self-profit.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what do for a man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger at the talks with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Ezemann spoke of the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger really well-met and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, deep believing and warm-good people, from which one can't imagine that he could do just a fly in a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former cathedral sets even today, 23 years after his retirement for him, to keep him that he - he is almost blind, and it is a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that once strictly strictly strictly strictly in the minority in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspans are grateful to him today that he enforced her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fathers-married teacher - a very close father, who may be like his - but also a lovely respecturson, which they still have to look at today and honour her.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And in fact, even though, all of what you prefer to him, are educational methods which were at that time at the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly odd-genuinly, a man because he is prominently prominently prominently for a more prominent brother to make a medial sinners.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stood behind it, too.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which has just been published, entlaims him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now I would be able to get a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps in Germany there is probably no one to know the rainy burger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
