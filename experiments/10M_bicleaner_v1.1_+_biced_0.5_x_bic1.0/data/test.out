Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger went with a few colleagues at the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses were shot on her big night , they hunt in fast gal@@ lop to the feed .
I have been afraid at this pace . I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and in this he ended the equ@@ est@@ rian barrier then again .
on Saturday , the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - back in the vicinity of horses .
he settled in photo with his family on the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse riding in a horse .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports people brought the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala dinner at the Golden Sports pyramid .
it didn &apos;t want to get a pleasant athletes at the time of awards .
Bundes@@ champi@@ oning , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already cleared him .
long is the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award is very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for they will not only award for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
since decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 more outstanding sports cars , the two times US mast winners was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
for the previously recorded athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ dium , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the owner of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ b the hand@@ piece of the Erhard .
many of these sports le@@ aning were come on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part of the illustri@@ ous society the illustri@@ ous society went to the show , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the major animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and trade agreement T@@ TP , this would like Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , one of the two US presidential elections were at the tax and energy policy as well as in one of the basic demand .
the differences in economic policies between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophi@@ cal difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump is rather small to keep in doubt about it , as the state of economy could harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton said to death the economy to death and death , he says .
in contrast , he himself would be quite differently , claims .
he will return to regulatory measures , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching control group with lower tax rates strongly - for private professionals and companies .
Clinton also says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why the tax would be increased to the ranks , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the infrastructure .
in the fact , tr@@ ump and Clinton is nearly wor@@ ried about .
the democratic candidate , announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
the state investment programme in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy , and are rejected by the nation@@ alist te@@ ap@@ y wings of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , without any internal discussions , we could get a party with internal discussions .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policy .
Tr@@ ump is planning to build coal @-@ fired power plants and the carbon development in the USA again .
oil promotion is also possible to be protected in the protected areas as possible , the Paris climate agreement wants to boost its climate agreement .
Clinton also wants to strengthen renewable energy with their investment program , and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and will create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both .
in the same time , both the US would not want to isol@@ ate international trade isol@@ ating - but just American jobs better .
that should also be paid to be paid by Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
they will increase them to $ 15 per hour .
what is a thing in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says , he will not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps .
on the one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost the economy and citizens , to boost growth .
its critics keep him before , so that the household deficit would only be larger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who require at least of the ranks , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any frozen woman has gained experience with sexual violence . &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who have to escape alone , almost already in everyday life .
if they are arriving in Germany , they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
each has a baby which is most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he gu@@ ed with great eyes in the room .
his mother rigid on the table top .
it is noticeable that they will be observed .
they ch@@ ased shortly and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
it speaks to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is a leader of the Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for women , women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility along with Pro family and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
she was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
males there is no other - also not as visitors .
the exception is one qu@@ man before the door .
&quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say , &quot; every woman who made it here , has made her back on her flight with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men escape because of wars because they are politically pursued because of torture or death , or because their families she told them as a hopes for Europe , &quot; she tells them .
in women there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; many steal out of it , because they don &apos;t see any other places . &quot;
in their home they have made experience with sexual violence , Zw@@ ang@@ an , Hon@@ orary , slavery , or practic@@ ed pro@@ stitution .
this drives them fort .
the flight goes on .
&quot; the tu@@ gs for instance for a bottle of water an sexual act , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , tells evil .
even here , women would often be viewed as min@@ der@@ mati@@ zed and worse than lower in the refugee .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the north north , are trau@@ mati@@ zed , estimates them .
some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so happy to say anything else .
&quot; or she was not enough to speak openly about the living space because the sh@@ am is too large . &quot;
as they often does not help to help , there are more accommodations for them , requires b@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district regi@@ strations are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
at the question if they are using a similar project as in Munich in their in@@ comprehen@@ sion zone , reply to a number of No .
in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are so something in accommodations of governments do not exist .
also in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated from the government , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ franken , there are some shared store@@ ys , or their houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two main accommodations exclusively for women .
also the EP committee on the rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls that women have to be separated from men .
in a study that was published for the committee , it means : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated from men . &quot;
&quot; is missing the privacy or men , women and women together , can cause it to be perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot;
above all the rooms should be separated and accessible for women , is available in the study .
like the women of this protective needs , you can see at the And@@ res , which there is in Munich at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has been spoken , we have a long waiting time , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be easy to make a second house .
Assistance to strike : demand for new labour measures
as a deputy representative of the Assistance , their union was called to talk about new workers &quot; actions in their stri@@ ction to a new contract .
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for the entire Council , approved more labour measures starting in early September .
J@@ DC said that there were Minister for Foreign Affairs , to enter the wor@@ ries concerning the contract .
assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed in July over the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members rejected in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had left &quot; be@@ har@@ r@@ lich quiet@@ ly &quot; that has been rejected that the Treaty was rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of the J@@ DC board , the proposed new contract has to complete the proposed new contract to all marri@@ ages . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today announced a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council for a specific application of the BM@@ A procedure , which began in early September .
the stri@@ ctions led that Assistance , this year has six sm@@ al strike , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the BM@@ A Assistance , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election to the agreed parties of the agreed parties which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote , by 5@@ 4.000 assistant , and medical student , that the contract should be beneficial .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jer@@ emy H@@ unt said that the Treaty of physicians in England would be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a stri@@ e that ended a crisis .
the leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to proc@@ laim the hands and an official mandate for the un@@ official war of the words and economic sanctions during the end of the eight months .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I cannot fail to say that Ankara is to reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but put@@ ins also worked out for his smile , and he was barely heat from himself , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
and in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke repeated his &quot; love &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times .
I couldn &apos;t count any more .
he also said that relationships with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further ahead of the crisis .
on the next day , a paper described that Erdo@@ gan had so far as if it would never happen to happen .
for me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable Kü@@ hle showed that the Russian State of Russia had not forgotten .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fighter lu@@ g@@ ale at the Syrian border with Turkey .
in Moscow in response to the time was w@@ ut@@ ory .
Putin ted out and accused Ankara to be fallen in the back .
the verses was even greater than it was committed by an alleged friend .
the Vet@@ eg@@ re@@ re is difficult to re@@ build it if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media has a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed as the Turks would carry all the guil@@ t .
in contrast , the accus@@ ations of executive officials that Erdoğan &apos;s own family had been benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the country of Syria , which will be controlled from the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he cont@@ ested this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message , that it was time to look back in front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin of the presi@@ dents received the exc@@ use of the President Erdoğan , he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a tru@@ ce is clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan requires all friends which he can get started , after having won the last month a coup d &apos;@@ etat almost his Am@@ tes .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
there are also economic motifs .
Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights , which every year usually takes several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel age and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights will be res@@ um@@ ed again .
they count on a late Dalmati@@ an area of the Mediterranean .
this week , the state @-@ TV cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti in the following manner : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here for long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is based on the west , as it was a response to the attempted hierarch@@ ical movement as a weak response .
to do this , the EU @-@ accession negotiations for accession to the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ sts to draw up the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian State leader won in Ankara with safety for a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the elected state of state .
this is a self @-@ evident for Moscow , that has a self @-@ evident , self @-@ sitting fear of opponents .
the summit in this glorious palace , made by Russia and Turkey , one of how it was once described an analyst in an analyst : two countries that took away from the west , and po@@ or@@ ly treated away from the west .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two still .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow gave the role of a peace treaty in Moscow , but to Russia , Turkey and Turkey .
it could be noted that after nearly three hours on the press conference , both President at the press conference said that they were not the topic of the topic .
the President of Turkey prevented it to answer a question about their differences on answers , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
it is no significant con@@ sensus above , where a common N@@ en@@ ner can be found in Syria .
but after months of hos@@ tility , and in view of the potential of a perfect Dis@@ aster , NATO member and Turkey a Russian fight jet , it &apos;s certainly better to talk about two leaders of state at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland , isn &apos;t available .
according to the CEO of the Bank , R@@ BS , should be reduced more on a back@@ pack role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
in the BBC Scotland , Ross Mc@@ EW@@ AN divided the BBC Scotland that were associated with the Bank R@@ BS with the global ambi@@ tions in the Bank .
the Bank has been di@@ stan@@ sted since eight years ago , when they had to be saved almost eight years ago .
in this time , strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer brands .
they supported the international Sport with millions of pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to see more national brands on the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but is not initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ central headquarters and the stock exchange are at Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will be more importance - Cout@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a tour tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is going to become our investor brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees are employed , as we will now be more on a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS has been on a global brand .
I say now , that we are no global targets , but local objectives .
each of these brands will work in its own con@@ greg@@ ations for something different , and our staff will work under these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will no longer lead the Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing no longer lead , and that it will increase the different brands in its Sport @-@ Spon@@ sor@@ ing region .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of the brands , as we focus on our inside ( we asked ) to make this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board .
it would have been very z@@ yn@@ isch about three years ago , when we said that we would have to be a great bank for our customers .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can use this stamps again , therefore I think that the time has come .

Russian Putin @-@ Chief of Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin accepted his un@@ expect@@ edly on his Chief of Staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov had many years in part of the narrow@@ est confi@@ dant of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old became the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport agency .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin , the Putin is that Putin will be ordered as chairman of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been the representative of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was named after his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
he was born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) that he was followed by the Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Regi@@ ons .
about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of stat@@ ute and checks for the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov are asked to leave his post and to V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the s@@ mil@@ ing faces ?
this step has been made to Moscow .
Sergej Ivan@@ ov worked for a long time in the narrow@@ est confi@@ denti@@ ality of Vladimir Put@@ ins , as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
during a meeting with President Vladimir Putin , which was broadcast in television , both men that the Chief of Staff was placed on his own request .
but despite the income of the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of hierarch@@ ies ?
there is no one no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who had once managed to lead the Russian environmental policy , only once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead a large sc@@ ep@@ sis .
in his remarks on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I was asked to join me in a conversation with me this very complicated post - it might be almost say - inv@@ ading the post four years .
as it turned out , I have been the president of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration since four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , the K@@ GB was appointed Ivan@@ ov in his deputy representative .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he most trusted .
once , Ivan@@ ov had been assumed that Ivan@@ ov could go to the second term of President of Russia , because there would have been a third term coup against the Constitution .
but this item was taken by another , near allies of the allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became a president of three and a half years later .

Queensland &apos;s Cross@@ ing : bridge now covered with fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion Swiss project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queensland &apos;s Cross@@ ing with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four types of the &quot; covers , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
he has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of concrete .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion Swiss project will be completed by May 2017 .
the Minister of Economy Minister Keith Brown welcomed a visit today and was one of the first to come from the land to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queensland &apos;s Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of an engineer of an art of art in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used for this bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the crossing is between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and Brü@@ cken@@ deck one hei@@ r , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge on their place and the final section of the de@@ cks will get to its place in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that all deck is ready to be able to leave the bridge to his seat .
Michael Martin , head of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors , said : &quot; the first version is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the future @-@ looking forward @-@ looking and deep @-@ construction .
following the installation of the last road cut , and in conjunction with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck we had to close the existing gap on the North or country side .
this was reached by bricks of the northern Zub@@ in Bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive , and at the same time very hei@@ r activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approximately 6.000 tons , and with a slope of about 3 % had to be moved .
hei@@ d , as the toler@@ ances where the team has been working , win@@ zig - on each side , they only have some milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything was very good .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have to be lucky with luck in life . &quot;
three men have come to his life , &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck last Friday 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties difficulties in safety , while her boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat in its proximity was turned off , and introduced us the Schli@@ mm@@ est , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; fortunately the strong winds of the boat already are silent except for their range , &quot; added to water , &quot; added to water . &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man passed away in the age of 60 and was found at a bo@@ je without rescue .
they came all of them on board the coastline and were brought back to the rescue station .
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water , were fortunate and still alive .
the boat engine had an emergency stop@@ pl@@ ums , however , however , however , during the boiler of the person , saved the boat by the person .
someone has given up these men today over these men .
badly viol@@ ating - husband on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife attacked and badly damaged .
as the police granted yesterday , the 50 year old had to get the key to the apartment to get his personal things .

this Algeri@@ an subsequently took the sister to his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
they could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore , she went to her life in his house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ li@@ fel@@ ine of the man .
when the two women moved again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old became his sister to side and hold his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building build @-@ priced apartments ?
the SPD and greetings to my : investors will continue to be profitable much stronger in the future .
how to respond to the bad news that Braunschweig in the next few years will lose almost 1300 in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes the next R@@ ats@@ session a &quot; Dec@@ ision Concept &quot; concept .
however , war is programmed .
in the first line it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the favourable apartments ?
so far , it is missing .
SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; we want to build us with the Green Party , who wants to build 20 percent of all apartments as a soci@@ alizing . &quot;
however , the affordable apartments can also be found in the stock .
but the great number of armed forces at the City Hall , however , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; how is going to build investors coming on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors in such surfaces , at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments have been a soci@@ alizing . &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions and will have to be financed even for suits .
the problem , such bro@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few regulations .
the left is still hardness for investors .
effective whose , viol@@ mann , k@@ ah@@ ne is a forced disappearance of the situation on the residential market .
the concept of action will be implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but still the program is not fully fully : for the around 12@@ 60 new apartments that are supposed to be built .
how to get the loss of other around 1300 affordable apartments that will run out in the next few years ?
until 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the plan@@ etary speakers of Nicole Palm , should now be submitted to the ongoing bin@@ ation of the city .
in addition , we would have to be thought back to the price again .
this is possible in the western town .
solve the problem .
for the end of the year , there will be Fri@@ sten from the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could take you back to the price for cheap apartments .
only : this is the owner , the residential companies is not .
for this , the number of soci@@ alists in the West town has increased dras@@ tically , removed from the objective of so @-@ called mixture .
a concentration of social weak in just a few cities should not be more .
Gre@@ ens expect that the Gre@@ ens will be able to enter the discussion on the discussion .
group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ schke believes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
that is focused on more sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise is found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , who are worth buying
it is a fascinating one , how the world has changed .
that teen@@ ager and child does not want to move away from outside , but rather would prefer to spend their free time to work on screens , was killed in the final decade of many .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and to be active .
at first , the time on the screen was initially limited on the television , then on video card and most recently on smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn that is based on the characters which initially developed to the characters in the 1990s ( later created a flash series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of Pop@@ culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postp@@ oned due to the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
in less days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it works ?
in short , the player can follow with their smart phones , and are searching for Pok@@ é@@ mons , who are tra@@ ced with a GPS if once found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the w@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
car@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , who was recently followed by Washington Post recently , that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of women followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes , by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company knows what Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it looks only the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; up to 30 minutes , &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day are active to see ears because many public em@@ b@@ assies are getting boring , and many people come to come from people who look back .
nevertheless , the meaning of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly make sports drives , reduces his chances to develop cancer or depression .
physical exercise exercise helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to start it here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that the people brings to do something to do something , making them fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
as always , there are also m@@ apped game , which must always be compl@@ ain about anything else .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should be ?
it has a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit already could follow our activity , they gave us any reason to push the sport , as it does this game .
the New will lose its maturity and the use will be re@@ tra@@ ced with the time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons , however , there will be more games to be able to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world , and many people are helping to help hunting , sp@@ litter , and locked up .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynami@@ cally at the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly at the beams .
stunning on the floor .
on the whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ om@@ m was the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the wrong range of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver me@@ da@@ zzling syndrome and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ers &quot; in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the sulph@@ ur@@ sor during the solo struggle for women in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual , who won a multi @-@ winning title , and a total of all the fifth , while they finished their reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke in tears in tears , when her final result was shown and its long journey took place at this moment .
this success provides them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ ere , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es won the last three years of art , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with amazing exercises that the Olympic champion in 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue from her said that she was &quot; the best Tur@@ ner@@ in &quot; I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
they expected to be a last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athlete , but rather between her and a last @-@ dimensional expectations .
not return to a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the Americans are of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , after they have won gold and silver in individual multi @-@ fight campaign of women in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medals in Tuesday , while at the f@@ arewell celebration , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as ex@@ cl@@ amation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during their long road to the top that have never planned the future , is not really true .
one part of their soil exercises - the typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is situated on Latin American music , at home outside of the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents and was adopted by train@@ ee Aim@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans . she was discovered during a school hall in the Bo@@ or@@ man , where Bo@@ or@@ man was ordained .
for the summer of 2013 , she has lost his competition competition more , a Sie@@ ges@@ e series that will stick to such a long time , as it is possible .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina has slightly led by two scripts , the picture shown .
sulph@@ ur beams and floor coverings - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - lau@@ ed .
they returned again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig beams - and sat down with an 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man tor@@ te she gently pressed their En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears made on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that once described once in their collective book , in reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ man was a ra@@ che for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Mu@@ j@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man &apos;s capital is named by the American &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their soil , they threw down the audience in Ku@@ com@@ eback , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes has a com@@ eback appeared .
as far as Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in series production at the music heard in the car .
according to the police report that were killed on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls are shot and killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in a decade since a decade of Phoenix , while they sat in the car and music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was shot in a trip , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ rators &quot; fired up eight shots from a hand@@ held weapon , while he stood on the front page of the car , and then ran with another vehicle , the report is read in the report .
the police divided the police in murder that they do not have been the result of a smokers who seems to have been the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of an adult victims .
the police of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting of the investig@@ ator led to the investig@@ ator , an immediate view to be associated with four previous attacks .
overall , mainly in h@@ is@@ pan@@ ischen living quarters , in nine attacks seven out of seven attacks and two were injured .
&quot; it happens in a living quarters in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ llac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators , evidence of evidence revealed that they have led to the conclusion that they are linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was in@@ stituted by her injuries and died later .
liners , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for it , in an isolated car to sit and music .
the authorities published also a police report on the shooting of the shooting of a empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder , and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the series .
investigations found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and supervised a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl with micro @-@ zep@@ ool : &quot; it is better &quot;
as most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the S@@ ingen , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his aging has Edmund Micro@@ zep@@ ool , the result of a genetic defect , about the mother of Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home , my first thought was my first thought , I did not work .
I didn &apos;t make this .
I don &apos;t have left me .
what really isn &apos;t true -- of course , one has left to be left . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund she will never be seen under circumstances and that he may not survive once again .
some physicians went so far that they pit@@ ched to institutional him .
&quot; my first response was &quot; I knew that the people still wanted to make &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund may run with the help of a pav@@ ements .
Edmund could not yet speak yet to his third , neither sit still cra@@ w@@ ling and it is still not able to speak .
but he makes slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he loves it , with his two brothers , and sing to sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language which Edmund for &quot; Please look something &quot; before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is no typical drawing language -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ bic@@ eps has a wide range of causes : genetic such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ks or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly vary .
it is still too early to say , as it will affect the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus In@@ k .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to commemor@@ ates the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t really know it .
I haven &apos;t been asked for a long time since long time , because I did not expect to say that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ pers rating for mothers with birth defects that caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and love your child will love you .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie .
this is what I used to me under the women &apos;s ol@@ ympi@@ ad in Tur@@ ning , and that is from more than one reason .
first I was in 1984 at every Summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ed , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &apos;s &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , that insp@@ ire for many young girls of other skin .
the structure of this team , which is A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ew and Madison Ko@@ ński , Cath@@ o@@ lics , is round out every proud .
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has made the black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of these sports art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female tur@@ ists in an Af@@ ro @-@ Americans .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympic @-@ win@@ ches and the Americas .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but rather master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual Americans who won gold medal at a individual majority of events for women gold .
Mann@@ i member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we will experience the top of this sports art , but they can &apos;t see gym classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie over@@ took all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic Games have only four wheels in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as train@@ ee .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ning a more expensive sport and Turner in the first line of private gym , which are exciting for training , entry , competition , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these gym are situated in a wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses , Turner will receive its complete training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
Aim@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have started their athletes with their athletes ever since .
we have to be inspired by the communities Au@@ n countless , young girls who will be inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a friendly and easier access .
I founded my Turn@@ Foundation for 20 years .
in my events we have free and affordable Tur@@ ning in Harlem for over 15,000 displaced young people ( mostly black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic ) , and national and international winner .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) , to provide the youth high @-@ quality tower , offering the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen has developed strength , flexibility and coordination to the body as well as hard work , discipline and destination for the spirit .
this combination offers li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health and professional success as well as for education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who are thousands of young girls to be interested , and this is great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is a so exciting time .
thank Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ mes of the Olympic team , thank you for many young girls with different background to start their way to healthy , healthy , strong , and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organize other strikes after they had rejected Jer@@ emy H@@ unt sugges@@ tion
the Minister had been hoping to end the fight against the amend@@ ment of the British Medical Association to end up 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants , who were able to vote on him .
in July , H@@ unt plans revealed the contract to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS would be carried out in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any other delay for the people and patients were harmful .
the first assistant , to get a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekends to improve the care of the number of times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the leader of the BM@@ A Com@@ mittees for assistant , divided his last night in a message with : &quot; Assistance to the proposed Treaty , especially that there is the current staff of the crisis , and it is possible to treat all physicians to do so . &quot;
at just eight weeks , that still remains the first group of physicians under the new contract , the first group must be made , and the time is running out .

culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness can be blo@@ om in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk for Rah@@ man was arrested last year on the occasion of a government report because of corruption from the office .
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the most common election in Muslim communities , are ignored like a non @-@ governmental government report today .
the former member of Sir Eric Pic@@ les is verb@@ al the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ ts to have evidence of election abuse by &quot; survivors of &quot; &quot; &quot; and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and communal government , who is now a rec@@ ti@@ tion@@ ist of vot@@ ers , said that the police should be allowed to protect the police outside of elect@@ ret ( elect@@ oral elect@@ orate ) in order to protect vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should cause a reference to prove their identity in order to prove their identity .
at the moment , a vot@@ ers must call its name and instructions .
the report suggests , not removable ink on the fingers of a person , if they enter the election , in order to prevent someone twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , Sir Eric .
he calls for the press has to be more access to the municipal documents and decisions of not the official comm@@ union or work groups .
&quot; this is not only subject to elect@@ oral fraud , but also the municipal government before the broader cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial support , which means that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election in the eastern part of London .
last year , a Special Court of Justice decided that the am@@ bition of Leut@@ ini@@ que decided to cor@@ rup@@ ted the L@@ itan@@ ei to cor@@ rup@@ ted and illegal practices of its ampl@@ itu@@ des .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have killed the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on z@@ yn@@ ische Art and said that he would have brought his critics with Rass@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bic policies for silence .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that there is the reli@@ ev@@ ous duty of Muslims who were to el@@ ect him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either a person or follow a follow @-@ up when one person chose a person as a person .
Sir Eric said that it should be in the whole country of evidence for fraud .
he vo@@ iced out particularly al@@ arm@@ ing to the frau@@ dul@@ ently letters - at the older members of the Muslim community , to people who were able to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the elect@@ oral system , including the anten@@ nas in order to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as proof that pressure on protection needs of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people to choose according to the welcome of the El@@ der , especially communities with Pakist@@ ani or ban@@ quets .
&quot; there were aware that ... state institutions such a behavior due to &quot; political and religion &quot; reports on political and religion that would be ignored . &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the pro@@ hibition to stop political activists of correspondence chess , to stop &quot; elect@@ ors . &quot;
the report , which is dra@@ gged by Ther@@ esa May , has also requires tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the elect@@ oral directory on Im@@ mi@@ gra@@ tions and social security check .
add options into account , vot@@ ers can ask the choice before your selection .
non removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as they released their voice , in order to prevent someone twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person , to ensure that they are eligible to eligible for them .
a three @-@ year @-@ old limitation on an automatic cover election .
ban , ban on political activists complete the letter of letters by letter sel@@ ections .
the police give birth to a election @-@ one stations .
an amend@@ ment to facilit@@ ating an indictment due to the repression of the repression of the People Act of 1983 ( Pe@@ oples Act 1983 ) .
Fot@@ ografi@@ er@@ ban on elect@@ oral stations .
requirement must only be used in the elect@@ oral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ fication of the training , ensure that the employees could prevail that vot@@ ers go on the elect@@ oral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amaz@@ ingly , &quot; that after the Tower of Ham@@ lets case no criminal display .
&quot; the elect@@ oral Commission has declared Lut@@ sk to Rah@@ man and his deputy to cor@@ rup@@ ted and illegal practices , saying , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty of a number of reasons for reason - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the efficient &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controversial controls &quot; of the elect@@ oral session of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court decision in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country carries a proud heritage , but the wor@@ shi@@ fted and covered spread of elect@@ oral fraud and leu@@ gn@@ ation of some authorities threatened this good reputation .

but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is not the only one of the only one who batt@@ ling his own famous Doppel@@ gänger who , at least , if one should give the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio , and all the famous faces , which are at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists at Olympic Games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holland .
the h@@ unter and Wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery of Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates double @-@ singer on the cycling racer many people in the internet on the internet , like a certain bow cont@@ actor of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in the arch@@ ery of Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has got a spin on Twitter as pictures , on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in@@ secretly .
in fact , the arch@@ orer was in the social media with and made it to hear that he has already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I don &apos;t see a great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair@@ ar@@ ung , &quot; Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; he is a fine @-@ looking guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular verses since London 2012 will undoubtedly be a focus of interest : the simil@@ arity simil@@ arity between the British Virgin Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the beloved Ac@@ tor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with its big , expressive eyes should be considered double @-@ speaking for the Cuban singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .

strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter User was very happy to look like the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user there is for the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares maybe a reason
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained its satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet should consider that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact the US @-@ football solo solo works and the D@@ ex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .

the network was too fast and gave a message out .
we regre@@ t it correctly that these statements were made , and that it was possible to broadcast them .
we stayed yesterday night quickly with our spectators to broadcast and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n among the social media .
to make one clear@@ ances , By@@ ron comments related to the performance of the swimming pool , and not on them as person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and a un@@ fortunate formulation . Byron does the what he said , very tired .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the programme and tried to justify his remarks by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to me for the comment I made it for the C@@ BC Olympic Games in the C@@ BC Olympic Games , he said .

buyer in Pri@@ mark is disturbed by Mrs. , the middle of the business in the business sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark , try to try sub@@ titles .
to hide the situation , they knew how they saw it , and put it back to the shelf .
she further bre@@ w@@ ed and pro@@ bi@@ ated four pair of sub@@ p@@ ants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ stone , right .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ stone , where the woman put the under@@ p@@ ants before they put back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the shop , said that the mysterious death had promised the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and left the business without any order . &quot;
they said , &quot; The people could not believe that they saw . &quot;
she took part in the middle of the sales area , they took a pair of sub@@ titles from the emi@@ rate , with@@ drew its own strings and trousers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not find a somewhat discre@@ te place to do it - she was simply as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; every star@@ ed , when they with@@ drew the sub@@ p@@ ants once again , that ye do not have fallen back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other sub@@ titles before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t know it , again , and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed not to be irrit@@ ated that someone might be observed - or about the person , who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants that they had temp@@ ted them . &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in Kent , said : &quot; how to imagine that someone had any other person who had not had any other person , who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the staff is trying to drag the clothing pieces from the sale when she went - what is equally good . &quot;
&quot; I would be h@@ assen , with a new pair of sub@@ missions to the house , and to figure out that another woman had made them , and they had not been washed out . &quot;
a speaker from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the privil@@ ege to be aware on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to do it with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms .
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him something more saf@@ er .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to figure out how to find out with armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you can get back from front or rear , you will show this video how to turn your rob@@ ber .
if you &apos;re looking forward to you back from the back , then you should see that you can see your anxiety and go out from the Schengen Convention , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder , before you beat him with your free el@@ bow into the face .
beat him with the knees and turn it into the bodies , while the anxiety and sli@@ des@@ people , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face , and move forward to him when they perform the gun on him .
with an attack@@ er , in front of the front , the technology is similar to your body - move your body from the car@@ ou@@ line , take the gun , and turn them , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
store the weight on the gun and beat the bre@@ asts on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle , before they move back and put the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
see the video to see exactly as it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but do you think that in a Rau@@ b , you should make your money at a smoking , unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel to Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the towns of Europe
a British travel went to the immune system and saus@@ age of a serious test - by putting some of the worst and most famous places of Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his move on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing head of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to make the resistance of its immune system under proof .
before departure of each property , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show , and let us know what it will be .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th , &quot; brought some surprising results of the daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ed head of a train toilet , which was used by thousands of others , may be completely shock , but actually are in a kitchen sp@@ inning le more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright answered with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ more and more than its own health .
fortunately , nothing , what he warned , more than a bad back@@ pack in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his ten@@ ms by adding the world , and ate as well as wonderful things .
from public transport to railway stations up to dish@@ wah@@ er of toilets , the task offered his immune system definitely below one sample
in the film , he told : &quot; already a child was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health affects my health and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , saus@@ ages and Schl@@ amm@@ water . &quot;
in the film he was asked to meet its reputation for any case .
the only thing he insi@@ sted , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ pul@@ line showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison with this , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ er@@ ation number freshly washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refused after their lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have a less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dated the rice il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ in different places like the bathroom .
in the film he says : &quot; this comes to the worst , which I have left in a toilet , close . &quot;
there are nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;ll have nothing an@@ le@@ cken here , because it is dr@@ unk here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner St@@ reng@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the company fin@@ et Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which also contains a vitamin C and D , also contains vitamin C and D , to support the promotion of Dar@@ mb@@ more and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ mer@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to make the consumers really something new .
something , the fascinating one , which is a fascinating and at the same time , the benefits of Pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we are crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming through which so that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in Darmstadt health is being a global phenomenon .
instead of only about the products , we wanted to imagine them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system .
growing interest in Darmstadt health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary , we were able to provide further information on an interesting kind and way .
I think that the film shows that we have a great sense for hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the Director of the film , added : &quot; let my respect for Ian , if he would have lost some of the things , I have made it all things , like the Russian Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things to do in which it was simple , Ian to bring it to le@@ cken and others , where this was quite difficult .
I am happy that we have recorded some of these dirty bl@@ ings on film . &quot;
in a vali@@ dated survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of those surve@@ yed lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent stated that they are at least sometimes products that included Mil@@ an@@ tic acid .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate Soci@@ o in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their soci@@ alists after a delay of £ 50,000 because they had responded to their neighbours .
Tan@@ ya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ isi were thrown after a long list of complaints by their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from her property , sho@@ cked staff of the residential cooperative had been the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls abol@@ ished , wood@@ working holes were torn down , gar@@ bage , gar@@ ner@@ ed on the ground floor and gra@@ ffiti on the walls .
the family have been moved and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation .
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they do not fear that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; It was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare , and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is thought to be considered as a beautiful part of Corn@@ elius .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terrorist that had added the family had been added with bases , drug abuse , drug addi@@ ctions , drug addi@@ ction , drug addi@@ ction , drug addi@@ ction .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement of anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found .
have been tra@@ ded in the estate , which were tra@@ ded in the past drugs , which were sc@@ anned in the past .
neighbours said that they saw them on the road and had to fight regularly the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ mit it , and their partners are violent by the property , after they gave them a prolon@@ ged deadline of 11 weeks to sur@@ rendered voluntarily .
the dol@@ o@@ gi@@ sts have been che@@ ered by capit@@ ated neighbours , said that her life was made in hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they gra@@ bbed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times , which we can tell the police , are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet - that &apos;s not so quiet !
now , where they are finally away , it will be nicely .
Adam Fitz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ ese En@@ forcement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that there was the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was launched in regular intervals , 20 years old .
on the out@@ pac@@ ed side of the municipal house , gar@@ bage , and old toys .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the Mi@@ eter was able to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult , and its deeds for their neighbours terrible .
I guess all the work , my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have gone down to us , and have made the information to you .
I hope that this development is a few neighbors , and the message is conve@@ yed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated .
Fitz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which lie down in one of the bedroom of the house according to the dol@@ o@@ gi@@ ate on the ground .
in the house of the house of the house of the house , the house is surrounded by the house .
in 2014 , police led a raid in the house and took over 70@@ g cannabis and orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in height of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of fine , after they found himself guilty of a drug of the class B in commercial view .
in 1982 , she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to an auto fall in 2013 .
having been living without Ob@@ dach , it is assumed that Tan@@ ya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ymouth .
many of the walls of the house were lubri@@ cated with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will keep Mi@@ eter del@@ im@@ ung@@ ed to the house order .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall divided a clear warning to the other mi@@ eter that keep not to the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can take place without self @-@ enabled , as well as those who were written by such a behavior , &quot; she said .
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall is never inten@@ tional and anti @-@ social behaviour , who continue to work together with partners to protect our communities .

Turkey : the Kur@@ dish municipality are reck@@ oned with mass flow
&quot; who doesn &apos;t worry , and Erdo@@ gan only sits on ge@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed caffeine , &quot; says the cent@@ ration of the vali@@ ant @-@ based foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany is reck@@ oned with ten thousands of protection looking from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; believes the Association of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard practice of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan to Germany , the Kur@@ dish Municipality of Germany expects mass flow to Germany .
in a short term , I went with tens of thousands of thousands , medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan regime was fought and the democratic Left Opposition , &quot; says the Association leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already moved up a couple of k@@ bur@@ gen with stra@@ tion@@ aries to run 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the escape .
after the failed coup d &apos;@@ men still saw sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
many are re @-@ up in Europe if they are re@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it may not be that a state which , even refugees , is , in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the Order of Malta accused the targeted candidate of sy@@ r@@ an Arab in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
thus , Erdo@@ gan of Erdo@@ gan to the remaining Kurds would increase the remaining Kurds in the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians , and Greeks , were sold already in the last hundred years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Order of Malta demanded that the German government has claimed &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot;
in Germany , there is also a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ ase &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic .
I don &apos;t feel safe in the last months for the first time .
the German branch of the vali@@ ant movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire mark@@ ings as sl@@ ur@@ ry , destroyed , and other acade@@ mics have been the professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t worry , and Erdo@@ gan only sits on ge@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the vali@@ ant @-@ foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper published on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture , the Turks had already been the largest group of political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as early as June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people have been recognized and thus recognized almost 29 percent of all as as@@ ynchron@@ ous ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey it does not find the war before war , poverty , or lack of wealth .
questioned on asylum in the Basic Law , only politically , i.e. , by state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ law .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then we go to do it . &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals got nothing from the summer elections with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they were understood .
by 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for little more than so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and landing .
the locals , which are convinced by the elect@@ oral struggle , are on holiday .
most of the tourists who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hi@@ d@@ den@@ see , are not a locals , not for the country day .
to do this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ per , depend for posters , air bal@@ lo@@ ons , and at the end of the vote , only ar@@ ev@@ oked .
until September 4 , 2016 , the elect@@ oral and final day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern had to pass over again on the people over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can &apos;t say that at all , it has just started .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be fear for office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is clear clearly behind the CD@@ U .
the excitement is exciting , such as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D , and what remains at the end of coalition d@@ well@@ ings .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and since 2008 , leader , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , one sees his grand@@ badge .
he travels through the land , distributed by Ros@@ es and ch@@ ateau a little with the people , as it was also his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , sailors and cold feet get cold feet and gives his guil@@ t at the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , her &quot; We create &quot; the ascent of the right @-@ round lists , which will probably now cost the beautiful post office .
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced , as it is , if you get to the wrong time at the right place .
she has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to grandfather , Angela Merkel in the northeast .
but the target group voted not , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as the Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but there was a pity anyone who had to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Northern Irish CD@@ U is mostly largely to the usual elections on market places and shopping centers with deck@@ chairs and air bal@@ lo@@ ons .
that , in addition , Kok@@ ert is only one &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union also reported that their land is based on the basis of the basis , that it has to be very strict rigor@@ ously to the people again .
it is like the Lef@@ ts , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the country of the country hardly exist .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U &apos;s elect@@ oral def@@ aul@@ ts to its competitors , but you will need to do , where people are h@@ unters , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden marri@@ ages , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called Sell@@ ering up to a particularly aggressive election campaign .
in p@@ olls the Euro MP@@ s most recently with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election the SPD gained clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Small Party , with seven percent in the surveys , will create the jump to the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern Tu@@ es@@ ome , and lay out their elect@@ oral campaign of the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls the state director Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elect@@ oral batt@@ ling out on track c@@ ater to local voices under the holiday .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house boat by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ ic lakes and is still nice .
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no sentence . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : eating places suffer under Sper@@ ing
at the speed of speed , which will be refurb@@ ished with the B 27 , there is nothing to m@@ eck@@ ed .
for the developers of the construction work , which will start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are common@@ praise .
&quot; we made everything rather soft , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the Jet gas station .
this is a Super@@ team .
there is also no deteri@@ oration .
the building site could be moved to the half @-@ time planned to the South , until the end of October , everything should be finished .
the contrary is also praised to get to the work of the construction work , such as it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el segments .
since the building site on Monday to the south , and also the Sper@@ ing of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and also again the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , has relax@@ es the traffic location within the place .
citizens can now run from Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides back on both sides .
the transfer to go through the place seems to be returning through the town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible for the transport management of the renovation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had sought to fight with more traffic noise because many Schl@@ eich@@ ers were sought and rather than their Nav@@ i trust in the sign@@ age .
what led to that he resp@@ ecting trucks in residential areas .
since the speed limit did not have been observed , the church demanded the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant changes , &quot; says King , who herself made himself about the location even before the location .
there are already two to three per minute .
the high @-@ speed limit was 77 @-@ hour zone with 77 @-@ hour zone .
since its construction work has been moved , but it has become a quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ st that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg and now it is open to the street .
in the maps , they don &apos;t have to look for business@@ men .
but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment of them has led to sales , everyone you ask , we look back .
however , some more and some less affected are affected .
who has to do with the &quot; End@@ ress &quot; less to do , i.e. for other companies , for which the refurb@@ ishment has hardly any consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er speaks Thomas Sul@@ z , one of a &quot; most slight decline . &quot; he is also one that , of course , &quot; the running of course is missing . &quot;
most are exploited are the Local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is exist@@ ent .
not only him , but all guest places have hit &quot; hard . &quot;
it lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy with every Euro turnover .
the sales revenues will be more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street dispat@@ ching had returned its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he is supposed to have been dismissed for half of his staff .
if I would have been a company with 4000 employees , and half of it would be released , the policy should be different .
instead , the president Jörg Schmidt , on a request of G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER , if it might have a financial statements , otherwise the benefits of the B 27 will also need to have the re@@ parts that indicate the renovation of the renovation result .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous .
with all cl@@ agen , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER is confident that its guest will exist .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
other tribal guests now can now understand because of the complicated traffic management , it is possible to understand .
if you don &apos;t travel , it is also very nice .
in the end of the reconstruction work , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER no doubt has no doubt about any doubt .
despite the BSE with BSE and bird gri@@ ppe , G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER keeps the impact of the B 27 construction works on his client@@ ele , the biggest crisis that its host is in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that is already brut@@ ally .
constantly , in the name of the terrorist control of laws .
after the recent attacks , the Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thi@@ er safety package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status with terror ?
and what was the coalition partner to all of the ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ öh@@ ner .
all his proposals are to be donated to the coalition partner &quot; politically zum@@ ut@@ able , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security press .
you should not require anyone .
others , further points would be discussed within the parties .
I also saw me with me .
as the Minister of the Interior , let him account for him , and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , a little time before he will present his conclusions about the safety in the Republic .
this , however , the most extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced that a new security agency is to take care of the Kn@@ u@@ en@@ code communication , is not new .
also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on flight data and arms law .
the call for more video monitoring and staff for security authorities are also not surprising .
for a part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals to do so with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ isers for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double @-@ citizenship in the German Pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man is one of the most difficult points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless I get this still for zum@@ ut@@ bar and challenging nothing to do with the coalition partner . no more chances have .
a few new ideas will be presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
there are some partly in itself : he plans to process quick procedures for sle@@ eves and more possibilities for cont@@ ingent of people in front of deportation .
refugees who are to be picked up in the country , are supposed to leave their smart phones and social media Ac@@ counts for security check .
for more than ever , asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to do some worse than so far - such that Stra@@ ft@@ ates or their papers are going to be aware , to wear their identity .
some of them is politically and legally hei@@ r .
man@@ ches also works even un@@ locked and can be open to any questions .
and in some points - in the im@@ ine@@ ating treatment of patient , the question : what does not do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to enter the issues between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it &apos;s not possible to speak in speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
there were also many people in view of the high refugee camps around the security .
and things that were able to deep@@ ened the people , even in competition times are not cl@@ amps .
the inner safety is enorm@@ ously high in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
great safegu@@ arding is big .
yes , it can be fin@@ alised .
Union and the SPD are thus increasing the inner security and increasingly in position .
in the last days there went between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the police , then over a security policy of some uni@@ ons of the Interior , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ex is also a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a return from double nationality .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère m@@ bled here to con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return to the double pass .
we met the discussion in Germany .
you &apos;re newly founded , isn &apos;t sensible .
and in a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he is constitutional .
whether its own package is in all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; zum@@ ut@@ eable , &quot; the coalition partner , must be still present .
it is a lot of it , what could cause to fight .
however , the SPD is currently tried to pro@@ hibition on the subject of inner security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized it to be careful to say , saying , &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helped security further . &quot;
Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p is still in Volkswagen .
despite diesel fuel than rise the worldwide analysis worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
during the feedback action there is host to a term .
Volkswagen starts with deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
in the previous year &apos;s largest motor@@ ways in Europe despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , it is possible to continue an increase in the previous year .
however , in July , the core brand VW , mainly in Western Europe and projected again to the total sales , as which is listed in the D@@ ax company .
worldwide , VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars will be selling 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries by almost one sixth .
the Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the we@@ aker numbers in Europe on two sales days less in Europe .
in some nuclear markets , there was also to be changed by &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey also explained the British vote for the exit from the EU , explained a spokesperson .
in the United States , where the exhaust aff@@ inity is at first , the city is also a Min@@ us .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony goes further on by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months an delivery of minus 0.9 percent is to be reduced to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
in January until July , Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to increase sales growth from January to July .
more than 1.3 per cent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software package .
in Germany alone , VW , around 2.5 million cars , calls for re@@ arm@@ ament to the workshops .
in the course of the upgrade , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
according to the upgrade of the vehicles it will give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance no deteri@@ oration .
the bus point to the customer , after upgra@@ ding a &quot; guaranteed &quot; guarantee , &quot; but not by a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company .
legal entities are legal entities .
the &quot; Focus , &quot; reports , Volkswagen granted his German customers now , yet a guarantee for converting diesel models .
this was confirmed last Monday by VW @-@ Represent@@ atives to the Federal Ministry of Justice .
the Ministry of Justice has been confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; VW has produced the editions of my In@@ qu@@ iry Commission and the KBA complete success . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Government of Alexander Dob@@ rin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine performance after dis@@ arm@@ ament no deteri@@ or@@ ations and all typical of the relevant vehicle values have been unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in business trips .
in the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen have the opportunity to upgrade that , for example , half a year after upgra@@ ding a workshop in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage does not do anything .
also in customer inter@@ mitt@@ ance , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage caused by any other damage , that &apos;s nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ sc@@ andal that comes to a failure regarding possible guarantee , as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires criminal cases as a second institute in Germany as a second institute in Germany .
ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers who have 40 million euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily asset items &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single incident . it &apos;s no signal : normal spar@@ er would have to be afraid to pay for their austerity criminal cases . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen database G@@ mund from September of Private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to Gi@@ ro@@ - or Day .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euro a year , &quot; said Paul .
he has been around 40 million euros that could be raised from a day on the other and could not be saved .
&quot; I lie with me on the central banks and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; said the Bank chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can not put it for each million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost will give it after the principle of the principle .
that cash easily in the Tres@@ ors of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen wouldn &apos;t be much dangerous to dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four over@@ ts , I &apos;m not yet another fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most customers were understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few hikes to other banks .
the Bavarian association Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused significant cost &quot; with all banks . &quot;
it alone to carry alone , &quot; business partners are not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their charges for con@@ tours , credit cards or transfers .
the interest rates for deposits received from three million Euros to the Thurin@@ gian and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen of Alten@@ burg Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private customers have to pay for deposits , to do this competition in Germany under banks and savings banks are too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker testi@@ fied at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; a cli@@ pper that is equipped with a little luxuri@@ ant nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this can be used for a small bank for a small bank , &quot; if they have free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the gen@@ itor bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ mir , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the German folk banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to which Negative over the private customers , is very high , very high . &quot;
the competition was hard , and it dro@@ pping the Im@@ migration of An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .

Dest@@ ination panels : who purchased sound boards ?
all men and medium @-@ sized men .
before you have a commentary for him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym , non @-@ aven@@ ues at the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non Alle@@ sch@@ ema &apos;s age , this testimony leads from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v the multiple emergence of sound boards did not rely on a boom in Millennium Tar@@ get , which would like to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but to the Mid@@ life No@@ stal@@ gie .
those who have recently purchased a plate , are all travel according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able buyer group .
there is also no hormon@@ es by Hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older squ@@ abs leave their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ go@@ v ?
if this blog would follow a news report on TV set , I would follow me , while I was in the middle of a bu@@ stling street in Soh@@ o , a modest pur@@ se , my hands and a little part of what I say , &quot; so let you let us see an immediate view . &quot;
so , let &apos;s look forward to us .
even if the heart of So@@ h@@ os is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the building where independent vendors have been located - there is a handful of fantastic turn@@ tables .
I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to turn off for the next part , in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate her age and vegetables .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am with Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : eight men mean age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) follow , is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector that I do ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 panels .
this record plates , above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by his house ) , where the walls of its housing is furnished .
the reason why he has a great number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy boards , which he was not able to buy , when he was selling young and ple@@ ite again , which he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy the late 60s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I thought to buy a little bit too young to buy it . &quot; he says .
it is true that those who sell plates , rather an extremely intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t eat and drink not much too much .
this is my l@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback in com@@ eback , and to buy the com@@ eback in order to buy their old records .
of the discussions , I have led , people in rule so by 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy your CDs again , &quot; says he says .
that would explain the boom to the record of a certain age .
but what is that of the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record shops has a calm community of equ@@ als .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers who took contact with the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to return to stability of trusted Schall@@ platten@@ , by counter@@ parts , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ hood memories .
&quot; I think it can sometimes be the filling of a Le@@ ere or ownership of material , as a kind of Tro@@ st , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collectors so and I think it is in many people .
it is a simple way to employ a spiritual way .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ es a staff of one record stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a plate a record , they haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the survey found that 41 % have a record players who never use it , while 7 % of those that have a plate , no record players .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very wor@@ ried as I went through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Komp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Uni@@ verse ( data number : three men mean age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy @-@ aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone arrived recently here and said , &quot; I do not have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ cal Schall@@ platte , that I can do it into the shelf . &quot;
this is not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely definitely .
more productive @-@ consuming , less musi@@ kl@@ as@@ tig .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not older that come only slowly .
opp , which has dedicated to the sound board almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , as I used to go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the photos make , teenagers and women &apos;s medium ages .
even if the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing shops - Wild &apos;s latest syn@@ thesi@@ zed pop . instead of experimental jazz , it is good to see such diversity of diversity .
none of them looks very sunny , but brand @-@ psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are badly damaged , if you want to meet someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs since a few minutes in business and considered the variation on for sale plates .
you rather get an Display bum@@ mel than a big buy .
she does not deser@@ ves much , therefore , the collecting is not real option , says it .
it costs plenty of .
it &apos;s easy music from a computer or to listen to other kind , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a lovely s@@ eu@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record @-@ owners have to have inspired : Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the call the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to Mu@@ stern , which I was a group of young teenagers who prefer to buy Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
at the left , a Tre@@ pp@@ house , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , essential panels for an average collection .
no one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to set them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but in view of its attraction , any attraction for these items are going to be more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of So@@ h@@ os for more , there &apos;s nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others , it is the one that is most important for luxury items such as panels .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the great number of women artists and record players that exist in reality , record shops and online shop .
these people are presumably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety , not with the balls from the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while keeping the star@@ render view of an un@@ secret , 30 @-@ year @-@ old anch@@ or@@ ator , that has nothing out of all men &apos;s middle age .

French Court le@@ aning his offer of shops in the jung@@ les of the refugee camp
a French court rejected a French court in Cal@@ ais rejected dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jung@@ les of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in a trial date , the authorities argued that the government should not forget to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp &apos;s goods , from cigarettes to Ener@@ gy@@ drinks , sell home services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be paid out of a parallel economy would be paid out of no tax and a fire @-@ risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important to be important as the free meals that are supported by state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp would offer .
they also led out that the provisional business and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals to people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there are no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had to operate the 72 temporary business , but spatial the concerns of the Cal@@ ais prefecture . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafés and restaurants would play a lot more important role when people live on feed , &quot; which live in extremely pre@@ heated conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting will offer between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ fire , the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des camp was operated and 200 meals on day , English and French classes , as well as a advice to asylum seek@@ ers , accompanied by hundreds of protection .

Germany &apos;s R@@ aser need to adjust the next generation of speed scanner : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new Thunderbolt devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ses are particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used as an accident of accident workers , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example on the Autobahn @-@ site or refurb@@ ishment bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary bub@@ ble to ensure the speed limit .
a permanent mobile structure can be dangerous or dangerous .

eight years ago , they lost every game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .

this loop will we@@ do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of G@@ BS from Sp@@ ass .

the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , when Fiji was born , the 7 was to play , while the GB was still missing .
it is also possible .

behind each Gold , a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ ting hel@@ pers who make up the difference and there was no one of the coach that would not know about 30 months ago , whether he was diagnosed this day at all , when he was diagnosed with him .
he said , He said .
I had bladder cancer who is operated , and the did she did .
if you do not do it , spread all over .
it would have been a pretty narrow situation .
it changed a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had lucky enough to begin with the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , the interrup@@ tions came to a minimum , if that &apos;s under such circumstances has been at all the right term .
I needed money , so I needed to go again better .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran at station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it starts .
the ruin of himself is already a challenge , but that makes it more larger .
in the U@@ tility of the victory , her first thoughts to Williams , who tried to add a ner@@ ed morning so much more than else , and thus tried to process his own change .
St@@ anning , which was a cent@@ uri@@ on in the Royal Arti@@ llery suggested in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps a little bit , but it means that much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked together .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would no one who is a massive Dan@@ ger to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have not have a better person for carrying or better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have been lost in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with whom they could not keep up their opponent .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to close this , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had given much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen cried al@@ b in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get you with it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make it a bit t@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted to get no fire@@ works today , we wanted to get a good result , and we wanted to win the race , which we did too .
the pair will take place for one year before , before the decisions will meet on its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now they will enjoy the moment .
I don &apos;t wanted to say that my last race was last race .
that would have a much pressure means .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic asi@@ t .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity .

steel - Light of the German steel industry
the k@@ ris@@ en@@ beut@@ ated and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains of additional cost at milli@@ on@@ enh@@ öhe .
financial pressures , the sector of the oil @-@ cost @-@ stimulating , are taken from the table .
due to the liberation of renewable energy in the German electricity industry , Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said German Economy Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said : &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really happy about that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had to initially planned , the steel producer , which used gases from the high oven for electricity generation to request for their consumption .
the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , it is now an agreement with the EU Commission following discussions with unfair competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only if the generators can be replaced in the steel frame , each one E@@ EG lev@@ elling from 20 percent .
but this would not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall also welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission to grant its original generation .
thus , the status of the status of the date was largely fixed .
the successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel , Future &apos; is a first step . &quot;
further have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even in Frankfurt , the reform of the emission @-@ rights and employment targets are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant pricing pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to expand as the world &apos;s largest producers in China in view of the we@@ ather@@ ing domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers take delivery price d@@ umping before .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
for example , the fu@@ mi@@ z@@ öl@@ le on import steel effect , have the economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear , how long the price is re@@ covering .
the German branch of Thys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained with the German branch of Thys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp on Thursday .
last , the prices were again stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ sive to the difficult location with further cost reductions .
in Thys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to complete out individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturer , despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
produced with 3.4 million tonnes , six percent less raw materials than in the previous month , like the economic union steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the mass amount now went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates increasing order with increasing demand in the coming months .
community , Spirit , Health : sing the sen@@ iors good
the S@@ ingen has already accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school@@ choir , in Leh@@ man &apos;s school , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is involved in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels isolated , cheer@@ ful , and a total of living live , says it .
in this way , her health and their spirit do something good .
for S@@ ingen is the same as a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior partner League .
most of the sen@@ iors in the choir and share with equ@@ als the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular esc@@ ence , the social contacts can exercise and maintain .
for those often solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to talk and perfectly organize , can rely on the other and another - a choir is a very special form of awareness . &quot;
can sing in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
the sen@@ iors have a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly calls his lung regularly , neither is not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz says from the Federal Employment community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the common S@@ ingen had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz is often observed that the S@@ ingen or hearing of songs in older people have many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song tex@@ te and especially melodies , self @-@ infected people tra@@ ced to a long back @-@ flying events .
in the S@@ ingen the head became a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , simultaneously , on the own voice , and to focus on a given rhythm , and to keep the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one sees by the S@@ ingen in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through the S@@ ingen choir .
himself up to show : if I want to do something for something , I will use better and vulner@@ ability through me - this experience .
good reasons to start with the S@@ ingen , so there &apos;s enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , it should not hesitate to wa@@ ver - even if he writes , little talent :
man does not hesitate to go alone - with 50 sin@@ less people who h@@ ears only if you go a tone beside him ?
on the search for the suitable offer , various ways , says H@@ ac@@ kler says .
someone sings someone of the most famous circle in a senior ench@@ y@@ or , you can easily connect to your name .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs of the environment .
those who like to sing in a church choir , can directly contact the church or the Church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can be found beyond the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors have to ask help with the Internet .
those who want to sing , should be able to use a choir , like h@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul good and has a little bit - that is valid for each age .
cats react sensi@@ bler as a cat on terror on the young .
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which has the impact of cat ab@@ ys to adult animals .
too of their surprise the Mi@@ ans also left the males not cold - but they remained in the difference to the females still .
female cats can recognize the shooting from Katz@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the mouth of the Small .
they react rapidly by ten percent qui@@ cker on Lau@@ te by k@@ itt@@ ens , who found themselves in great need , as scientists from the medical doctor and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cat are also react to the ru@@ fe of k@@ itt@@ ens - but not equal .
&quot; apparently the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the mouth of less and strongly @-@ reg@@ ression for the males either not det@@ ach@@ able or not of significance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first @-@ president of the study that was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C evolution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and the height of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ Schre@@ ie differs in their help .
in total , nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from animal species of the MH@@ H .
you were played for a ru@@ fe by small , which were separated for three minutes from the litter and of mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the other , they were confronted with Schrei@@ en of stronger inter@@ itt@@ ens , which was also advanced in addition .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the terror on the terror . &quot;
you have swi@@ ft@@ ly faster to the speaker , when this ru@@ fe was played by the very che@@ er k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be born or development with sexual activity .
&quot; a surprise that the males responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in baby bottles .
also , some studies show that women are sensitive to babies , even if they were already mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .

the &quot; Democracy Group &quot; on public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan run on Wednesday , Wednesday .
the sports is - like all the country - shar@@ pen@@ ed in supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not counting the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but given the dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coup .
there are even the fans agree - whether you have a heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; gala &quot; will be returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .

as a result , it would not be able to pick up gold , the audience broke into a J@@ ub@@ el@@ iness .
but there are many other athletes who have been going to start the Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in spite of dop@@ ing past .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season , USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann running the Olympic champion in 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than ever , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds , the number one in the world and is considered the biggest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .

a means to the penis enlargement was responsible for penetration .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ head , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athlete , so many medals were also detected .
so , T@@ ich@@ on lost its WM title from 2005 nine years later after the test@@ oster@@ one @-@ Dop@@ ing has been determined .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave the Olympia Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid Dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 due to test@@ oster@@ one abuse .
in 2008 , the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , he obtained a bronze medal at the International Sports Court of Justice in 2008 .
at 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , it is on rank two of the world rankings .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian , injured - Mehr@@ ing dead .
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the wife in contact , said the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early morning .
they were killed , and be treated in the hospital , but have already left again in the hospital .
she started her home booking for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in line with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs .
according to police , a Tha@@ il@@ f was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Lower Saxony and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday , again , two of his ren@@ ditions , once again , according to the authorities , another man was killed .
the Ph@@ uk@@ et also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near tourists near the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong was injured as a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , an additional bomb that killed an urban employees .
the explo@@ sives was according to the authorities in a flower , before the re@@ four of the coastal police have gone into the air .
finally , on Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the Southwest coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast .
let us go from an association with explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was it .
&quot; the bomb attack are the same manuscript , &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday , Friday early journalists .
&quot; we go out that there is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attacks . &quot;
it is to early , to achieve possible mo@@ tive mo@@ tive - probably more likely , however , for the deeds of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media , wanted to detect a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ate Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police , however , explained the attacks of hour@@ ly related to the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only a local sab@@ otage which limits on limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
on the fact , it is believed that the bombs was laid by the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have had in the last few days of confi@@ denti@@ fied references to the southern part of the country - but they are not informed about the exact date and the places were informed .
nor un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks of the attacks .
the police showed its civil servants to strengthen security around important government buildings and airports , stations , tourist attractions , tourist attractions , restaurants and fun town .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not opposed to tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hu@@ mi@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the reason , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , to make the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and its surroundings .
after the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is not necessary travelling to this provinces .
increased security risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unta &apos;s Constitution .
this room has also been an influence of the military &apos;s great influence in the years .
Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said the bomb had been an attempt to overthrow chaos , while the country went to stability , a improvement in economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who in 2014 had come to power in 2014 , himself holds a good idea to have stability and order again .
however , it has also succeeded in the military to get the killing of Muslim men in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
in the conflict more than 6500 people were killed .
almost one year ago in Bangkok at an attack in a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them have killed foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is to the vision of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several steps in the federal government , the constitutional protective effect will also be set under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; for an effort to exchange the free democratic dictatorship , &quot; said constitutional Compl@@ et@@ ine Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .

that is why we are the movement now .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012 .
it applies to &quot; Mul@@ tiv@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity through a foreign identity . &quot;
constitutional sc@@ orer in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identification &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority in the decision to con@@ serve closely with the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where she says , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to talk with adol@@ es@@ cent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
Isla@@ mi@@ sts as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no bet@@ u@@ ary advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is supposed to be emotional .
young people are due in particular .
this is dangerous .
most recently it had been given out of several states , reports about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any insights .
for the constitutional guard the possible contacts of this kind will be relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , changes their objective and changes .
decisive factor is so , if such people have control the impact on the party .
this is no longer recogn@@ is@@ able .
with a look at the significant increase of voting rights and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers , he said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of a new right terrorism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in the past years that it can be the right @-@ finding structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite certain that another ri@@ ster@@ ror@@ less group@@ ings or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ ist Mo@@ tives .
a clear and pan @-@ wide control of jus@@ ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups are in the regional level or in social network .
he wor@@ ried about this , Ma@@ ate said that many of them went to the account of people who had not entered into the right wing in the right wing .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ ras at attacks on asylum accommodation in attacks are not known as crimin@@ als , politically active Stra@@ ft@@ ly or Tra@@ der on the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed before the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts even at the hat , which were perhaps politically un@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , the SPD or left , which , however , have gone through right @-@ wing mo@@ ods . &quot;

fees of charges per cubic meters of waste water from 1 October 2016 on the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ y 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ u / Linden@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 euro ( up to 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2.@@ 18 Euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage fee will then increase by again , if appropriate to increase the application measures .
after an excessive strain , the sewage price will be in Az@@ endorf then at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported in the authori@@ zation of the budget by the Cultural Area Kul@@ mbach showed that for these sewage plants .
thanks to the right @-@ legal basis , Kas@@ endorf is committed to operate the facilities .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh@@ ov@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Linden@@ berg and Zul@@ u have to attack deep pur@@ se .
the deposits increased between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Executive Committee , Herbert Schmidt showed a new pricing of charges for the sewage plant in the market .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over@@ - and under@@ covers from the fore@@ going Kal@@ ult period .
the gravity increases increases Schmidt so that there are low water facilities for all three sewage plants with a very low water intake , which fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution of basic conditions , for example , expenses for repairs of several thousand Euros gra@@ fted .
furthermore , the sewage will be slightly declining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the back @-@ flying Kal@@ ult period , all three plants are not least , due to their age @-@ up and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for cat@@ ers , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ u , Linden@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant , Az@@ endorf had to be replaced with mechanical ventilation system due to a damage .
in the p@@ umping station , the number had to be over@@ taken and over@@ taken almost 20 years of old production facilities . after nearly 20 years of operation the first sep@@ t@@ ings had to be installed , the sep@@ tic tank and an additional ventilation systems needed to be able to keep the water parameters .
Schmidt : &quot; at these extraordinary expenditure , the expenses of foreign trade and maintenance costs are to be taken into account in the new Kal@@ ult period . &quot;
the same applies for electricity costs which were still clearly under the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses clearly proved that at the low water fall in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
this was added , added Schmidt , the market community of big entertainment costs at the sewage plant in the past 20 years .
the situation for the plants will continue to be pre@@ heated to a period of duration , especially because the supply area of the sewage Office of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al can not be expanded by these systems , because it is a further development of the facilities .

military guide , IS@@ IS Secret Services , presents the committee of the Congress
the United States Central Command in relation to the United States Central Command in relation to an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions were allowed in the place , filed a research committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Repub@@ lics of Republican Movement , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret services , reported on the ass@@ ess@@ ments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
the news services offered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , were recorded regularly for terrorism than the actual circumstances in the place , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; published a newspaper article .
&quot; what &apos;s happening in Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer from poor analyses , when bad analyses were present to our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leadership mistake in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct evidence that government @-@ tips have been given under Obama instructions to change reports , as analysts at the pressure of their assign@@ ments , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 there were many CIA press releases , opinions and statements by the Congress clearly positive than the facts , &quot; explained the report . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly announced that a military tribunal in the Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress held from Kansas , in a statement statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 until mid @-@ year 2015 , the tips of the Central Command has changed the post @-@ ordin@@ ated bonds in order to downloaded the risk by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life , after whom had been played by analysts at the manipulation of reports for the Islamic State .
the report released on Thursday , will be completed by detailed effects , while the investigations will be continued during investigations .
in addition , additional investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are in progress through the general inspection of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the News Service Commission released their own insights into force with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com developed a limited trial for the creation of dis@@ sent@@ ing services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest European Demok@@ rat , Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. ship , was announced .
this process , such as a ship , &quot; delayed the publication of civilian reports , &quot; the Mor@@ al among analysts and &quot; was excessive little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. ship and the Democrats announced that no references to a White House , at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st were found in regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in the last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon by the Pentagon by the Pentagon to complaints by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ cher of the Pentagon was given in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not have any reports of Congress that investig@@ ates the investigations of the general inspection .
but he also announced that &quot; experts sometimes have quite some skills on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence Service and Defense Department an controversial discussion of this important issues of the national defense . &quot;
the investigations carried out over the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the debt burden of the last year , however , President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ ors of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret projects concerning the Islam@@ ist state , like a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a correspondence regarding the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts at the time of many analysts at George W.

Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the uprising against the present reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team has asked Mr. Hoo@@ ker to comply with the government &apos;s statement against the Islamic State Court , there were no significant impacts on the financial situation of the terrorist group because this provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation in order to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
this recognition was not published , reported the Times in September .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not among the people who keep their goals in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot;

as always the game played on Saturday , the American women have a surprising pre@@ bel in their success story , four years after winning the last London games at the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .

they missed the Olympic Games in 2008 because they could not qualify for the K@@ ader .
then came the year 2012 , where it was everything for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was a Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the National Team and thus making things to get better for better .
&quot; a culture change , a mental switch and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work around in London , which we now have .
we can ri@@ p the herds of the completely around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a return counter from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed a surprisingly low and maintained the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until when the game took place in their hands .
it carried out a Sprint with the flat ball about the left side , then moved into the middle and lu@@ red the ball around the Americans around a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who until now had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but as well as good is caused by the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins

and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women with di@@ m@@ ples , would have already be sent under these known names that are sent to Prime Time , set up by sponsor@@ ers and chari@@ ots , and it would be a flo@@ ats , Turner or even f@@ echter .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights against gold in the Olympic tramp@@ oline for gold .
the Olympic flame lit not every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised : air pi@@ stes , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always be able to swim and let it be long .
but if I had a modest arguments for my certain favorite in@@ mate , then let me take the attention to the discre@@ te charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ oline jumping already in 2000 has been a Olympic event , the last 16 years ago , it was perceived that many of whom I had asked , I did not know that it is at all at all .
this could also be regional Ign@@ or@@ anz .
although the USA athletes was sent to competition , it has never been a medal in the tramp@@ oline jumping competition and had had a athlete until 2012 , who had managed to win up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians is to divide the prizes for men and the Chinese , and the Can@@ adi@@ ans die for women .
Dong Dong , China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline jumping in the tramp@@ oline jumping is a certain outside environment , some because it &apos;s suitable for the un@@ re@@ conn@@ aissance flight for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a geother@@ mal enthusi@@ ast .
it is humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous quot@@ ations of his never to be s@@ wollen - but also the Gra@@ zie of the Turn@@ ens and diving , which combines two sports that are essentially included .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , as much as &quot; spr@@ ints . &quot;
emerging winner jump on a huge range tramp@@ oline , shooting almost to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of fail@@ ing movements ( rotation , har@@ es and sal@@ tos ) before they are on the feet .
you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Games , following execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes born from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio competition .
the common Olympic Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
me@@ da@@ ill@@ en@@ nia must continue to gold , faster , upwards , and go over , sometimes up to the end , sometimes down to the goal , sometimes down and back , down at the top and down the playground .
it does not only mark the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV transmission also a further pol@@ arity : the world or the Olympic ar@@ ek@@ ord .
the targeted Stre@@ ets is no@@ bel , be@@ ek@@ s@@ worth , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to get even a viewer .
but it is also what I want to look at the case of this games than anything else .
of this , the tramp@@ oline offers an At@@ emp@@ tion .
the V@@ ector of tramp@@ oline Tower is above .
the goal is not the goal .
he or them pr@@ all@@ t , the he@@ avier he@@ avier like an Astron@@ aut , goes down , then down to the top .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ec@@ tic attack on the goal to do not w@@ öl@@ ts into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant rise of time and gravity .
it is so Zen the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the quali@@ fications and final of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Stre@@ aming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday morning also around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will present the final as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who will probably see in general Tum@@ ult .
when the consciousness was not reached by the anxiety and the lenses can be achieved - as the male US Turner according to the Wall Street Journal recently finished - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air , new fan community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ es@@ cent &quot; in Ethiopia , Long A For@@ mer of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , on demand political changes in Ethiopia , are due to violent resistance to the government .
witnesses tell witnesses , that there were a prot@@ otyp@@ ing during the cl@@ ashes of the police in Sh@@ uss@@ ers .
is Ethiopia just trying to break ?
over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid survey of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government appe@@ aled the country and extended to more areas in the last months .
last week thousands of people suffered thousands of people over the streets , and long @-@ lasting political changes .
the answer of the government was according to human rights agencies .
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen were killed and killed in an armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , the videos over the protests , which are presumably taken over the last or early of this year , how security and young people are forced to make a wall against a wall , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demanded an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country , and in the future , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services working closely with the Ethiop@@ ians together to combat terrorist through the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , when at all , get a lot of western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy is expanding in a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new Pend@@ ul@@ um in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia had all other than a model for democracy , human rights organizations have continued to continuously rising repression through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted to the silence .
many have been sent into exile or in prison , or driven into the wilderness by the wilderness .
however , this could change .
&quot; if you press people , and these don &apos;t miss any other options , apart from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the use of the soil , cover with regard to power of the ruling coalition .
after an extensive election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea , a battle about this delicate , cont@@ enti@@ ous line needed in June hundreds of life .
analysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were more or less forced , the turbo @-@ bul@@ lets , and could be armed forces .
several factors explain why feelings of the bit@@ rate after years before the end of H@@ ink@@ öch@@ el@@ ns are to explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government approaches access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , many people are still able to communicate via the internet pro@@ xi@@ es , the conc@@ eal , where they keep up .
several young Ethiop@@ ian announced that they gathered themselves so protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ hard as one of two largest cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ hard as are no natural enemies .
since its prosp@@ ered , the am@@ har@@ as who come from a@@ edi@@ cs mainly Christian high countries , in politics and economics , while they live the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and are living in Flach@@ land areas .
but that doesn &apos;t change this change .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos , the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ dangerous illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tic genius , a man who could remember corners .
analysts say that he was particularly successful in it to take early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special instru@@ ct to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful to opponents .
&quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ break@@ able reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region in the North of Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the South .
analyst say that he did not include the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood .
the last time , in 2005 , the last time , in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to the data from the government , and subsequently by the government , it was stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ on , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time the rest was relatively fast .
development experts in Ethiop@@ ian leaders for its visionary infrastructure , as the new Pend@@ ul@@ um , as well as its meas@@ ur@@ able progress in the poverty line .
but apparently this is not the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the internal conflicts of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month &apos;s prot@@ ect@@ ations in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ an city , by Tig@@ ray , run business , and hatred of the Tig@@ ray is still working in the social media .
analyst says that protests had the United States and other western associations in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently signed that base has closed .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he will not want to break his allies in one more volatile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ emi@@ gration . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declared his asser@@ tion on IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ ism . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to cr@@ ushed his last contro@@ vers@@ y by sending his campaign by decree President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the founder of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously .
to communicate new questions , a new questions concerning the presidential candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he would be able to communicate clear and under@@ stand@@ able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow @-@ stre@@ iter to take up him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the owners position , you have to declare that he could not be afraid .
after having made a clear event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ uman had returned to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton said IS@@ IS .
but in an early mor@@ nings on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical .
the role was in contrast to the previous day , to which Mr. Tr@@ ump in a number of interviews said , he said the peti@@ tioning completely seriously .
as the conservative Radi@@ cal or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump also wanted to we@@ aken the statement by saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to know nothing to know the republi@@ can presidential candidate nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ ass@@ elt down at a lac@@ ed down , while he tried to handle the focus of his campaign due to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped out for economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject .
over Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics Clinton &apos;s suggestions and to higher taxes , and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already been in his defense in the defense of his defense .
at the end of July , he attracted strong criticism of what he told the Russians Mrs. Clin@@ ton E@@ mails , but he stated that &quot; Natural History , &quot; I told the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical . &quot;
this method does not allow to shift the linguistic boundaries in the policy , and then back to demand back .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages can be absorbed by his fans , as they are arriving , and then , as &quot; clear@@ ances &quot; depending on how the response is om@@ itted . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think it is clever enough to keep his testimon@@ ies enough , so that they can be interpreted in different kind and way .
instead of sound to the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has passed an even more sound because its fra@@ fra@@ ctions will have gone back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal , Mar@@ ist , was published on Friday , a guided tour of the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ate statements , he accused him to understand his critics , or understand his testimon@@ ies , or understand his testimony .
but while he strengthened the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sh@@ ear his loy@@ ed fellow @-@ in to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of which , like a prov@@ oking his testimony also like .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ acy , gave great effort to defend women in CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legi@@ time , political comments , saying , Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he asked for the judge of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in that sense , that by Obama IS@@ IS had an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ singing , completely wrong , and therefore it happened , because he went to Iraq .
most of the mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government knew under Obama , who served as Secretary Clinton &apos;s Secretary of State , has allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East and aggres@@ sively under control .
before the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump set his attacks on the media , and threw them to move on each of his words , and went against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , ins@@ ulated &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can not understand it ! . &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats don@@ ors about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps kidn@@ apping a further evidence that he is in@@ appropriate for the Presi@@ dency .
once the price down by the market , Café in Green@@ point is returning to the market .
Ver@@ b Cafe was a foam café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , which was able to pay only cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had a good coffee @-@ service for 15 years .
of course , it was p@@ ou@@ sted by the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , is sold in the form of Cup@@ cakes in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
native bet@@ ting it as last loss in a gent@@ leman town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ena wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a silk store . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it &apos;s also re @-@ fin@@ alised .
a re @-@ owned Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time staff of the old cafés , owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him a customer , money re@@ funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , maintained much in a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he was also experiment@@ ing his experiments .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ations like cap@@ ers and auti@@ auti@@ ful onions .
there are natural dishes .
the café serves not a beer , there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a former power of the elderly .
&quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was a great customer by Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after having been moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after Ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee rose , she told them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that it was on the coffee and at the culture in Ver@@ b , &quot; said they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , they drink again coffee , even if it is on that day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , one of another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long time since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered , always D@@ ass@@ é .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , as a Swiss watch watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to try and bring new ingredients to the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal maintains its usual order , but sometimes he will replace his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he had no p@@ ill out that the Sei@@ fen@@ um has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie . in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is to create a special soap for use with the coffee @-@ fired coffee of the cafes .
&quot; I think we will still go on your offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish , and Rodri@@ guez , he said that he has pre@@ set aside , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a special Saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cool coffee at the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was the main certificate , saying that he was destroyed on the ground when the café completed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt , Wh@@ itt said that the rate of the place as and the best of a new coffee felt like a home environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had to say , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ comp@@ ating food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took up his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
when Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined Deli@@ ver@@ t of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a very modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree , and as dessert is a pl@@ au@@ men@@ pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was a act of culinary solidarity with biological people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard , &quot; Co@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; was one of the Chinese cuisine in the USA , during their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential home of the Lower East Side .
their latest cooperation , &quot; A an@@ gling meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the story of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop to dinner together , a small , schn@@ itz@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District which has been in business since the IP@@ 67 in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh es@@ man with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and mixture .
as the re@@ porter Hack@@ fry , it found the pair of a discussion about the food in the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; plentiful foods were very popular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were earth bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made up of a ingredient and a slightly cheaper , that is pressed .
imagine that lots of pe@@ an@@ uts have to eat so many earth shots , that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E En@@ ste has a comic strip .
&quot; it must set up in the stomach as lead , &quot; said .
in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American budget , especially in rural areas , a all @-@ you Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rock works and it was freshly baked to breakfast , lunch and dinner served .
the Americans were the Americans that went to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; draws on the way to which the country went to country , not to be the s@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , balanced theme , &quot; says Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write . &quot;
similarly , the new budget fraud : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asserole ollen were found to stap@@ le food as a &quot; wonderful way to hide the c@@ asserole dish as &quot; wonderful species , Ess@@ ence , as they were in@@ able to hide the ingredients below one incre@@ mental sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry .
meat , the years of the center of the American kitchen , was transformed into a rare servi@@ ced luxury .
a self @-@ like mix@@ es were tried , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutrient @-@ read@@ iness was given before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared a court made of that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues off : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions into each other .
it was typical for many of the first ch@@ eps .
as never before or since then , household items - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the state of the country &apos;s natural resources .
by exp@@ elling recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , encouraging women to become women &apos;s &quot; household goods &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of the historic treat .
especially tasty are the reports about the government &apos;s answer to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse with its kitchen , he sp@@ elled out like the million heavy man of the world .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen as fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wearing a shop .
he was glori@@ ously realistic @-@ stran@@ ds .
President Roosevelt would probably have committed the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to be asked with his stomach .
as in the book , we described the day of a households with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt , that the White House brought the boring food in Washington but also one of the most severely damaged food in Washington . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to turn right , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country was back on the legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food was applied .
the pair gave in writing to the writing of the book of directors of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ law @-@ in @-@ mother &apos;s wife - for example how they do not take care of food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; you made people really sick . &quot;
there were the wind @-@ exploited .
after the plates were lined by Eis@@ enberg &apos;s &apos; s , they moved and Co@@ e had a dessert , that they were at home , which was at home at home : pl@@ au@@ men@@ ces , the President Roosevelt at noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added it , that there was an extra@@ ordinarily tri@@ ck , modest recipes to miss a nice name .
there was no cur@@ s@@ lit cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water , and cinnamon .
each ved a bit of wild , a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
Co@@ E scored three times a night .
as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ fier he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he continued his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar to his life in Syria .
he ki@@ cked everything to save the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died at a bomb attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian cover group , which according to the Image @-@ Zeitung has never killed around 60,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers have their own life on the game to draw people from bomb houses and to make them the first aid to help people .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the Group : a video for Civil protective , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans of the bright red figure in the grey war of the war .
as a hero he has never seen , said : &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I want to save life , I think God knows that God looks like a mart@@ y@@ rs . &quot;
shortly before Omar itself fell victim a attack against the victims , he had spoken in a video over the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicopter have been subjected to four @-@ bombs at the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlor@@ ite .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
now , &quot; we remove the toxic ves@@ tiges of Bom@@ b , lest it be playing , &quot; cited the picture of his last words before he died .
the kill@@ ers of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rates is nearly 400 years old .
more rarely sight .
Greenland should only come in winter on the surface .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea on board of the research ship S@@ anna into the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is a swimming pool with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic .
Greenland has only been working with 150 years of offspring .
the Greenland expedition at the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it arrives at an average of 1.@@ 220 meters .
only if it gets down to it , the five metre long animal goes on a smooth 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this contra@@ cep@@ tive lifestyle , however , seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen of Copenhagen at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at a Greenland expedition , which might be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; W@@ ahn@@ sense &quot; , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ ick of Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates a world record .
in fact , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist had already been long that Greenland will be stone .
only missing evidence .
Greenland are difficult to observe . finally , they are mainly in the Eis@@ meer , in front of the low density coast of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they have water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , diving in the surface is usually only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle know a little bit .
their time pent@@ emp@@ t reaches out , when they came out six animals with a transmitter .
prey : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed himself .
possibly they hunt them or pat@@ rol on the ground of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and look at the Kad@@ aver that desc@@ ended from higher water layers according to the down@@ sides .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as the head of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 502 was centi@@ meters .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the lens in Ha@@ ie .
this center of eye lin@@ se is already before the birth of the Ha@@ ie , which in which the proteins are not renewed later .
the two smallest Ha@@ ie had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
its birth should therefore be , therefore , in the early 1960s , larger amounts of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere causes a greater amount of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the after@@ mat@@ h of 220 centi@@ meters long , it contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 in the nuclear chamber , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all bigger Greenland branch had in their lens in the normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cos@@ mic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ o showed a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre long Greenland expedition as an age of 335 years , while the Rekord Ha@@ i can be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only got up offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers of the length of a age .
because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters , probably due to the threshold of sexual activity , and his age was determined by 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie can be obviously at least one and a half centuries .
it should be the world record for verteb@@ rates currently .
such as Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live in particular in e@@ isi@@ es , is not a coincidence .
also , the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Grön@@ land@@ wal , which was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska .
through the low temperatures , often the body of the animals live on the flame of flame .
so you pass later - and again slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals also become very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , through the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
so , &quot; a small animal lives in this and should concentrate to concentrate as many children as early as early as early as early as early as many children , says the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist .
a very large animal was to invest in a long life , rather than in a long life .

moreover , it could come to domin@@ ance , since the melting is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ co@@ a completed the Point Henry T@@ zer@@ ei , which led last year at a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melting of Al@@ co@@ a in Portland , lose money and ris@@ k@@ iss a cl@@ ung .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which drives the large aluminium mel@@ ted with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will be announced that three other owners will be announced .
the complex is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L goes out of that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L said that the treaties are so @-@ called &quot; backup shops , &quot; which will come into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termin@@ ation period , so they will be processed by 2017 .
therefore AG@@ L is of that the contracts will contribute to the income in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential effects on the revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for large @-@ commercial prices .
AG@@ L told that the contracts for the contracts were already written in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a termin@@ ation . &quot;
Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the agreements to ensure &quot; the ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to maintain the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting point . &quot;
the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it was with@@ drawn from the treaty .

more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of Sept@@ ember@@ issue of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of Man@@ ag@@ ist and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the coveted Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; in a room full of people who love I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers for wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the exception of problem @-@ most popular Show@@ bi@@ z files and producer from Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they ends the cover of her sister , and ends with a classic bet . they all have a surprises .
this represents the cl@@ esi@@ ed act of almost every birthday ( Se@@ ac@@ rest ) brought to the set , &quot; You had forgotten that we would have forgotten ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a flash point on an air@@ field around 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but moved to some other girls somehow to participate in this Pub@@ licity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began to begin with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ alls is big sister Kim mag , what the vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were on in April 2014 ) , but the Cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the Sept@@ ember@@ Edition is for Vo@@ gue , the most sold issue of the year .
with a scope of volume , rather than a fashion magazine is similar to a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of Wer@@ bed ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ oni@@ sta ) , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing system ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revel@@ ation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticip@@ ates that in the last two years the magazine still anticip@@ ating the official release of the official release .
women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ m@@ ages , the model@@ ed &quot; as &quot; Model@@ s , &quot; which are known as the &quot; Model@@ s . &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even when the low chance that his wife Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; flow model &quot; of its generation is described - under the former category , it is in good society .
these celeb@@ r@@ allies are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today that know how to know a good sn@@ ap@@ shots video ( even if it all goes on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who draw itself in the entertainment sector .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had published the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers should not be successful .
with its Reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always understood in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; Mi@@ st@@ ants of the ey@@ epi@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings boiled down very , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but at the abuse of over@@ rides it seems like the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertisements for your Grun@@ dig of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell your images from themselves on their respective pay@@ load apps .
you sells well @-@ done pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in her leisure time she can see them in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
church centres of 16@@ 0.000 people each year in 16@@ 0.000 people
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the aid of the country will be rejected by the public debt annually , while the sector looks at the effects of further medium @-@ short@@ ened transactions .
in Queensland , three of five individuals - mostly elderly people , immigrants , helpful workers , victims of violence and those who have no means to have an odd delay and similar legal services - if they are looking for free legal services and legal services .
legal services of the church , which are already above all over , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centers will lose some 30 percent of their federal government .
the director of the Bulgarian Socialist centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey was taken by the National Association of public centres , that thousands of people were rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without an increase in the position of the Federal Government would be worse than worse .
&quot; Queensland &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically subsidi@@ zed , which means thousands of people of important service you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who are forci@@ bly forced to leave people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families , which have been due to separ@@ ations , workers , the odd number of problems - all these people have problems right things , and that they can not receive the help you need them .
the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent by 2017 , which means thousands of hil@@ ly people from Queensland are forced to be forced to go with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Gener@@ ate General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to increase these mid@@ day immediately , so that the people need to help you need for legal issues .
last year , the state government fulfilled their support , funds for rect@@ angle to the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the church centres and its customer approach as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey conducted by countries : SPD and CD@@ U .
during the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute In@@ sa to the &quot; Picture &quot; -@@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could no longer be taken in the north , this is not possible according to the surveys in Berlin .
however , in both federal states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to pursue the government leaders .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD rose from 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent in five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the pol@@ l , the party could only be just below the CD@@ U , which could happen back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left collapsed on 19 percent ( prior to 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country day .
in spite of a slight losses of 6 percent ( prior to 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were once again one of the heavy country day .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first Smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator was on the market .
the successor domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kilogra@@ m and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5 .
it was di@@ cker and larger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite big .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , that would be enough for about two rarity .
an iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business , and it was the first Smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment even on the Internet , but they originate from a stone age of the online age .
however , 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile telephone manufacturer made a few months before@@ hand at the computer Fair C@@ ebit in Hannover as &quot; office in Western Australia . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot of : SMS and e @-@ mails to be sent and receive by fax it was possible by fax .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browser if also qu@@ ery .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be checked like a laptop .
a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ and @-@ white screen found .
quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of an smartphones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could say in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the start of the smartphone era at the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented model , was finally sold to Microsoft , and was involved in Microsoft .
today , the market today announced today that all of them arrived as Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for many people of everyday life .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung , and Apple market accounts for 5@@ 55 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this will come to the well @-@ running shops of the countless app provider and the telecommunications company .
around the smartphone developed an entire industry .
the decisive break to mass market was launched in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World implementation of i@@ Phones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a Internet communication , all to operate with touch screen .
the Vic@@ tory of Apple started , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the afternoon .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen is now available Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention .
on an average today , every German are now 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn all of the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , said in Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered flu@@ ch and bl@@ essings at the same time .
England must expand the Olympic Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row to the Olympics .
He@@ ath@@ row is not only accessible in our local community and throughout London , but throughout the country renovation and prosperity .
for me , this is the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as back in 2012 in London , when we paid a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions have benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought big benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and again , we reach a new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will create 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 40,000 new jobs , and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
such as they were in London in 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ row is great .
I was said that England never will be ready for the games and that we will be able to help us on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers had un@@ quite and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row in 2012 .
there are always obstacles to the survivors , but He@@ ath@@ row answered every question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
expansion is a possibility to create up to 18@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of capabilities and jobs to leave the airport as well as in all GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has a £ 11 billion of expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport in front , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies which was built in the world .
now they are ready to supply a third drive to supply , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we expand the Holy Spirit and He@@ ath@@ row to secure our future trade and have created a wealth of skills and employment , to which England is proud .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse play &quot; regarding ad block@@ ages
for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts , ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after the Facebook ad@@ mitt@@ edly , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users can update its filter in the program to block again advertisements in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ ard would change the coding regarding its advertising page , to display re@@ alizing the detection , which is part of the page advertising is , too .
but ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ to @-@ war battle has already been in progress since the invention of display changes in the way , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is soon coming with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s biggest company for social media has left in the fight , is a strong indi@@ z , like a wor@@ rying display of the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ in@@ air and Adobe approximately 200 million people re@@ cur@@ ly in line ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook about their mobile terminal devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ able 84 percent of the ad measures are related to Facebook .
the company has a ad block on desktop PCs apart from the mobile display block no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertisements on desktop PCs make a sufficiently large share of revenue , allowing Facebook to be worth a worth@@ while as a worth@@ while .
on Tuesday Facebook with that it would update its &quot; ad @-@ fer@@ encing pool &quot; to have the people to have more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook explains that the new filter will be wor@@ rying , because they would be able to block the content on the side , no advertising are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for users , that &apos;s no positive experience , we plan to talk to discuss the problem , &quot; divided a speech by Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent , which is why we have focused on the developer tools such as Ad Works , to put out more control into the hands of the people .
a self committed suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
police attacked witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
a woman put in the Dun@@ es &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were taken from several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d .

it remains , however , if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a mer@@ ging of avoid@@ able ?
this is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver could not be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where one person in Dun@@ es were running on the highway - it was decided that the car driver has to go out that a pedestri@@ ans in the middle of the night is running on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the conduc@@ tivities were acqu@@ itted , after they had passed a man and killed in August 2014 a night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had de@@ dr@@ unk and has become a court in the street .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman -- who had been in charge of an emergency call -- in a righteous way that the presence of a man on the road had a &quot; totally unusual and un@@ fore@@ seen situation , &quot; said the judges said .
everyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should be with the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was according to the projections of a new NASA climate models probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms , which are similar to those of clim@@ af@@ ers .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus can be used with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once have been proved to be similar conditions .
scientists have previously shown that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have a thin , low @-@ like atmosphere , nevertheless could be slow to further .
the model lighted also the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet showed that more dry areas as de Earth , but had once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life to accommodate life and more intense .
the early Venus were also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ ated the slow revolution of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io , in an press release .
this heated the surface and produces rain , which makes a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella due to the surface of a bulk of the sun heat .
the result is average @-@ temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than the earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that resembles that of evolution resembles the evolution of plann@@ er research .
although they were once more inhab@@ itable , Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra @-@ violet light in the course of several years .
their oceans , ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned down by the ultra @-@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know today .
the researchers conducted the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ ding teles@@ cope has helped astron@@ om@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of the rotor rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data is helping to understand the astron@@ om@@ ers , why is stars in the star amount to different rates , as well as in which the Rot@@ ation period covered with the creation @-@ up creation .
we hope that we find out more about the relationship between the mass of a Star , his age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s inf@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years from Earth .
many stars in this constellation make up about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now turn on the fastest .
at top @-@ end rates , this strip @-@ star large amounts of con@@ vey@@ ors are from the win@@ ches .
as this winds have travel through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star @-@ age begins , his rotary rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotary rate of any Star by putting the time between the release of a noticeable constellation - like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that a massive @-@ star slower than less solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars of dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ ghts as smaller .
&quot; the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to be able to be massive , while faster rot@@ ors to be moving , very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the constellation can be so close to the Ple@@ j@@ ades so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mic laboratory to compare creating qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar web press in both directions , younger , and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still a lot of us how we want to learn more about how the How , W@@ ann and War@@ um stars are slow down to the rot@@ ational rates , and so to imp@@ ose their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues received in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the astron@@ aut Journal .
a controversial of Bas@@ eball @-@ star will be available from
the Tränen ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US @-@ Bas@@ eball Star in the best days of base .
after his emotional return , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional race will take place on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the tri@@ cky of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; good@@ db@@ ye &apos; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star representatives of major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared .
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract signed him for 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 he is an advisor to consultants and youth coach in the future .
as players paid it Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas leader@@ board ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 , he managed some mile@@ stones .
together with the Hall of F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays have only two additional bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
however , in the rest of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is nevertheless not included .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field , it is controversial , his appearance is outside of the square .
the super@@ star was launched at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; in 2009 between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a training in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect , for years , have been promoting an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute it was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the league could even have been done for the year 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez said back to South .
his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not running silent .
while many Bas@@ eball legends will receive the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job includes no f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
at least Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and the actress and the actress and the actress and the actress and the actress and the actress , sympath@@ y with the fans of Yan@@ kee @-@ Erz@@ gebirge , Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; We want A @-@ Rod , &quot; s@@ angen at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski .
s@@ wis@@ s : because of a positive result , Ge@@ zer the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be exceeded by the first official attack in 2016 .
a stir@@ red athlete had been won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing have become the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ ist Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres from Bulgaria and Polish Ge@@ zer the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already cra@@ w@@ ning athle@@ tics track , this messages will come to Un@@ time .
in Chen the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d was detected by the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d , which is used as m@@ asked means for dop@@ ing sub@@ inst@@ ances .
the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time in the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 year old passed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ flies , only 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have to participate in the operations of over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing requested .
the National Association turn the affair &quot; very seriously and demands Chen full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua , from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot;
for the first time in history is not more the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio sick@@ ly the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not guilty , &quot; the only explanation could become a dietary supplement , &quot; explained the female athlete .
according to the report , it is supposed to be the banned substance to negotiate the blood cells of the EP@@ O .
dan@@ ek@@ ova was confirmed as preliminary , according to B@@ NT , the B sample was already positive .
Bulgaria Prime Minister Boj@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow filed an interview with criticism of the athlete &apos;s athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not withdraw the right battles , &quot; said : &quot; we have Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are excluded . &quot;
about all the li@@ fter gloves are not allowed to participate in the city of the chron@@ ically .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic Games in the class up to 85 kg , such as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z has been tested positively on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both meet the intake , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is one of another severe impact on the reputation of the whole sport .
the global association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian crew up to an exception because of systematic reviews in the world , also called L@@ äu@@ fern@@ ation Kenya in Rio numerous bad news .
also in the swimming sport , the previous year in China also had the previous persecution in China for violent conflicts between the athlete .
so the Fren@@ chman Camille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l I will see myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sun stood in the center of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I did not have time and no respect for Dop@@ ing @-@ Bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this .
Sun was tested in 2014 with the Chinese Championships positive for the stimul@@ ans Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month Sper@@ re .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses H@@ acker her sol@@ dering
programming of Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ Malware are currently targeted companies - and are also successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the Malware in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of the surve@@ yed companies have been at least once , in the last twelve months of at least once , several times victims of an attack with Er@@ press@@ er software .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies had already been a goal of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware explanation .
40 per cent of the victims of the victims were issued by the required dis@@ covers in order to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators &quot; software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , according to the observations in company networks .
they are successful there , if potential dis@@ sol@@ ation is much higher than in private users , it is much higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently using a fri@@ gh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most painter programs are still designed to send advertisements .
then the perpet@@ rators are the perpet@@ rators software for themselves .
only private users left the goal , but the change went to company attack was done quickly in the last few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a O@@ pf@@ ator , it is searching for un@@ long modified files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos .
this files encrypted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and sol@@ ves the origin@@ als .
subsequently , the software will be presenting the requirements of the compress@@ ors .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims of money , mostly in the form of crash .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , it &apos;s for companies to provide sensitive data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage increases , if there is a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to break the business activities , in case of a case of people in life .
in Germany , several times were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of health acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this promotes the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that have to pay their data .
for managers , it is difficult to reject in view of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of the perpet@@ rators .
the chi@@ pper turn again and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the F @-@ Secure security researchers have investigated and contact with the compress@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to build more money .
do you explain their victims of the chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , free online websites or de@@ cryp@@ n for example files .
and they will be able to pay attention to payments by a few hundred euros , companies have to pay partially hard @-@ beat and five digit sums , to obtain their data .
in view of potentially high and relatively high risk of profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware compress@@ ors , the H@@ acker will always be professional and share , explains security experts from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person may write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programmer sell their damage , then in the form of a software construction to the actual compress@@ ors .
the pre @-@ Malware kits created by the malware self , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery is a adap@@ ting tool to be changed , so smaller configurations , appearance , and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the compress@@ ors are looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
if you log@@ ged in one of the forums on the ground , it buys the set of a crimin@@ als and to install one another , to install the software to as many PCs .
the payment is made per domestic computers .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the dissem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ewski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known for many companies that get their data better .
via 50 percent of the companies IT developers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ survey , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware can rely on with file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already revised new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful business , the perpet@@ rators &quot; instead with the publication of sensitive data like approximately customer lists or price loss , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin Kle@@ cz@@ yn@@ ski .
this is the potential of damage to type of data according to type of data is much higher than earlier .
even , the perpet@@ rators could also be completely new goals on the Internet of things .
at the Hack@@ l Conference , Def@@ con had demonstrated security researchers , as they were able to play with the Internet of thermo@@ static under its control .
in the middle of winter , the activation in a so @-@ called heating so many victims could be worth a sol@@ ver value .
if the perpet@@ rators are then able to block a whole manufacturing road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday dust .
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack it : a little SUV , a little Coupé , and even the versatility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds pretty much , but the HR @-@ V created on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V are rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the F@@ ond much space , it acts close to no place .
the materials of the inside are well finished and are pleas@@ antly , only the cockpit is falls .
versatile vehicles is the HR @-@ V when using the storage room .
there is not only a car boot from 453 l on high and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less mag@@ ically , than it sounds : the seat of the back@@ bench is highly efficient and provide the storage space that is high on the bottom up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high .
the car boot is good , however , the loading height is 650 mm higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel version with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of torque .
however , his work is likely to make his work .
the all @-@ day consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is still another motor : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the transfer is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be somewhat direct .
the equipment can be desired in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; with no requests .
the City emergency relief assistant ( operates up to Tempo 32 ) , a coll@@ isions system and the track assistant lecturer .
the coll@@ ision , sometimes , because he rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ eled objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the correspondence assistant .
and the intelligent Tem@@ po@@ controller respond to the traffic detection detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t at required speed .
the full connectivity are only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch tou@@ ch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two USB@@ - and a HDMI jack are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
the approx . 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top diesel is in order .
who wants to invest so much , will receive the gasoline version of 20,000 Euros , the diesel of 23@@ ,000 euros .
engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a comprehensive and versatile car .

a Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger bridge .
for a liability be found only in danger that are typical of the air traffic , the Upper Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .

case of illness : when paid the promot@@ ers
female vac@@ ation@@ ers get only money back after their journey , if the cause of the disease is free in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the ver@@ ty case a family was difficult to diarrhea and vomiting in the second day of their Turkish descent .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective gl@@ ass@@ ment , which had been suspected of sea@@ water .
the family was the view , the journey was a lack - and accused of the promot@@ er .
before court had no success .
although the applicant in fact was def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er heard only briefly before the departure of the K@@ lä@@ ger .
he had to assume , until then , that the sea@@ water was in order .
he did not hurt his information , so the judgement .
especially in the samples of water no changes were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - if possible , some of them are going to have a general life risk .
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach , in July , many people were afraid of concern .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time on terrorist .
safe is : our country is not allowed to answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
this triumph we will not use the terrorists .
if stri@@ pped faster the country would have to leave the country , but the security , and strength of the population of the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to meet the implementation of proposals for the general election by 2017 .
he also announced another person@@ alization of security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit size arrangement over several years . &quot;

for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère plans the use of the investig@@ ators .
the SPD Vice President Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helped security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior made clear against action of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was a slope for hin@@ ge in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) .

better traffic flow on the highway exit Li@@ br@@ inger
there are regularly on the revers@@ al street - here &apos;s a picture from November .
however , this shall change : the legal gu@@ en@@ ant should be extended .
this is a good news for all Auto @-@ driver , driving on the environment on the environment road every evening in the St@@ au , when they drive on the motorway , Zub@@ r@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state road works will be extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
driving er can be directly off right by the Hammer street .
the great advantage : the traffic shares earliest at the earliest , thereby reducing the overall assessment of the federal road 51 , which will be improved on the varied section of the Federal straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Repres@@ entation , Münster @-@ West .
the driving driving on the Zub@@ r@@ inger , the mot@@ er , above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days goes from the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
reason the con@@ i@@ ons on the B 51 is just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic will only be reached by car on the highway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations show that the bridge has no longer necessary to load the required load capacity , notably in particular the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the carrying out daily power , the state company can not say it .
however , with years expect : for the bridge has an official service life until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the law @-@ sponsored law , the state company has sought the transport of a we@@ aker time in school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be on Tuesday and Wednesday , next to the construction site .

rain instead of constellation : hopes for weather forecast
the weather has made the star@@ ving Gu@@ ck@@ les in southwest Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to a stand by the bill - but there are still hope .
the night was suitable for clouds and rain , for making the kingdom of heaven , said the President of the Ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll definitely see a lot of shooting in the sky .
in the constellation , there are Per@@ sil@@ den , which belong to the fastest Star car@@ bs with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they were apparently out of the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which dates back to the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , you &apos;ll be able to move around at night , and in the morning we are not far away to think of the wake @-@ up of the wake @-@ up .
this is all other than relaxing .
anyway , one should be found with such problems in good society : according to Robert Koch @-@ Institut , approximately one quarter of the adult sleep disorders , and more than ten percent will find their sleep frequently or permanently .
how vo@@ irs or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there may be diverse causes of view , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ich and sleep Medicine .
what you want to walk among them , but the In@@ som@@ ing is never a I , and a sleep@@ er disorder .
just the over@@ clock can find many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , board member of the German Hou@@ sehold association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces are complex .
in beyond , organic , psychological or delayed @-@ related factors , but also drugs .
not rare , the sleep@@ er expression of an other disease .
&quot; very early wake up , especially at depression is often called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors in each other .
who , for example , if a her@@ ni@@ ated disc has been bad , you can see every two to three hours and begins if you want to use all the problems of problems , and guarantee up to gre@@ et , We@@ ap@@ an example is an example .
this leads to lead , and sleep is not possible anymore .
from when it should be with sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
those who are over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , should be inf@@ ring@@ ed on the day , should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look very different : you are beaten , tired , in@@ mates , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easy to provo@@ ke and has a mood sw@@ ings , or physical complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to lin@@ ders , it is important to figure out their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral behavi@@ oral therapy , or medicines - classic dormit@@ ories only in exceptional cases and for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ery .
born in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze ; head of the interdisciplinary research centre at the Charité University Medical Center Berlin .
for this reason , one should apply for sleeping problems at the house doctor .
the problems can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should be to sleep in the sleep , and what happened ?
for an investigation in the sleep laboratory of medicine , for example , in case of sn@@ ail with respiratory difficulties , if you do not find the cause of a sleep@@ er case , Fi@@ etze &apos;s cause .
we don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just don &apos;t make a lunch sleep &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ ber .
after loading , one gets to his normal time in bed .
in addition to electro@@ des the body carries a nose glasses , a chest strap , and a anten@@ n@@ ae .
additionally , a camera is on the speaker to the sleep .
how can the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of screws where you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ eks counts on : regular sleep @-@ hours , not to sleep in bed , not to sleep too long , not to sleep to sleep , alcohol , and at night , not to watch the clock - then you will see immediately , and that is not able to keep it .

the conve@@ ying system in the swimming sport was bad , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we can compete with countries that have much support and even in the theme of Dop@@ ing doesn &apos;t see it or even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t tell that controls should be set out here , &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , the D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .

the Tat@@ ars had been committed as a ban@@ ana and bag @-@ ste@@ els as a ban@@ ana and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants from the airport in Düsseldorf a ban@@ de once again that the polic@@ emen from last theft is known .
two women and two men had been committed during the mid @-@ July of this year , and were engaged in the Colle@@ ctive , worker , and especially professionally .
the specialists at the Krimin@@ al@@ miss@@ ariat 34 may have travelled to Germany , which had traveled to Germany for the holding of stra@@ ps to Germany , four actions .
they had a total of more than 15,000 euros .
old built , a few aven@@ ue of lime trees , in which the Rig@@ o@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain acts as far as the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
it is going to the west from the east to the west , comes along with games , a visitor &apos;s kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
at the facade of a gray house , someone has been spra@@ yed ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl that is supposed to be dem@@ ol@@ ished , it will be built here : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
article about this &quot; trendy Born district , &quot; as the well @-@ owned real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are preferred by burning cars with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have disabled people , but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events .
since the beginning of this year , H@@ enkel also has been a hard approach in the police since the beginning of this year , which was a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having been cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , were appointed official statements for three weeks , with 30 to 40 officials and three team@@ cars on site , locked parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
during its newly renovated construction workers in the order of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , an Berlin administrative court decided that the do@@ zer had been illegal , and one day later , police and workers went under the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ isers and inhabitants .
at this summer afternoon , the road takes peaceful : parents are sitting with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement ends before the houses in the sun , others .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main point of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who is here three children , mainly from the police presence of Gener@@ v@@ t .
with the inhabitants of the front projects , they divide the concern in front of Mi@@ eten and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it sounds not only after a pine that leads the majority of police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ped left .
the gra@@ bs , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ zer and the police have taken up their neighbours , it is obviously not clear .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers district which , today , in comparison to the rest of the city is a lower average income , and high poverty risk .
the house and the new@@ born residential projects belong to Kie@@ z : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied by the former East Germany , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer road all near the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer came under large police commanded by a real road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ aer , and partly still inhabited by people who were inhabited by 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in the past years is increasingly becoming the magn@@ ets for tourists and Ele@@ mentary liner of all over the world : with them a population of GDR @-@ times and former house @-@ house had their pine .
this makes it also in the Mi@@ eten noticeable , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ ol@@ ympi@@ c shall be attacked as symbols for this development : they can be subjected to cur@@ ated slices or freshly t@@ ted façade , which were disc@@ arded by color .
no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; centre autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reason for that , that not all neighbors the problem , might be the problem that it is not affected by crime as bodi@@ ly viol@@ ating such as body injury , according to statistics , it is exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal investig@@ ates , the ten@@ ds and newly built new buildings and newly renovated houses meet .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial of 94 , cannot be heard by un@@ certainty .
whatever the violence is concerned , it is obvious : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which were definitely not been determined .
even the famous burning cars give it right in the Rig@@ ol@@ ites already longer .
for the studied architect , their road is not a criminal fuel point , on the contrary , &quot; here it helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other than any other . &quot;
new geb@@ auer is aware of the Rig@@ ol@@ ite road - and remained in the Rig@@ o@@ ga Street .
therefore , it was so important that the natives were with@@ drawn up their road , by the police , the politics and the media , who all over all over the city in July .
but in the eyes of berries such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by the disp@@ utes of newly built new buildings in former Bau@@ l@@ g@@ aps , who burned the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are all con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can &apos;t use any gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what should you ask for if a never ?
here , on all sides fru@@ stration is a , also at the police and the inhabitants .
for the drawn , that was about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has a little understanding : the great projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
whoever draws up , should be aware that - exactly how somebody , who moves into a pub in a pub that can compl@@ ain very hard about noise .
all persons were asked for people with their right name , don &apos;t have to name it with their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organi@@ zer .
she is also social worker on site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le contracted the refugee camps for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agogue supports the team of administration at Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as contact person for all actors : refugees , working refugee , administration , authorities and who are otherwise still included .
shelf customer from the Arbeitsk@@ reis Konjunktur : indicate that the honorary report has now been grat@@ eful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is , the ei@@ gh of Woll@@ mil@@ de@@ au that is especially a problem .
so , some - less sp@@ elling than rather on the multitude of wish @-@ to @-@ do @-@ wish , meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
we are looking for an administrative force in a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ tic of mil@@ de@@ au .
yet administration work was not a central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , there is an organization that work with people in place and also behind the scenes as well as network of network .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ors and principal official actors supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems .
soon , new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem is that for some time , ap@@ partments are approved for connecting forces which have been recognized .
for connecting rooms , the municipal utilities are in charge .
you have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations , have to carry the local themselves .
the responsibility is moving from the landing office of the Commune , and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
today , the administration doesn &apos;t find any private apartments .
it has so far not so far , we are able to instru@@ cted about private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the apartments must be venti@@ l@@ ated , as it is so nice .
so we will soon be installed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße into the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , training places , training places , training places , training sessions , A @-@ Euro jobs and emi@@ rate for refugees and migrants have to be found .
&quot; more places are good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many works in the building yard or help house champions , do not do not for non @-@ profit work - and motiv@@ ates , and very ti@@ dy , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
they hopes that the job for the church is a positive impact in a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only work , but not only work .
the day would have a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a confidence @-@ feeling .
so there &apos;s offers as sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
so , you can jump here in management and honorary membership .
it is centrally , that the refugees get the feeling they were in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to declare the refugees that it takes place and can be meaning@@ ful . for example , with language courses .
whoever looks like sometime the feeling of development , he could not work in Ur@@ bach anyone did not work and be un@@ profitable , who will never be able to integrate it .
the significant majority was motiv@@ ated .
this problem is also , &quot; people say hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; people who doesn &apos;t know anything else . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer may still be motivated to motiv@@ ate others .
this was already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two according to recent events are afraid of radi@@ c@@ alization , even in a small village such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ ned n@@ ai@@ v I &apos;ll call it . &quot; a residual risk could not close it .
sensi@@ ti@@ zed to the hel@@ per .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to the refugees .
the fear of fear that the attacks they have complete completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; you want to show that they have nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you need to keep main and honorary volunteer on site and in the region , according to activities .
they always have always in the background , that soon , a new Sto@@ cks could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
needs Germany a upper limit ?
this question is clear to answer the policy .
actually , it is too cruel and to set hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we want , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , which would relax the location .
Reg@@ ine client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher can also be more reasonable to integrate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 persons , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , one may need to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is complicated , as there is no simple answers .
