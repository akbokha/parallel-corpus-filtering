<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and trade agreement TTP, this would like Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, one of the two US presidential elections were at the tax and energy policy as well as in one of the basic demand.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policies between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump is rather small to keep in doubt about it, as the state of economy could harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton said to death the economy to death and death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he himself would be quite differently, claims.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return to regulatory measures, and he makes for a far-reaching control group with lower tax rates strongly - for private professionals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton also says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the tax would be increased to the ranks, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the fact, trump and Clinton is nearly worried about.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate, announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state investment programme in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy, and are rejected by the nationalist teapy wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, without any internal discussions, we could get a party with internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policy.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump is planning to build coal-fired power plants and the carbon development in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion is also possible to be protected in the protected areas as possible, the Paris climate agreement wants to boost its climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton also wants to strengthen renewable energy with their investment program, and calls for: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and will create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazide trade agreement, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the same time, both the US would not want to isolate international trade isolating - but just American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">That should also be paid to be paid by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">They will increase them to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is a thing in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says, he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one side is Trump, who wants to boost the economy and citizens, to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">Its critics keep him before, so that the household deficit would only be larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who require at least of the ranks, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "any frozen woman has gained experience with sexual violence."</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who have to escape alone, almost already in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">If they are arriving in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen sitting four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby which is most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="11">They chased shortly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">It speaks to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a leader of the Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralized accommodations for women, women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made the facility along with Pro family and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">She was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Males there is no other - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is one quman before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say," every woman who made it here, has made her back on her flight with sexual violence, "says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"men escape because of wars because they are politically pursued because of torture or death, or because their families she told them as a hopes for Europe," she tells them.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women there are other reasons for the flight: "many steal out of it, because they don't see any other places."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home they have made experience with sexual violence, Zwangan, Honorary, slavery, or practiced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them fort.</seg>
<seg id="27">The flight goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the tugs for instance for a bottle of water an sexual act, is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that the end, as soon as they are in Germany, irre, tells evil.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, women would often be viewed as mindermatized and worse than lower in the refugee.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women who live in the north north, are traumatized, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so happy to say anything else.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or she was not enough to speak openly about the living space because the sham is too large."</seg>
<seg id="36">As they often does not help to help, there are more accommodations for them, requires bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district registrations are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">At the question if they are using a similar project as in Munich in their incomprehension zone, reply to a number of No.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there are so something in accommodations of governments do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Schwaben, women are not separated from the government, Karl-Heinz Meyer, press precher of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Unter- and Mittelfranken, there are some shared storeys, or their houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two main accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the EP committee on the rights of women and gender equality in the European Parliament calls that women have to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study that was published for the committee, it means: "it is very important that men and women are separated from men."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a strie that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leader of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to proclaim the hands and an official mandate for the unofficial war of the words and economic sanctions during the end of the eight months.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayer in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I cannot fail to say that Ankara is to reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But putins also worked out for his smile, and he was barely heat from himself, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">And in contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke repeated his "love" Putin - according to a report full of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also said that relationships with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further ahead of the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the next day, a paper described that Erdogan had so far as if it would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">For me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable Kühle showed that the Russian State of Russia had not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter lugale at the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Moscow in response to the time was wutory.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin ted out and accused Ankara to be fallen in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The verses was even greater than it was committed by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetegrere is difficult to rebuild it if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media has a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed as the Turks would carry all the guilt.</seg>
<seg id="21">In contrast, the accusations of executive officials that Erdoğan's own family had been benefited from illegal oil trading in the country of Syria, which will be controlled from the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He contested this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message, that it was time to look back in front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin of the presidents received the excuse of the President Erdoğan, he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a truce is clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires all friends which he can get started, after having won the last month a coup d'etat almost his Amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">There are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have met Turkey hard - in particular the ban of charter flights, which every year usually takes several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel age and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be resumed again.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late Dalmatian area of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state-TV cheap fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti in the following manner: "tourists there long, tomatoes here for long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is based on the west, as it was a response to the attempted hierarchical movement as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the EU-accession negotiations for accession to the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - the pists to draw up the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian State leader won in Ankara with safety for a bonus that he called for the attempted coup d "état for the elected state of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-evident for Moscow, that has a self-evident, self-sitting fear of opponents.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace, made by Russia and Turkey, one of how it was once described an analyst in an analyst: two countries that took away from the west, and poorly treated away from the west.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow gave the role of a peace treaty in Moscow, but to Russia, Turkey and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after nearly three hours on the press conference, both President at the press conference said that they were not the topic of the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey prevented it to answer a question about their differences on answers, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">It is no significant consensus above, where a common Nenner can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostility, and in view of the potential of a perfect Disaster, NATO member and Turkey a Russian fight jet, it's certainly better to talk about two leaders of state at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="16">I say now, that we are no global targets, but local objectives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will work in its own congregations for something different, and our staff will work under these brands with customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that there will no longer lead the Six Nations Sponsoring no longer lead, and that it will increase the different brands in its Sport-Sponsoring region.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop the brands of the brands, as we focus on our inside (we asked) to make this to a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman of the Executive Board.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very zynisch about three years ago, when we said that we would have to be a great bank for our customers.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, the Putin is that Putin will be ordered as chairman of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been the representative of Ivanovs since 2012, was named after his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>

<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin (in Russian) that he was followed by the Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Regions.</seg>
<seg id="10">About his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of statute and checks for the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov are asked to leave his post and to Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been made to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergej Ivanov worked for a long time in the narrowest confidentiality of Vladimir Putins, as he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, which was broadcast in television, both men that the Chief of Staff was placed on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the income of the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of hierarchies?</seg>
<seg id="20">There is no one no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who had once managed to lead the Russian environmental policy, only once the Russian environmental policy would like to lead a large scepsis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said "It is true that I was asked to join me in a conversation with me this very complicated post - it might be almost say - invading the post four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I have been the president of the Russian Presidential Administration since four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin's former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the KGB was appointed Ivanov in his deputy representative.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov had been assumed that Ivanov could go to the second term of President of Russia, because there would have been a third term coup against the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this item was taken by another, near allies of the allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>

<seg id="7">So far, it is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD leader Christoph Bratmann said: "we want to build us with the Green Party, who wants to build 20 percent of all apartments as a socializing."</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the affordable apartments can also be found in the stock.</seg>

<seg id="21">How to get the loss of other around 1300 affordable apartments that will run out in the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, who are worth buying</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a fascinating one, how the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child does not want to move away from outside, but rather would prefer to spend their free time to work on screens, was killed in the final decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and to be active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At first, the time on the screen was initially limited on the television, then on video card and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities are not open to each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn that is based on the characters which initially developed to the characters in the 1990s (later created a flash series, playing cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of Popculture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">In less days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it works?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the player can follow with their smart phones, and are searching for Pokémons, who are traced with a GPS if once found once, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or. "</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Carogram, an app for Apple Watch, who was recently followed by Washington Post recently, that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of women followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes, by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company knows what Pokémon Go - it looks only the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring "up to 30 minutes," from the sofa, "and" every day are active to see ears because many public embassies are getting boring, and many people come to come from people who look back.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the meaning of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly make sports drives, reduces his chances to develop cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to start it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that the people brings to do something to do something, making them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mapped game, which must always be complain about anything else.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit already could follow our activity, they gave us any reason to push the sport, as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The New will lose its maturity and the use will be retraced with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons, however, there will be more games to be able to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world, and many people are helping to help hunting, splitter, and locked up.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals got nothing from the summer elections with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they were understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For little more than so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and landing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, which are convinced by the electoral struggle, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a locals, not for the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems: in the holidays are helper, depend for posters, air balloons, and at the end of the vote, only arevoked.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and final day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had to pass over again on the people over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can't say that at all, it has just started.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of the SPD / CDU coalition, must be fear for office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is clear clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">The excitement is exciting, such as strongly Neuling AfD, and what remains at the end of coalition dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008, leader, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees his grandbadge.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributed by Roses and chateau a little with the people, as it was also his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors and cold feet get cold feet and gives his guilt at the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, her "We create" the ascent of the right-round lists, which will probably now cost the beautiful post office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced, as it is, if you get to the wrong time at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited two Chancellor Angela Merkel to grandfather, Angela Merkel in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group voted not, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as the Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">There was probably the majority of other federal states, "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But there was a pity anyone who had to hear from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northern Irish CDU is mostly largely to the usual elections on market places and shopping centers with deckchairs and air balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, in addition, Kokert is only one "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also reported that their land is based on the basis of the basis, that it has to be very strict rigorously to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the Lefts, the SPD, the Greens: in the country of the country hardly exist.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU's electoral defaults to its competitors, but you will need to do, where people are hunters, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden marriages, each birthday party must be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called Sellering up to a particularly aggressive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Euro MPs most recently with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election the SPD gained clear with 35,6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Small Party, with seven percent in the surveys, will create the jump to the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern Tuesome, and lay out their electoral campaign of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," calls the state director Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electoral battling out on track cater to local voices under the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt straight with a house boat by the mecklenic lakes and is still nice.</seg>

<seg id="14">Also, not the fact that Germany must implement several EU guidelines on flight data and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video monitoring and staff for security authorities are also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals to do so with the SPD: he wants to make sympathisers for terrorist groups under penalty and jihadists with double-citizenship in the German Pass.</seg>

<seg id="19">A few new ideas will be presented by Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are some partly in itself: he plans to process quick procedures for sleeves and more possibilities for contingent of people in front of deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are to be picked up in the country, are supposed to leave their smart phones and social media Accounts for security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">For more than ever, asylum seekers, he wants to do some worse than so far - such that Straftates or their papers are going to be aware, to wear their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legally heir.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works even unlocked and can be open to any questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - in the imineating treatment of patient, the question: what does not do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to enter the issues between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it's not possible to speak in speech that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg refugees were.</seg>
<seg id="28">There were also many people in view of the high refugee camps around the security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that were able to deepened the people, even in competition times are not clamps.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormously high in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">Great safeguarding is big.</seg>
<seg id="34">Yes, it can be finalised.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and the SPD are thus increasing the inner security and increasingly in position.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the last days there went between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garment dispute over the equipment of the police, then over a security policy of some unions of the Interior, in which the Ressortex is also a Burka prohibition and a return from double nationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who purchased sound boards?</seg>
<seg id="2">All men and medium-sized men.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you have a commentary for him under the pseudonym, non-avenues at the pseudonym Non Alleschema's age, this testimony leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov the multiple emergence of sound boards did not rely on a boom in Millennium Target, which would like to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to the Midlife Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a plate, are all travel according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hormones by Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older squabs leave their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would follow a news report on TV set, I would follow me, while I was in the middle of a bustling street in Soho, a modest purse, my hands and a little part of what I say, "so let you let us see an immediate view."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's look forward to us.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the building where independent vendors have been located - there is a handful of fantastic turntables.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the camera to turn the camera to turn off for the next part, in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate her age and vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am with Sister Ray (data number: eight men mean age, one woman, probably around the 20) follow, is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I do?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 panels.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record plates, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by his house), where the walls of its housing is furnished.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has a great number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy boards, which he was not able to buy, when he was selling young and pleite again, which he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy the late 60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I thought to buy a little bit too young to buy it." he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who sell plates, rather an extremely introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't eat and drink not much too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback in comeback, and to buy the comeback in order to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions, I have led, people in rule so by 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy your CDs again, "says he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to the record of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what is that of the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to recognize that record shops has a calm community of equals.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers who took contact with the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to return to stability of trusted Schallplatten, by counterparts, the happy Jugenderhood memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think it can sometimes be the filling of a Leere or ownership of material, as a kind of Trost," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors so and I think it is in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to employ a spiritual way.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" fles a staff of one record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of the people who bought a plate a record, they haven't heard it yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey found that 41% have a record players who never use it, while 7% of those that have a plate, no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I went through a stack of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men mean age), has noticed a "trophy-aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone arrived recently here and said," I do not have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radical Schallplatte, that I can do it into the shelf. "</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it's definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive-consuming, less musiklastig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older that come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has dedicated to the sound board almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, as I used to go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists, the photos make, teenagers and women's medium ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is something less relaxed than in the pre-standing shops - Wild's latest synthesized pop. instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such diversity of diversity.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very sunny, but brand-psychic traumata are badly damaged, if you want to meet someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs since a few minutes in business and considered the variation on for sale plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">You rather get an Display bummel than a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserves much, therefore, the collecting is not real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs plenty of.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy music from a computer or to listen to other kind, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a lovely seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record-owners have to have inspired: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the call the jeans Hotpants to Mustern, which I was a group of young teenagers who prefer to buy Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the left, a Trepphouse, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to set them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But in view of its attraction, any attraction for these items are going to be more money for the industry and to send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money as others, it is the one that is most important for luxury items such as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of women artists and record players that exist in reality, record shops and online shop.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are presumably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety, not with the balls from the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while keeping the starrender view of an unsecret, 30-year-old anchorator, that has nothing out of all men's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="7">Behind each Gold, a battalion of wilting helpers who make up the difference and there was no one of the coach that would not know about 30 months ago, whether he was diagnosed this day at all, when he was diagnosed with him.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said, He said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operated, and the did she did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, spread all over.</seg>

<seg id="14">The trio had lucky enough to begin with the beginning of 2014, outside the season, the interruptions came to a minimum, if that's under such circumstances has been at all the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go again better.</seg>

<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen cried alb in the process, lead in the process. "</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get you with it.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not to make it a bit tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to get no fireworks today, we wanted to get a good result, and we wanted to win the race, which we did too.</seg>

<seg id="9">For those often solve social and family structures in the age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel kipp in her choir: "to talk and perfectly organize, can rely on the other and another - a choir is a very special form of awareness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Can sing in the positive sense, Hackler writes, writes Hackler.</seg>

<seg id="20">At the same time, simultaneously, on the own voice, and to focus on a given rhythm, and to keep the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one sees by the Singen in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>

<seg id="28">Man does not hesitate to go alone - with 50 sinless people who hears only if you go a tone beside him?</seg>
<seg id="29">On the search for the suitable offer, various ways, says Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings someone of the most famous circle in a senior enchyor, you can easily connect to your name.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who like to sing in a church choir, can directly contact the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can be found beyond the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors have to ask help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should be able to use a choir, like hackler.</seg>

<seg id="5">That is why we are the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identity Movement" is a grouping with French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It applies to "Multivulti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of own identity through a foreign identity."</seg>

<seg id="19">For the constitutional guard the possible contacts of this kind will be relevant from a certain point.</seg>

<seg id="22">This is no longer recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a look at the significant increase of voting rights and attacks on asylum seekers, he said Maate, he would not speak of a new right terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we've found in the past years that it can be the right-finding structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>

<seg id="28">The previous groups are in the regional level or in social network.</seg>
<seg id="29">He worried about this, Maate said that many of them went to the account of people who had not entered into the right wing in the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the Tatras at attacks on asylum accommodation in attacks are not known as criminals, politically active Straftly or Trader on the right scene.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel more resistant and softening, a Rasender Staffellan between Competition and Streets.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, when the Olympic fennel itself a burning of burning, that is protect from the bracelets to Turner's Turner's Turner's Turner.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't read the TV set, sending a newspaper or talking to your neighbours in the Warteshop in Coffeshop without talk about Simone Biles, Katie Leadery or the fight between Michael Pere and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women with dimples, would have already be sent under these known names that are sent to Prime Time, set up by sponsorers and chariots, and it would be a floats, Turner or even fechter.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights against gold in the Olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame lit not every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not widely recognised: air pistes, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always be able to swim and let it be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I had a modest arguments for my certain favorite inmate, then let me take the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping already in 2000 has been a Olympic event, the last 16 years ago, it was perceived that many of whom I had asked, I did not know that it is at all at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional Ignoranz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA athletes was sent to competition, it has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping competition and had had a athlete until 2012, who had managed to win up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians is to divide the prizes for men and the Chinese, and the Canadians die for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong, China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping in the trampoline jumping is a certain outside environment, some because it's suitable for the unreconnaissance flight for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a geothermal enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is humorous potential - the cartoonous quotations of his never to be swollen - but also the Grazie of the Turnens and diving, which combines two sports that are essentially included.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, as much as "sprints."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner jump on a huge range trampoline, shooting almost to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of failing movements (rotation, hares and saltos) before they are on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to the official Olympic Games, following execution, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes born from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medaillennia must continue to gold, faster, upwards, and go over, sometimes up to the end, sometimes down to the goal, sometimes down and back, down at the top and down the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not only mark the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV transmission also a further polarity: the world or the Olympic arekord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted Streets is nobel, beeksworth, even fanatic and it's enough to get even a viewer.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at the case of this games than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers an Atemption.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of trampoline Tower is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">The goal is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or them prallt, the heavier heavier like an Astronaut, goes down, then down to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal to do not wölts into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant rise of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and final of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday morning also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will present the final as part of an afternoon block on two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably see in general Tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the consciousness was not reached by the anxiety and the lenses can be achieved - as the male US Turner according to the Wall Street Journal recently finished - then Mr. Dooley expects his to air, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protescent" in Ethiopia, Long A Former of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, on demand political changes in Ethiopia, are due to violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses tell witnesses, that there were a prototyping during the clashes of the police in Shussers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just trying to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid survey of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government appealed the country and extended to more areas in the last months.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people suffered thousands of people over the streets, and long-lasting political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was according to human rights agencies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen were killed and killed in an armed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the videos over the protests, which are presumably taken over the last or early of this year, how security and young people are forced to make a wall against a wall, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demanded an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country, and in the future," Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services working closely with the Ethiopians together to combat terrorist through the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, when at all, get a lot of western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy is expanding in a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendulum in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia had all other than a model for democracy, human rights organizations have continued to continuously rising repression through the government - the opposition in the country was restricted to the silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent into exile or in prison, or driven into the wilderness by the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people, and these don't miss any other options, apart from" "" "Seyoum Teshome," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopians." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the use of the soil, cover with regard to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After an extensive election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea, a battle about this delicate, contentious line needed in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts agree that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less forced, the turbo-bullets, and could be armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the bitrate after years before the end of Hinköchelns are to explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government approaches access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, many people are still able to communicate via the internet proxies, the conceal, where they keep up.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopian announced that they gathered themselves so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amhard as one of two largest cities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amhard as are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since its prospered, the amharas who come from aedics mainly Christian high countries, in politics and economics, while they live the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and are living in Flachland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that doesn't change this change.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos, the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-dangerous illness in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactic genius, a man who could remember corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly successful in it to take early signs of dissatisfaction and special instruct to edit opponents and make them unharmful to opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unbreakable reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region in the North of Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam came from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he did not include the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more blood.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, in 2005, the last time, in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to the data from the government, and subsequently by the government, it was stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razon, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time the rest was relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts in Ethiopian leaders for its visionary infrastructure, as the new Pendulum, as well as its measurable progress in the poverty line.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this is not the Intensification of the internal conflicts of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month's protectations in Gondar, a amharan city, by Tigray, run business, and hatred of the Tigray is still working in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst says that protests had the United States and other western associations in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently signed that base has closed.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he will not want to break his allies in one more volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin Gratemigration."</seg>

<seg id="7">The role was in contrast to the previous day, to which Mr. Trump in a number of interviews said, he said the petitioning completely seriously.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think it is clever enough to keep his testimonies enough, so that they can be interpreted in different kind and way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sound to the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has passed an even more sound because its frafractions will have gone back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal, Marist, was published on Friday, a guided tour of the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocate statements, he accused him to understand his critics, or understand his testimonies, or understand his testimony.</seg>

<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitime, political comments, saying, Mr. Giuliani, he asked for the judge of Mr. Trumps, asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense, that by Obama ISIS had an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-singing, completely wrong, and therefore it happened, because he went to Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government knew under Obama, who served as Secretary Clinton's Secretary of State, has allowed to spread the situation in the Middle East and aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the electoral events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump set his attacks on the media, and threw them to move on each of his words, and went against him.</seg>

<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rock works and it was freshly baked to breakfast, lunch and dinner served.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Americans were the Americans that went to starving Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" draws on the way to which the country went to country, not to be the saffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time, in the food for the Americans a central, balanced theme," says Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is nearly 400 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2">More rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland should only come in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea on board of the research ship Sanna into the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is a swimming pool with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only been working with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greenland expedition at the Greenland expedition at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it arrives at an average of 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it gets down to it, the five metre long animal goes on a smooth 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This contraceptive lifestyle, however, seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of Copenhagen at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at a Greenland expedition, which might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Wahnsense", "says Alexander Schick of Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist had already been long that Greenland will be stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland are difficult to observe. finally, they are mainly in the Eismeer, in front of the low density coast of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they have water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, diving in the surface is usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle know a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentempt reaches out, when they came out six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed himself.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them or patrol on the ground of the Eismeeres and look at the Kadaver that descended from higher water layers according to the downsides.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as the head of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 was centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method of the lens in Haie.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of eye linse is already before the birth of the Haie, which in which the proteins are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest Haie had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth should therefore be, therefore, in the early 1960s, larger amounts of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere causes a greater amount of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the aftermath of 220 centimeters long, it contained a low excess of carbon-14 in the nuclear chamber, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All bigger Greenland branch had in their lens in the normal carbon-14 amounts, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-o showed a 493 centimetre long Greenland expedition as an age of 335 years, while the Rekord Hai can be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only got up offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length of a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably due to the threshold of sexual activity, and his age was determined by 156 years, Grönlandhaie can be obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">It should be the world record for vertebrates currently.</seg>
<seg id="33">Such as Methusaleme live in particular in eisies, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also, the previous record holder, a 211-year old Grönlandwal, which was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught on Alaska in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures, often the body of the animals live on the flame of flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you pass later - and again slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals also become very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">So, "a small animal lives in this and should concentrate to concentrate as many children as early as early as early as early as early as many children, says the evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal was to invest in a long life, rather than in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took his role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his legend, and made the legend of legend when he came home to home a victory over the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England Undrawn up four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals at Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="5">They finished the trick, after they took place in March at the train world championships in London despite the trafespan of Hoys only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this time as a Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to close kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential when they saw the potential when they saw it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, passwords - four years ago with Hoy's finished - and skinner in the qualifications round a Olympiarsenord, but in the standard drdrone, New Zealand came to defeat in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Having returned after his round, but Password brought the team to the front and scrub.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change in strategy made a major part of the transformation which drove to the execution of a higher speed, to slow him a slow and it password, and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as a BBC expert, and fell Skinner, password, and Hindes, when they were on the podium finish.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm only here to do my best to do and I have a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We are placed in the final round one Olympiarekord and the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After victory in 2012 on the site of password and tesys, Hindes stated that he fell from a weak start to the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He moved this statement later, and there came no objection of England.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time this time there was no problem for this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said, "it feels like all GB flags on the triflush such as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come to the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come with so many world titles so bad, that it was incredible to win again with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that a barometer of our progress in the last five months is, we anticipates successful five days at Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form's shape, it is in the realm of possibility that he won the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be born on March 23, younger than Hoy, who also was born on 23 March (one seems that he was born on 23 March), Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister (born on the day) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="34">It can win with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It will feel something to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Note: "if he won two more gold medals, he should be beaten to Knight knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only Medazzling competition of the day, but there were further good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the Vierer-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They came in 3: 51.942 at the goal.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competitors, at the Wiggins on the day.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with beards before the qualification, when the function called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, the morning continued and finished, and finally, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving up to its strong railway team in order to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a shame to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to a truly remarkable depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations were down for Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">In April, Dramas played in the background, as well as the resignation of the technical guidance Shane Sutton, in the middle of April at the heart of sex and Mobbingbroth as well as the retiring of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you see the first night of the competition in the Velodrom show, it looks quite soon as the legendary reputation GBS, who has reached the perfect moment his climax, again, again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was according to the projections of a new NASA climate models probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, which are similar to those of climafers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus can be used with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once have been proved to be similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously shown that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have a thin, low-like atmosphere, nevertheless could be slow to further.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lighted also the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet showed that more dry areas as de Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life to accommodate life and more intense.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus were also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation exponated the slow revolution of the Sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio, in an press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heated the surface and produces rain, which makes a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella due to the surface of a bulk of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average-temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles that of evolution resembles the evolution of planner research.</seg>

<seg id="15">Their oceans, evaporated and their water vapour was burned down by the ultra-violet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know today.</seg>

<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a Opfator, it is searching for unlong modified files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">This files encrypted the Ransomware and solves the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software will be presenting the requirements of the compressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims of money, mostly in the form of crash.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, it's for companies to provide sensitive data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage increases, if there is a Ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales by Ransomware, 13 percent had to break the business activities, in case of a case of people in life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several times were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of health acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say to the victims," "" "this promotes the problem" "" "Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that have to pay their data.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject in view of the perpetrators in the operation of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The chipper turn again and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the F-Secure security researchers have investigated and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to build more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do you explain their victims of the chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, free online websites or decrypn for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be able to pay attention to payments by a few hundred euros, companies have to pay partially hard-beat and five digit sums, to obtain their data.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively high risk of profits from the Ransomware compressors, the Hacker will always be professional and share, explains security experts from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person may write a Ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their damage, then in the form of a software construction to the actual compressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The pre-Malware kits created by the malware self, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is a adapting tool to be changed, so smaller configurations, appearance, and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The compressors are looking for further hacker to spread the fresh software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you logged in one of the forums on the ground, it buys the set of a criminals and to install one another, to install the software to as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per domestic computers.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then apply spammer with the dissemination," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that get their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Via 50 percent of the companies IT developers in the Malwarebytes-survey, Ransomware can rely on with file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already revised new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data is not sufficient threat to successful business, the perpetrators" instead with the publication of sensitive data like approximately customer lists or price loss, "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the potential of damage to type of data according to type of data is much higher than earlier.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even, the perpetrators could also be completely new goals on the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackl Conference, Defcon had demonstrated security researchers, as they were able to play with the Internet of thermostatic under its control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation in a so-called heating so many victims could be worth a solver value.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then able to block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also be a theme in the Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial of 94, cannot be heard by uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whatever the violence is concerned, it is obvious: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which were definitely not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it right in the Rigolites already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, their road is not a criminal fuel point, on the contrary, "here it helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more each other than any other."</seg>
<seg id="30">New gebauer is aware of the Rigolite road - and remained in the Rigoga Street.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the natives were withdrawn up their road, by the police, the politics and the media, who all over all over the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of berries such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by the disputes of newly built new buildings in former Baulgaps, who burned the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are all condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction I can't use any gutheirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you ask for if a never?</seg>
<seg id="36">Here, on all sides frustration is a, also at the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the drawn, that was about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has a little understanding: the great projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws up, should be aware that - exactly how somebody, who moves into a pub in a pub that can complain very hard about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons were asked for people with their right name, don't have to name it with their right name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle contracted the refugee camps for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as contact person for all actors: refugees, working refugee, administration, authorities and who are otherwise still included.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shelf customer from the Arbeitskreis Konjunktur: indicate that the honorary report has now been grateful that Deuschle now is, the eigh of Wollmildeau that is especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So, some - less spelling than rather on the multitude of wish-to-do-wish, meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for an administrative force in a talent for languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, just a eitic of mildeau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administration work was not a central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, there is an organization that work with people in place and also behind the scenes as well as network of network.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the highest time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle honors and principal official actors supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem is that for some time, appartments are approved for connecting forces which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For connecting rooms, the municipal utilities are in charge.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations, have to carry the local themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is moving from the landing office of the Commune, and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the administration doesn't find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has so far not so far, we are able to instructed about private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the apartments must be ventilated, as it is so nice.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße into the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, training places, training places, training places, training sessions, A-Euro jobs and emirate for refugees and migrants have to be found.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places are good," reports Regine customer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="32">Many works in the building yard or help house champions, do not do not for non-profit work - and motivates, and very tidy, such as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">They hopes that the job for the church is a positive impact in a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But not only work, but not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day would have a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a confidence-feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there's offers as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So, you can jump here in management and honorary membership.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is centrally, that the refugees get the feeling they were in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to declare the refugees that it takes place and can be meaningful. for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever looks like sometime the feeling of development, he could not work in Urbach anyone did not work and be unprofitable, who will never be able to integrate it.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">This problem is also, "people say honestly," people who doesn't know anything else. "the work of Deuschle and customer may still be motivated to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">This was already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two according to recent events are afraid of radicalization, even in a small village such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client quite clearly, "what manned naiv I'll call it." a residual risk could not close it.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized to the helper.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">The fear of fear that the attacks they have complete completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"you want to show that they have nothing to do," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So you need to keep main and honorary volunteer on site and in the region, according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have always in the background, that soon, a new Stocks could come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Needs Germany a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is too cruel and to set helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we want," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, which would relax the location.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes clear that the Urbacher can also be more reasonable to integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one may need to help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is complicated, as there is no simple answers.</seg>
