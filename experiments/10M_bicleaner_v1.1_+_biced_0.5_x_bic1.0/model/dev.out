Obama named Net@@ any@@ ahu
the ratio between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of international agreement as well as a moving mission in the Middle East .
however , in the meeting , it is also said to go to the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been eag@@ erly awaited for years .
Washington is critici@@ zed the ongoing population of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of progress during the peace process .
through the deal with Obama mentioned , the Iranian nuclear programme is deteri@@ or@@ ated and the relationship between the two further deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held an invitation to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the American Congress , which resi@@ ded the part of President Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had the preferred choice in Israel at the time .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend were shot and shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon lamb ( a little inferior voice ) that he shot his friend , and that he would have to pass in his house to his house .
lamb was very important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but I live and probably was excited ; and he said that the family contacts of dead men could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house he took all the officials from A@@ my Pr@@ ine@@ ss and a hand written reference , I told my hand , I love A@@ my and it is the only woman who told me . &quot; this was according to the authorities of the authorities in the letter , and he was written by lamb .
there was no indication that I had travelled to the grounds in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , he taught 300 miles on the grounds to the police , where he was assass@@ inated according to the police , E@@ than Schmidt , to be shot and killed in his office .
Delta State University and sign@@ atories Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University Eye employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hours .
he said that lamb received the disast@@ rous effects of the terrible disaster at some time .
until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb also took the life when the police re@@ en@@ cir@@ cled it .
another day after the shooting in the University , the students and Do@@ gger trading them to hide himself behind closed doors , the authorities always have to find a picture of it , just like the Lamb .
they presented by the investig@@ ators to both ends of the State , as well as that of those students and staff members looked upon him they were saying that a picture of an talented but probably difficult teacher .
students were saying that they were happy with his lesson .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er died where Pr@@ enti@@ er died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself had the Lamb who mentioned the written book , in which he mentioned &quot; wonderful people , &quot; to whom he divided his academic life .
both in the Department for Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some n@@ eig@@ tions to indicating any problems of problems .
a student , Bran@@ don hus@@ ks , the Lamb , said , He seemed to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb didn &apos;t tell him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014 @-@ 15 academic year .
lamb had previously been asked the Delta State University to have asked for health reasons , and said that he had a state of health .
he taught only two online courses in this year .
the latest amend@@ ment to the University &quot; policy is significant that the promotion , for the Lamb was working hard , for him no guarantee for a automatic way to feed as Assistant Assistant version .
Univers@@ it√© is William La@@ For@@ ge , who is nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s show . &quot;
these are not allowed to answer the Lamb .
after the flight from the Campus found the police later Lam@@ p trail , when he set up again in Mississippi , Ar@@ kan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , I found a pair of .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun on the back yard of a residence about a mile south of his parents at the edge of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the entrance .
it was not immediately figured that once we went to this house , but Johnson said that they knew that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew in the area .
lamb started his work in the university in 2009 , with about 12,000 inhabitants in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , teaching and educational science .
he has completed his PhD in spring in education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs called him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and fun .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb received 20 years , when they met through common friends .
she and their friends were in the high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried to teach her some years of guitar .
he was at the time of the women &apos;s army .
until then , all girls are mel@@ ted , he said to &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson pre @-@ suburb of Bran@@ don .
lamb and p@@ enti@@ sts were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I did mine my wife , &quot; but there were no documents of a marriage .
you had a dog from Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , which belongs to a Ba@@ you in a auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was in order .
the former husband of Pr@@ ism , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were bo@@ oted 15 years ago , but friends stayed , and had a daughter that was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .

I mean they had both a good sense for sh@@ ear .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the Theatre , and I wish , that the seat was still empty for me , and it &apos;s very clear that Princess Diana is very pleased with me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated and a Ar@@ mo@@ at length of it , to be the princ@@ ess of Wales in a date .

climate talks , there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Secretary Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his answer to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria , &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that lasted almost five years in conflict and more weapons , violence and mis@@ ery , killing millions of people .

8 conversion values , that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is very seriously .
some have tried to take him as the flop .
others have done it as a jo@@ ke .
and many await the collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have to try Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges in the p@@ olls , it still has not worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit post , and some are getting ready to wonder what the odds of a nom@@ ination of the real estate in Mo@@ ji@@ b .
of course there is still too early in the elect@@ oral term .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts predi@@ ct that , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership has been sold to the ascent of Herman Cain , a majority of whom no one has won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in any general election .
but foreign journalists such as J@@ eb &apos;s Super P@@ AC and the conservative economic group Club for Australia have now seen Tr@@ um@@ ps in the right to overthrow their dollar .
here are some current switching values that indicate that the real estate ho@@ gu@@ l does not only address a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps carries a popularity ratings of 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump on his ma@@ di@@ dat@@ or in mid @-@ June , a survey of the mouth study showed that only two of ten par@@ c@@ ays were seen in real estate in Mo@@ gu@@ l .
until mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of 10 say they have negative opinions .
these numbers are heading in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa , last week discovered that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ elect@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans who would be either &quot; excited about &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated once .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ ying , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates around the same enthusiasm such as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be , &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over the jump ) .
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republican strate@@ gi@@ ers say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ation , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps has not been a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump also critic@@ ises the statements for his bom@@ b@@ ings and it is likely that 52 percent of the Republican party elect@@ orate is that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is the right situation for its President , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered the initial state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he was a character of a saint , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent of what he is not the personality is to go effective . and nearly six of the 10 of independence , it is not the White House , the ABC / post office .
republi@@ can elect@@ ors are getting used to the idea .
if you can set up your money , republi@@ can slide vot@@ ers is written to real .
if asked what they are asked to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say that CNN / OR@@ C say one of the last week four out of ten such that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten July moved their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full dis@@ closure of GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ ers had not been the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this date , last year , four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lics indicated that Rick Per@@ ry won the nom@@ ination , and only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is reflected in a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as chat .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans himself up in order to win another candidate , pro@@ stag@@ land@@ marks were almost every one .
some experts have indicated that the un@@ sh@@ aw@@ ning field might be involved in a Tr@@ um@@ ps lead , while anti @-@ Tr@@ bic support is divided on more than a dozen of other candidates .
but the survey conducted at the mouth study at the beginning of September , demonstrated that at a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head @-@ races between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump also form@@ ulates the majority @-@ owned support .
he also wrote in the years before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before a total of 15 points , opposite the other 15 points , and finally in the border of Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ head @-@ head with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that thinks it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business@@ man with 19 points held in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ by @-@ head .
a crack majority of Donald &apos;s not@@ ump fans says , that they have made their opinion in your opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday , that only little over half of the elect@@ orate , can support Tr@@ ump , say that they have passed their voices .
of course , can happen much happened to change that , and no one can really say that never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they would have open the door to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps was the strongest competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but if he went out that they have established their opinion , twice as often as Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are subject to jump on the subject of migration .
since John Tr@@ ump in his elect@@ oral campaign , Donald Tr@@ ump in Russia - he called &quot; rape , &quot; the migration and a fishing point in the public flo@@ urs to 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of tr@@ ump is understood by Tr@@ ump @-@ Americans by the Republican Party and shall keep the further sustainability efforts .
but by the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans who agree with Tr@@ ump at questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration falling off the spotlight will have been , however , Donald Tr@@ ump is also apparent .
the fru@@ stration expressed on new levels stands .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republican strate@@ gi@@ ers are roughly half of the support of Republican elect@@ ors , especially by their out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new assembly of ABC / post , they would prefer to have a political cli@@ pping .
and they are also w@@ alled to Washington .
a study conducted by In Mo@@ li@@ ines / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans , who are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans of 54 % , &quot; being &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 % &quot; pol@@ ish . &quot;

&quot; at Sy@@ lt , the company is limited to objects of objects , &quot; it is in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which special layers costs one square meter .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ k in Munich are not really quiet .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residence , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .

before new he found Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario G√∂@@ tze , after a mus@@ cular age back on the squ@@ ad@@ ron , was initially sitting outside .

during the first change the Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to refer to him as King@@ sley Com@@ an for him ( 5@@ 9th ) .

the good news : with case defects decreases the risk quickly .

people who heard about the smoke , could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers believe in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it might be over ten years , until the risk of endanger@@ ing again on the level of non @-@ smokers , stated the first author Thomas Dietrich , of the English University of Birmingham .
we would have to convince man for his non @-@ smoking , study group leader H@@ einer Boeing and DI@@ F@@ E : &quot; smoke from the lifetime . &quot;

he is told about different places , that he recorded back on the map &#93; , what about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and z@@ art arrangements were reports .
where they were originated , and how it looks there to be in his homeland .
since this time Stev@@ ens gives up as wonderful creative ir@@ ony .
from 2003 to 2003 and launching its third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; we composed songs that perfectly be perfectly distributed exclusively to American Folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fting at any time .
it is the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; was the first part of a we@@ en@@ ites series : each of the 50 US states has to be taken down@@ stream in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has appeared and collap@@ ses in its own expectations .
greatly reduced Stev@@ ens here .

a year later , the musician goes back to the series in New York .

the album increases to the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing not every year @-@ list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens was transferred in &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , which offers an extensive electronic cat@@ cher .
that sixth full studio album will still be orchest@@ rated and orchest@@ rated by programming or beats , and plays with all kinds of effect and Hall .
after all the smaller clubs , the stage shows are touring with the colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on , head@@ bands , and large fluores@@ cence .

in the dark area of 2014 there is More ...

even though almost 2000 guests are crazy about their chairs , the well @-@ known glass concerns go back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the public , the group enjoys excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album .
from the audience , one sounds : the lecture is &quot; poor so@@ called &quot; and you could break the &quot; plate in the per@@ ation . &quot;
unfortunately , Stev@@ ens &apos;s modest , just twenty @-@ few older songs and , finally , tos@@ sing into the face of the appl@@ ause .

Met@@ a launches proximity control for the control of Al@@ di@@ - inser@@ ting
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A stores before an Al@@ di troops in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale dealers in cash has launched a detailed review of the medium to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia to protect some 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di opens the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia to offer their relations with local food suppliers , and buy the IG@@ A brand by Main@@ stream marketing and marketing of social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers on board , including brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , whose shops in IG@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop owner who sells cheap tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that the two other details of his defense strategy will be released on Sept . 29 , when the wholesale dealers for food , alcohol and equipment will be consistently taking over the annual investors strategy .
it stands lots of to the game , as South Australia and Western Australia is almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A charging services and higher profits as well as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers of South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ arized in South Australia and Western Australia , with a significantly more advanced share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in Western Australia as well as 24 percent in Western Australia as opposed to about 14 per cent in Western Australia .
however , analysts how Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of his first markets , roughly five percent of the food market in these two states are rolled up all the actors , but mostly stand @-@ independent retailers sales .
a report published in this week according to the Analy@@ st Tom Ki@@ er@@ ath by Morgan Stanley , that IG@@ A retail@@ er who want to lose ‚Ç¨ 360 million in cash from $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
it is based on the assumption that Al@@ di is close to 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and which will achieve a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
paying some $ 13 million in cash before interest and taxes , in the case of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , the interest paid $ 13 million in interest and taxes , Mr Ki@@ er@@ ath said .
at the same time , the bonus of cash shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently carried out survey of Roy Morgan had discovered that IG@@ A buyers access to share .
Morgan Stanley , that the company &apos;s sales in food and grocery store cost by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 % in 2018 , and a market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading Fon@@ ds@@ Project Ham@@ mam Dou@@ glass , founder of the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , posted in Melbourne this year that the balance will probably be in a decade .
in order to react rapidly , publicly dis@@ able at the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ 2.2 with Mr Dou@@ glass has had to take care of this week .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has decreased by 18 percent to 14 percent in 2010 , and income from metal oxide , food ration and food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , resulting in its operating loss in real @-@ time pressure on revenues and margins .
the merchant , however , turns its decision in sales with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week to improve their shops in order to improve their businesses by growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label food products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive of Ian Mor@@ rice said that the price cuts and charging fees for El@@ an will be expected to see that the wholesale dealers will return to return in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is being supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
however , Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deser@@ ves praise to be a criticism of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ an@@ akis was one of the coll@@ agen for his friend Nick Hu@@ gios and deser@@ ved his view to the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ y , following a result of criticism against its own behavior .
Kok@@ ro@@ akis , a leader of the talented du@@ os , presented as described as &quot; Special Editions &quot; presented by the renowned mir@@ ro@@ red ruling by St@@ an Wa@@ v@@ r@@ ka in the Montreal Masters line .
in a full qualifying match in Cincinnati , they had to be carried out and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice due to the arbit@@ er and said , &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA , it was supposed to have proclaimed , and I should grab the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a lot of floating around the potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , the coconut will be defended from he@@ aly stand .
the teen@@ ager is currently playing Glasgow , playing a 2nd place finish in a single room behind Bernard To@@ mic at the stadium @-@ final against Great Britain in 2011 .
&quot; a thing about which I walked with very good effect , is the fact that according to my view Th@@ an@@ asi became a little bit over the war , &quot; said He@@ aly said .
he measured a pun@@ ches of having lost in the US Open , but it &apos;s not the first player to broken out a bat of Fr@@ ust with themselves , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has got extremely well in the US Open extremely well , even with the rather prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances of India and so on , and I think it deser@@ ves much recognition .
he did a great team around me , he had a great family around , and I think that he was not yet supported yet .
he is a very successful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he has been very hard , and he fits perfectly with the other players , he is hard in shape , it &apos;s a very stable and advanced young talent , and I think it is deser@@ ves to be evaluated according to its own services .
He@@ y also supported the decision to take into account the very important decision theory that will take place on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision , &quot; and he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long lasting figure to return . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ es un@@ ship around &#91; Kyr@@ kan &#93; , &quot; said Tom@@ aly .
and I think they didn &apos;t have to climb to him , and who knows it &apos;s appoint@@ ing for him , but we try to give him the consequences of his retail , to which he can only think about him . I think it is best for him , and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains not@@ ary , closes the border , with@@ drew refugees
Hungary explains the emergency occupation with Serbia and ur@@ ged the border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all the way , she attempted to stop illegal in the country . everything in the objective of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed in the border , as hundreds of migrants lost in a ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian civil servants with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
people who had fled from violence in refuge on the road , were buried in a strip of land along the road between the two security points of the country , and settled here .
but breakfast were advanced .
when a police station screw@@ ed on them , the association &quot; open the border ! &quot; and cried out against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police .
some forced food and water repeatedly .
the Foreign Minister , Secretary of State , was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants could be returned from Hungary and arrive from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be a solution of the solution and not a collapse .
it must take place in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic to Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ action at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy was conven@@ ed .
however , the Minister agreed to share 40,000 people who had sought refuge in Italy and Greece who finally made their hope for the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement reached an agreement reached with 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Tuesday one special summit on the European Union to discuss the im@@ migrant crisis of the continent .
however , in Hungary , however , his hopes were not on an early action of Brussels or by his neighbours .
on Tuesday , the emergency surgical intervention in two southern regions , however , there were more powers to tackle the crisis so that they have been shut down and asylum seek@@ ers .
the Hungarian foreign minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ yar@@ to , said that his country has also planning the construction of a ti@@ led @-@ up by his border to Rum@@ ania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants over the country by having a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even hand@@ lers were employed in the competition , called bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were used .
in the last months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and elsewhere in the Middle East , with a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point for the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had insi@@ sted that the most of the countries of business is now looking for a better life , and not to constitute a view which states a view to other EU nations , including Germany .
the new laws to come into Hungary in Norway , make the limit on the border or damage to the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) tall , passing the government along the southern border to Serbia with a crime . this laws and sentenced to prison terms for human yo@@ dels .
&quot; because of the situation , which are ar@@ isen by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared its state of emergency , &quot; said Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ters , in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal migration planning is a crime .
the parliament has to agree that for the future of the military , however , agree that for next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have had to attack on the border with vehicles and dogs to be there .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have accumulated 30 people in attempts to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
you come near by doing the fence , soon they are now in custody and accused of crimes by crimes in the new laws .
the authorities are here to repair the fence .

election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s second lead against Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins its opposite side .
Clinton increased the support for 47 per cent of democratic vot@@ ers to the election ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( in the increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who is not previously announced if he was promoted to the presidential office , receives the support of 15 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the fore@@ front .
over five months before the beginning of the election , most of democratic vot@@ ers say it has to be early to say that your opinion , which candidates have to support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters - the one who are known member of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demographic component , while S@@ anders scored a few win@@ nings .
Clinton receives a wide lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections did not have .
their support for the men is lower , and S@@ anders is back here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ ica The men of democratic vot@@ ers under 50 have vent@@ ured over 50 years ago , and she and S@@ anders are now equal to the same height .
however , Clinton has just a big head start with the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was putting him with double @-@ digit lead in the liberal , but S@@ anders increased a 5 @-@ point advantage over this group .
in half of the democratic vot@@ ers in vain , they say that they would support their enthusiasm to Clinton , when she would be nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some advantages and support another 15 percent , they would only support it as the securing line .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps you may be surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters , mostly of her are thrilled .
the views are more mixed with less than those who are Clinton not support - only about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers can say that they say Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can elect@@ orate is this on its leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
while Clinton &apos;s supporting support is in an open question , why it &apos;s the most common response to the previous experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the fact that it &apos;s time that a woman President is President ( 13 per cent ) and that it &apos;s the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also supports their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
the agreement with the problems and the vot@@ ers are also quoted .
as the Vice @-@ President had a potential for the Presi@@ dency in the Wa@@ ag@@ aves , 57 percent of democratic vot@@ ers want him to see him in the race - although one @-@ third are believed that it should not do it .
if the elections did not choose the fore@@ front , who would be for the party its second choice , Bi@@ den is on top of the board .
by Clinton &apos;s tra@@ ilers , more than half of that Bi@@ den would be the second choice before S@@ anders .
join Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Demok@@ rates of loose , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head start over 30 points without him on the race for 30 points without him .
by five @-@ five percent of the democratic elect@@ orate , Clinton &apos;s candidate reaches the best chance of getting this choice , however , that a total number of 78 percent has fallen to the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in these measurement , but the percentage , who looks him as the &quot; select &quot; . &quot;
nevertheless , in the question afterwards , what if the candidates is an important , the French vot@@ ers call for the elect@@ ors .
similarly , as in the last month , no more democratic candidate , or potential candidate for the elect@@ oral candidate , appears to be un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are good results of several major features for vot@@ ers in the election of their party .
search also consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and is equipped with strong leadership .
Bi@@ den wins the three candidates for hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic vot@@ ers believe that Clinton hon@@ est@@ ly and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it &apos;s twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion from him .
democratic vot@@ ers of the elections in general are Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ j@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , roughly a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers did not have any opinion from S@@ anders .
since asked to Hillary Clinton &apos;s record , a personal e @-@ mail address and a Ser@@ vers during the term of Foreign Affairs , are the most Democratic vot@@ ers in favour of the affair with their declaration , saying that there have not been a decision of the opinion .
but it is a total of other history in the American public .
half of the Americans is now un@@ happy with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans have said that the email has no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , though 36 percent said , that their opinion have been deteri@@ or@@ ated .
there are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 , who say that their beli@@ efs have become Clinton bad .
even though Clinton is watched by the elect@@ ors of her party as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is to consider a problem for it under registered civil war . only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voting rights keep it not for a honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights are also inv@@ alu@@ able also , as well as tru@@ st@@ worthy and not tru@@ st@@ ably .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump is good notes in the guide .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush the best way .
a majority looks S@@ differently than honest , but like at Car@@ son , have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 . elect@@ orate is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son puts on current survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump on Austria .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times , behind Donald Tr@@ ump .
on the two candidates , half of the elect@@ orate falls in the new phase , and others are neg@@ li@@ gible .
Republican elect@@ ors are hand @-@ taking tr@@ ump in large number . the support has been growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate in the past month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the pol@@ l revealed that Car@@ ls@@ x made a good again , and a jump on Republican elect@@ ors with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ ze , who is out of the once out of Wis@@ ni@@ in , who has fallen down@@ right at the deepest , rising from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida &apos;s governor , J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas , Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida chief Marco Ru@@ bio are at a third place in the third place .
the correction data for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons by rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son goes up in p@@ olls - he lan@@ det at 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans who jump back with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post shows also Tr@@ unk clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with view to one in the last week , rising to Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some page image for the former neuro@@ surgery , even after Car@@ son decided to ask the pro@@ um@@ ps of faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood , with the death of a Bar@@ bie College in Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student during an event@@ ful use as a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , lam@@ inated against the plot against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ ber college P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI Techni@@ que Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g was brut@@ ally confirmed and delayed his transport to the hospital , which led to his death in September 2013 .
officials were saying that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly det@@ ach@@ uted , while he tried to enter into a frozen field on a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell the consciousness .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ bro@@ therhood is not : it did not call the emergency number 911 , after den@@ u@@ di@@ ally and waited another hour before they put him in a hospital , the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ &apos;s clothing to change his symptoms , goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to enter the Council , said police officers Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , members , to hide about the fossi@@ ls of having measured and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood , on which by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police .
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died in the next morning .
after an autop@@ si@@ e@@ report , Den@@ g was repeated with silent strength of the head , tor@@ so @-@ and @-@ th@@ igh@@ bones .
&quot; so many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student , since 1970 , a year in the Shi@@ kan@@ es , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ es family , in a statement .
bru@@ ises and their members need to be moved to comp@@ ut@@ ations , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended for the charges of ho@@ mi@@ cide on the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , will also be indicted on the Shi@@ p attacks and also a criminal organisation .
&quot; we are not only responsible for the participating person , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this will be concerned , then we will consider this to comp@@ ut@@ ment &quot; , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ bie College has banned the Brotherhood , and the Brotherhood rejected her aff@@ i@@ ority .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest rate is taken , and the house is also hit , return on bonds , and the economy will lead to a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will last and how long it will hold .
in particular , the story provides only small guidance on the time .
a recession made in only 11 months , following the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggression is the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates , is often , if not always , a factor is able to react like the economy and financial facilities .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank &apos;s asser@@ tion that investors will not concentrate on it , when they starts to increase the interest rates , but rather is at the time that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables will play a role .
on the end , market participants came to recognize that the entire isolation was possibly dem@@ ol@@ ished due to a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; budget &quot; report , &quot; said Julian E@@ so@@ p , Chief econ@@ omist at Capital Economics , in a message from clients .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest rates for normal heights , but still at low level , to appear for the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a current trends that are re@@ acting on how some areas of the economy would react :
as the market has seen last month , the capture of zinc die for you are volatile for a while .
as soon as the increase is not present , the influence is not so dramatic .
it seems to be a tendency that asset inf@@ lows were , 12 to 24 months after the entry of the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German Bank analysts agree to a new study which happens to be the interest of the F@@ ed .
in the past 35 years , most of this past 35 years ( average income of 2.6 % ) , then return to the higher income after 500 days , with an average return to eight percent according to a recent analysis , according to Bob D@@ oll , chief complex strategy manager at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the en@@ um cycle and returns , making up again , making up again .
con@@ v@@ ables are a fact of economic life , but also c@@ aries promote education .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not accelerate , and accelerate the recession .
remarkable is the fact that the gross domestic product is in the proximity of its lowest point in a interest rate equal to the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate have been increased significantly twice on the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 amounted to 3.6 percent , few of that continues for the third quarter and remember the third quarter the Atlanta F@@ ed data is only 1.5 percent .
type of interest in a so fra@@ gil@@ en economic setting could be risk and disc@@ ard the question , &quot; if it is different , &quot; the German Bank said .
market participants have performed the whole year to a interest rate in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and economi@@ sts believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures sale demands a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all enhancement cycles have taken place from 1950 to today in a Super cycle with increasing sw@@ ung in GDP and pre @-@ recession , very fast after the start of recovery in the sh@@ adows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was observed .
the current cycle is by far the longest , have been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , so the record was 35 months , and so far are 74 months .
hard @-@ income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market has increased a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is qui@@ cker than in common shares if its strategic target is .
from bonds , the yields seemed to change the direction of turning once the first increase of its reduction in the cycle is calculated .
at the end of the e @-@ cycle time , the Bank dropped immediately , said the German Bank .
the strategy of Charles Schw@@ ab , however , indicates that the increase in interest rates do not result , returns , longer and short@@ ened bonds in the curve and lead to a cancellation of the curve .
they are often recommended on bonds , often in such a bad result , even though &quot; we have more carried more recommen@@ dable to come higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st for Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what is interesting , Jones writes that the markets have already adapted to the F@@ ed strategy management system .
&quot; next to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are a few signs of evidence that the market has change in the rise to the higher @-@ level monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest have increased significantly , the Er@@ ten@@ ants is sw@@ apping , credit @-@ spots as well and the vol@@ atility in industry - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed its strategy are tigh@@ tened .
in the big and all , companies that will make the larger parts of its business in the US , will profit , if interest rates will increase and local products even more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are worse than they expect , as a increasing number of dollars would sell their products on the global market , making it the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality - &quot; shares are to react to extremely positive , three months after initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs and Analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
firms with a strong balance sheet , respon@@ ding to the interest rate in the 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , resulting in an average 5 percentage points .
businesses with high capital imports and lower vol@@ atility in their shares are outstanding for their equivalent amounts by an average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a large problem .
companies with a high share of interest rates are for@@ going to lose , Gold man said .
outside the pure share games are also likely to profit by the rising dollar .
savings could see gains of higher income , even if experts are of different opinions , how fast it is going to take place .
BBC Radio 3 , a copy of the classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary , Andrew B@@ ingham
the con@@ doms is a member of the Parliament , critic@@ ised the broadcaster for his &quot; failure . &quot;
he argued that he is increasingly distinct from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also played on the BBC Music Awards and told that she was only the Br@@ its i@@ mi@@ zed
Parliament @-@ based Dami@@ en Collins has been a member of the Voice Competition , and said that this is not really original .
BBC Radio 3 , &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , claiming a leading a@@ U@@ M and increases new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that it does not do anything to do the private station .
the con@@ doms , Andrew B@@ ingham said , in addition to the BBC Bos@@ sen said that the public @-@ legal radio stations will &quot; ev@@ ep@@ um@@ me &quot; and is increasingly recognized by its commercial competitors .
&quot; Radio 3 - I use the word &quot; ev@@ ap@@ it@@ ters &quot; - but it seems to turn on Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also played on the BBC Music Awards , which started in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started in the past year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under one another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different , this are every page example , in which you actually are using what is already on the market , &quot; Mr Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC General Manager has re@@ fut@@ ed and argued that the BBC Radio 3 goes far beyond its commercial competitors if it goes to the public for live @-@ music and education .
what I &apos;m sorry about Radio 3 ler@@ ne , that I will be broadcast on classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really well exceeded .
&quot; and we can find the commitment of radio 3 , new music and to give new works to him , I consider also really important to us , &quot; he said .
the earlier this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that they had to be working closely involved in the public , as they had been doing so in the past , because the British have fewer than classical music .
but radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the ear@@ thly fair for the selection of culture , media and sports related to fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on feet .
the T@@ ory MP , Dami@@ en Collins has been a voice at the BBC - the musical talent show of BBC , which was bought by Dutch manufacturers Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million ¬£ .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original , and not most striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he was interested that the company had a hit in our house stable since the next time , &quot; if it was the next time a entertainment series .
however , he refused to exp@@ el the order for the further series of The Voice in the future , or choose the money of the fee programme for other entertainment formats .
internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
last month , the lowest result was the lowest since the start of the record in 2000 .
online @-@ sales increased three years ago by the use of cell phones over the cell phones .
experts estimate that in November the Black Friday filed in November 2003
for more than a decade the virtual shop has o@@ om@@ ite , and many of the main shopping streets , Great Britain may have turned in a gh@@ ost town .
however , experts predi@@ ct that today , the online revenues were stagn@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the budget makes provision for August , the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that new numbers are stagn@@ ating , after giving new numbers only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; if you have growth rates for years of years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sale book with the gu@@ ardian angel .
he declared that the online sales was strengthened by three years ago , when buyers were working with their mobile phone .
a result that more people were online , and they could already do that in different environments , such as home on the sofa .
but now g@@ un@@ ed itself , we must see that growth is reduced .
the black Friday natural phenomenon which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the subsequent revenues .
experts believe that buyers will stop their shopping before that event taking place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to move around their computer to make their bar@@ gains , and also had a few dealers sites .
experts estimate that Black Friday , the buyer will be tu@@ cked to the buyer for bar@@ gains , buyer will be able to make shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium thought that of ¬£ 5 output was issued in excess of ‚Ç¨ 1 ¬£ .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of the shopping is carried out over Web @-@ Shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of man made clothes and shoes online rather than in the brood @-@ workers in the interior cities .

function@@ aries by ai@@ ch / DO@@ B for un@@ faithful before Court
the District Court of Klagenfurt is proud to have two officials of the Austrian volleyball merchant Pi@@ one@@ er / DO@@ B as his faithful and un@@ restra@@ int on Wednesday .
the accused ple@@ a not guilty .
one of them was also indicted for abuse of abuse .
from this presentation , it was also acqu@@ itted in May by final judgment .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Ober@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the indic@@ tees that the def@@ endant was approved in the years 2006 to 2011 and the cases of those who were able to disp@@ ose in their function for private purposes .
the damage increases with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sport work are also charged with financial schemes .
this factor , the chairman of the che@@ que , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired .
it should be negotiated with a later date .
the defence of the ini@@ ence also showed the defence that the association was not wholly owned by a member .
the Sport@@ so@@ therapy had only been committed to the sports club and they have invested in the sports club in which they have invested much time and money invested in the beginning of 1982 - the Passi@@ va came out around 600@@ ,000 ch@@ illing ( approximately 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) in the year 2001 .
at the time we stood before the situation : do we lead the club on or to say ? , &quot; says one of the accused , in the bre@@ e@@ work of the financial sector .
with his colleague and fellow def@@ endants , he decided to take this task .
risks are few risks .
&quot; we decided to have money from having done health insur@@ ances as security of the Bank , &quot; he said the arrest .
the association has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , only no debts are allowed .
furthermore , with corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the withdrawal policy was retro@@ sp@@ ectively created until 1991 .
hence , I have a part of the allow@@ ances of only years later , that by 2003 , when a plus had been paid to his account .
therefore , too , Pau@@ ve@@ - and non @-@ detail shots , explained the former Ob@@ lig@@ mann information .
the accounts and savings of the accused were charged on the two accused , the second accused , saying .
why the pay@@ outs came not in detail in detail , the judge asked the judge .
the association should not be interested in detail for the financial situation , important should only be the real risk of debt , so the answer .
in the year 2011 , against the killing of an investigation for abuse of authority , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was rejected to the club .
these were all def@@ endants .
the statement of securities ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and , according to the club &apos;s testimony was not known .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know the judge .
in fact , the question@@ n@@ did not reply for a long time .
then he said that he believed , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened something happened , nobody knew nothing from that money , the prosecutor requested in the room .
the co @-@ accused should have been informed , justi@@ fying the function .
the transfer has been issued as &quot; damages . &quot;
why damages account ? , wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
the first accused but to agree with this formulation , because the society did never dis@@ agree with that formulation .
but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; you are all of the sons of Schneider . &quot;
&quot; am I am a legal representative ? , &quot; is asking this .
in addition , the Fun@@ ction said , he never had a p@@ enny of salary for him , to kill o@@ bo@@ unt@@ y and di@@ ets .
he created the association 1,000 euros a month in calculation , but the actual effort was much higher but added to the association .
all necessary documents were not able to prove the indic@@ tees .
these are after a le@@ ak detection , where everything has been judged as correct , no more kept .
kilomet@@ er@@ y also had a second def@@ endant in the second accused .
all book@@ ings are performed in bar , so he has to lead them from his place of international residence on the bank to Blei@@ burg . he stated in his statement .
the main hearing is continued with the hearing in 23 September with the hearing of witnesses .

according to Dutch Cor@@ respon@@ dent in D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , the violence proce@@ eded to the border checks .
telephone written by telephone :
a group of refugees broke out the border .
but behind it was a police line , and behind the police there was a water column .
40 to 50 Syrian refugees began to cast off , bum@@ ps and plastic bottles by the local elections .
the official ranked of all on the Pfe@@ ffer@@ le spray .
after that the police used the police .
there is much Tr@@ √§n@@ eng@@ as in the direction of the refugees .

the refugees now have with@@ drawn it back now .

time the decision concerning rates of interest rates for the US need
the world is observed , if the US Emergency database is coming in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the crucial decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest has been raised or not .
a survey conducted by 80 economi@@ sts , who were provided by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do so much longer than the last week , we think that the F@@ ed will hold yet slightly longer and the interest rates will be at its current rate 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is an historic event because it was seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest has been syn@@ dic@@ ated to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach to a situation in which a large European Central Bank will leave the zero area and starts a process that starts the norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said : U@@ bide , Leit@@ ner employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is based on a relatively high performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generating only a few inflation .
however , F@@ ed can ignore the much ro@@ l@@ ated outlook to global ratios .
it is warned of the markets taking its increasing , but the signs argue that the odds of a step is good in such a step .
the judges will be announced at 20 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
death @-@ protective at Delta State University and had ap@@ pre@@ school
after his friend and his friend placed in the direction of Mississippi on Monday morning , he wrote Sh@@ annon Lamb a note about to say that it was &quot; tired of the first violent man , &quot; he could not make him going , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in the auti@@ er length of Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer of ge@@ ography and social life education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
he said he had been killed and someone killed .
lamb said the staff of the emergency call , that the police chs had to send police to his home .
he said , &quot; I smote my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; no one has existed , &quot; but probably he will be surprised . &quot;
the police asked the sur@@ fer to his name but he didn &apos;t exist him .
lamb gave no explanation for its shots .
as a police spi@@ ked , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ine@@ ers , 41 , and a hand written reference of lamb , 45 , the author : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to end it to end .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , the number 300 miles into Delta State University , where he found E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history and killed him , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were killed him .
Univers@@ it√© is William La@@ For@@ ge , who is nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s show . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb is believed that Pr@@ inde@@ er had a relationship with Schmidt , saying , &quot; No information , no Evi@@ dence &quot; for one &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ine@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were about seven years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were mel@@ ted before 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ al@@ ss , a daughter of 19 is , and it was destroyed &quot; at the floor . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ inde@@ er raised her daughter &apos;s absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ inde@@ er worked online from home , based on L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ism as a close friend of Pr@@ ism .
Know@@ les testi@@ fied that p@@ enti@@ ves , which had a dog called Light@@ ning , had received with lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said that I was called a relative to a certain period of Monday to tell them , &quot; He will not go to prison . &quot;
when police killed him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , later in this night , I ro@@ uted the car to the side , fled by foot , walked in the forest and suffered himself with a shot .
lamb received a PhD in spring 2015 from the Delta State University . lamb received a PhD in such a university law on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ski : Lufthansa has set up the Group

on other things , in the Lufthansa , there will no longer be a management board for passenger transportation .
the ly@@ mph direction for the air@@ borne is to be so independent as soon as possible .
in the Executive Board of managing Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ rosci@@ ence in future .
with the launch , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlighted the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ski , with the Group will in order to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet .

Luke Hay@@ es by Manchester United could not play monthly n@@ inc@@ tures because of double cargo .
Luke Hay@@ ward suffered a double ro@@ inc@@ ture of his right b@@ one in the Champions League @-@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this is the left hand @-@ def@@ ending face , and for at least six months of playing the games , Louis van Ga@@ al can &apos;t get the hope that Shaw can play this season again .
the violation was caused by a clearing of h@@ √©@@ vi@@ ctor in the 15 minute after the 20 year old Shaw disclosed in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in 9 minutes on the field and needed necessary , before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double legs and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will join me or perhaps one day later , and then in Manchester .
it is a terrible , one boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then is fantastic , and then simply happens .
in the cabin , he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wine was cr@@ ushed .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have double Fra@@ ktur formed , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
I &apos;m happy with a red card and the im@@ position of a Elf@@ el@@ ometer .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rer Association , has not pun@@ ished the Max@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rer is mist@@ aken .
you can see for yourself , when I say that a Elf@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
web based on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; I cor@@ ds to you all your messages . I can &apos;t describe to you , as broken loose , my way to the recovery will start now , I get stronger back . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United @-@ suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Shaw , in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England @-@ Def@@ enders has added an additional incentive to recover until the end of June in the European Championships .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very small case . &quot;
if a player leaves this type of injury the place , all are very sad about this .
it is never the intention of our players to ob@@ ser@@ vere these opponents .
I suffered a leg quar@@ ry , as Mexico for Van Ga@@ al Holland &apos;s team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is quite hard , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponents , and if you hear that there is a very low case , it is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in another direction , so it looked out as if he had touched him , I had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
on the talk with SB@@ S6 : &apos; I know how it feels like it , I know how hard to be something that can be hard .
I feel very po@@ ked , so tired . I &apos;m sorry .

surely God knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax ?
there is a thing to learn all her parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost to the heart .
available , unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child @-@ care systems , his favourite child @-@ book has been asked to select the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult selection , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the super camp , and it &apos;s continued : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I would like to read my children , because it seems to have a picture or an message , which we didn &apos;t fit so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is simply describes the title of the book , instead , a table of output in the film version of 2012 , which added the new characters and details in order to expand the quite short original text @-@ text .
in the heart of the town of Th@@ or @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone , he hopes to see a genuine tree , &quot; now reads his wish to be a genuine tree , &quot; says , &quot; Don He@@ uss , whose real name was managed by Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , but he died in 1991 .
as if that was still suspected enough , the song of the Lor@@ ax movie that will be displayed on the web site that everything is artificial , but even the air is a commodity , but he hopes to win the world of au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y who wants to win his dreams . &quot;
though he certainly is to be a pra@@ gmati@@ cally to his father , it seems impro@@ v@@ ingly familiar with that when the local environment is going to fail . despite the protests in the Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck @-@ like being &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated it .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task is to read a hel@@ per , who has not read the subject of a child from the Lor@@ ax for 20 times .
probably , a Dow@@ ning @-@ Street nar@@ rate said that the text may probably come from cam@@ er@@ ons ever office .
Super@@ campus , who was confirmed that the text by cam@@ er@@ ons has been delivered , but there was no other immediate reviews .
Adam Ly@@ th was obviously threatened by law@@ suit from the UK , but there is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates on Pakistan , a difficult task , but if you have chosen the K@@ ader , the England for the tour , an recovery of the 3 @-@ 0 test drive was not on my map .
I would not trigger any backward victory .
A@@ last@@ air Coo@@ ke site may be less than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ lefield @-@ array , and the spirit values are powerful ; they are no sc@@ ars from 2012 only a youth positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ ve Ali was developed as a spin @-@ anch@@ or@@ man and adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even when he is an unknown ground on the test level , is an option for the attack .
to follow @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th qu@@ it from the United Kingdom @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th out of course , is difficult for me as his home trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in its seven tests , there have been two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that believe in the moment they are aligned .
there were no question@@ ing of Joe R@@ oot , for instance , and that led to the nom@@ ination , then - and I have said this , players have their own best hat@@ ches .
before a long time , we have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had no control over his own fate .
if he ki@@ cks off all other cases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his position , even though he did not so good achievements , and does not go surprised myself , he is a man @-@ man .
the question , how much time is a test stroke , is to place his character , is difficult .
Ly@@ th contracted for seven opportunities - how Sam Rob@@ son received him - after Nick Comp@@ ton nine received .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and backward .
the only privil@@ ege to be able to raise , was that England was first raised in the Caribbean in the Caribbean , but the un@@ lost money was now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is now past , and he is a stroke you drive yet .
he is a X @-@ factor of the cket@@ player which we first saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire place early in the season , when he achieved 2@@ 36 out of us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , something we met .
he must get at least the same opportunities as the one received before him , but on all , of course , it depends on the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of taking the Mo@@ een in addition to Cook , which bring their own with spin @-@ off Bow@@ ler and four qui@@ cks will be sh@@ aving , and I haven &apos;t got anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke right is not able to do and this left @-@ h@@ anders have already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket Player .
Mo@@ een probably won his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire doesn &apos;t work by any thing , but he doesn &apos;t have a number 3 for them ; and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 testing at the first Drop before he resigned in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he did three hundred men immediately , and I don &apos;t look back .
north@@ ward Ans@@ ar is looking back in the K@@ ader as Back @-@ up , and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on - an average of 31 with the bats and 35 of the ball - and think there is a P@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , who will get their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn on this tour .
apart from the team , England submitted a few sub@@ til ad@@ ditions to the Train@@ Plan .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , served as a consultant for the test phase .
it is one of the game &apos;s finest co@@ le which will bring an abundance of experiences , since it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ t@@ wood is designed for the white ball stage of the tour , and brings energy and powerful use in the set @-@ up .
I felt like feeling he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela has one insight , of which we can profit .
sometimes , new voices can in the she@@ er cabin of fresh winds , even if the messages are in line with the previously perform@@ ace .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes and is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my work .
some are not agree to agree , but coaches and team leadership do not agree on schedule .
and you need to remember that as in the players , their jobs are caused by the results .
such decisions are not easy @-@ hit .
the Bre@@ x@@ ite @-@ camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Aus@@ l Britain came out of the EU ) might be able to win the economy by 2017 , when the economy would start in 2017 in a window .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ unveiled a new hand @-@ drawn strategy to keep the United Kingdom in the EU and quickly became visible with each day without the choice of brilliant Jer@@ emy &quot; Is that Yes and the No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n of the Labor Party and the TU@@ C compl@@ ained unknown to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , added to the fact that some member states , as the EU is not stri@@ ped out in various crises , such as the EU and created agenda along with its own debt , as well as the agenda with inter@@ rupt changes and inter@@ tra@@ cting changes , which they are mostly likely to have them .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not even be dangerous to the social protection .
we could name Dave and Georges Be@@ f@@ ie @-@ agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance climb on the summit or bilateral relations in foreign capit@@ als , make a picture taken in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and tell that they were able to gain allies .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who once stood still in the outside of the EU ? , &quot; L@@ ass stand not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see how much and more short staff and officials had come from some major cities up to the point , where there is no matter whether we stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a exile , but she has been left in power for the past ten years before it looks so bad to put it in the ag@@ ger@@ ated woman such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande can rely on his re@@ election or his replacement by 2017 .
he is also a transparent strength .
Poland has probably been a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain for left .
it &apos;s difficult to imagine that they are moving to a conflict to help get rid of the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , by then it should leave the way from the UK , just what they don &apos;t want to do so , as most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies were .
hence , some such ministers even believes strongly that comments , but in SN@@ P @-@ style , as the Great Britain campaign in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ ite process , but my friend .
the new hearing was a Ple@@ ite , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of its value . &quot;
the Europeans know how to leave the Fle@@ et Street on their cost , and what the EU sc@@ ep@@ tics visited the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press as she was not supported by Tony Ben@@ n during the year 1973 when he supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
she is weak in Boris Johnson describing the Er@@ z @-@ euro support , who made a name for a &quot; EU @-@ ban@@ ana &apos;s &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
during all of his good@@ ness , the Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this collection belonged to the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ ing @-@ sh@@ ur@@ king , telephone @-@ ham@@ pers , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ come which have most of our great papers .
actually , Tony Bla@@ ir similar to her , but realized that when you sit with an hot Gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , he distributed to di@@ pped him to di@@ stract you , rather than to its lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band served more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir themselves , when he prevented the principle of reference to the constitution of Bla@@ ir , the EU approved constitution to be denied by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 which led to it a back door .
the press has never to draw him .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ re@@ n came to me in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he does not have time to spend more time for me - seems right in danger of repeat his general Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch . , that it seems to repeat an error at that time and today .
it may take but he must have a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to develop the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , who has abandoned BBC Radio on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe - I guarantee there many times - in development .
he says that in an re@@ formed EU , we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of the ki@@ dding traditional Sard@@ ar ye movement and the wild of Tor@@ ys Small @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say most of them in favour .
it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; no ra@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV played this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outing goes to him was due to that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of the prov@@ okes the Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow rapporteur .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s years old , to his old father himself painted in television , faithful to his Labour radio program , to go to and lose his cabinet manager .
Hil@@ er@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight in order to &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression was not this what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said that J@@ C had his co @-@ dom@@ ites and Ps in all reports on their cl@@ auses release on Monday night .
whatever you want to communicate with bottom @-@ up image from Cor@@ by@@ n , remember that he has even reached me in the age of TV around the clock , and in front of them into the Stru@@ c@@ ality of social media , a breeding home of Par@@ an@@ oia and betra@@ yal .
reason is real , Cameron don &apos;t give a free ticket to Europe who allow to be a stand@@ ably support in the speakers campaign for a self @-@ evident case , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell &apos;@@ it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins are sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s are basic am@@ big@@ uous for the EU membership , in keeping with their anti @-@ capitalist policies - not only a question of es@@ ot@@ out discussion among the left &apos;s dissi@@ dents declared a central principle of do@@ gmati@@ cs .
as with it &apos;s am@@ big@@ uous as its am@@ big@@ uous as the Nato @-@ Tom Wat@@ son thought , that J@@ C is getting a campaign to leave it - foreign diplom@@ ats are obliged to keep a sense in everything a sense for their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin have sent out political capital , they also have looked at @-@ di@@ str@@ ated vot@@ ers - to make significant conc@@ essions to the British if all of them can be point@@ less ?

experts have critici@@ ze the report of Public Health UK via E @-@ cigarettes
alle@@ g@@ ations in a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking , made up of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco consumer , said researchers .
experts who have written in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et began to claim the report by public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; in the past month , and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have established the resi@@ li@@ ence of the data and the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry have increased .
a editorial catalog in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &apos; extremely tiny basis &apos; on the PH@@ E &apos;s most important conclusion to be drawn .
two further scientists write to BM@@ J and asked whether the alle@@ g@@ ations are &quot; in stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of the European O@@ eff@@ ent@@ arian Health at the London School of hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ demi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundament@@ ally principle of public health is that strategies are based on the evidence of the efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public opinion p@@ adding is that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are just 95 % less harmful , as smoking &quot; in a detailed review of the preparation and modelling .
in fact , this statement is made up of a single session of 12 people called to study a model for a multiple @-@ point decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to study some opinions about the damage by the different ni@@ cot@@ ine products . the results of this meeting were inter@@ viewed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director received from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of bat cas@@ u@@ ts Health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants to the meeting referred to be done by an e @-@ cigarettes , but not the financing , which he reportedly stated in reports about the tobacco service , Philip Morris International to return to reports .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champions , of which some of them include some sectors in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco being moved from PH@@ E .
the research work of the group &quot; ge@@ ant stands that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most them in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however none of these links or restrictions regarding the PH@@ E report are discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well told that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the claims that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no proof of evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are so far as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of health and wellness in PH@@ E , said that on the alle@@ g@@ ations , the alle@@ g@@ ations had already been re@@ acted by the BM@@ J .
he said : &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are many less harmful as smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ smoking dies on his move .
all evidence suggests that health risks of E @-@ cigarettes are small , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects of study .
PH@@ E has the optimal duty of information on the public , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the point of evidence and , above all , when there is so much public spare parts about the relative risks in comparison to the tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people are dying due to a disease with respect to the smokers and in space costs the National Health System ( ¬£ 2 billion each year ) .
through the clear set of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without a risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by the smoke of the smoke , let us fulfil our national salvation .
BBC should give the East@@ on calendar , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should be remembered as well as the East@@ on and the Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would play the right hand &quot; for hit shows as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee will be used only to make the type of programs , which are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to publicly accept the publicly @-@ legal programs , which would probably be seen from a smaller public , as the most popular shows of their Riv@@ alen and digital expos@@ ures like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC GM , Tony Hall , said that the company wants to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs in charge or send us the clearly &quot; un@@ subsi@@ dised rival &quot; , &quot; said Johnson managed the senior communication committee on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio fee , which I think about it was medium or long @-@ term idea , you should at least do his production at least programs that could not make or put in order .
you will send The Voice in a first @-@ class window of time , because they want to achieve a great support for their future .
the idea that nobody else show this , is a jo@@ ke , there is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression rate will be financed , which could also be subsidi@@ zed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is a this program , East@@ th is another , strongly @-@ to @-@ scale both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels are fed to their right arm .
I try to see me , how to be public television broad@@ ly .
I don &apos;t believe that this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , a business@@ man on series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that &quot; the BBC guil@@ d &quot; on the hunt for those who work there , &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of men who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure the long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programs of the BBC will give back the former head of the Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ &apos;s gart at the Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC would be selling out as the East@@ on series .
Johnson stated that it rather can not measure the public , but they can not measure the public , but they argue , when they argue with some light missions to the jus@@ tification of 4 billion ¬£ their categories , &quot; Well ; of course , we have all that affected programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window of time , where no one will ever wanted to see .
to the radio station , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge to find a rather reg@@ att@@ acking system in terms of conditions which can obtain the best value of it .
for example , think of course , think that you should have a great value for ¬£ 150 each year here , but for people who wish for the 150 ¬£ a lot of money , ask me whether they &apos;ve not consume much time of the BBC .
the former sky@@ line and Channel 5 Head of David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC requested their ann@@ ot@@ on mission to be , to inform us about that , and keep it . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education , he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio . they have to inform themselves about public legal television stations in Australia and Canada .
by the question of partnerships said El@@ der , the BBC should do more in places like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV channels are shown , and produce the commercial channels such alli@@ ances in order to make everything online .
the Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; normal brain cells can be controlled by record @-@ wave
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ ga will change the direction to the moment in which it will be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred plants with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled from out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ ga change the direction of the moment in which they have with sound impul@@ ses that have to have high frequencies for the human ear to high frequencies , are also radi@@ ated .
the pulse is proce@@ eded by the power of the Mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to bear the membrane rup@@ tions that are re@@ manufactured using ultr@@ as@@ ound .
further about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used on ultr@@ as@@ ound bio@@ tics to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
together with Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , the Guardian that the proceedings of a day could replace the depths of brain death , inv@@ ests its electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ adding is normally not as@@ ound , but Chal@@ ab@@ ani showed that they were doing so when it were surrounded by a liquid of micro@@ scop@@ ic .
the bli@@ sters , found out , will strengthen the Ultr@@ asonic waves , which are penet@@ rating into the hearts of hearts .
the stronger scales of ultr@@ asonic waves are involved in the structures of TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and is found in the membran@@ es of some of the saus@@ ages .
the gra@@ waves are around the opening of these I@@ on channels and activate the cells which they relate to such a report &quot; Nature Communications .
in order to create ultr@@ as@@ ound @-@ valve C@@ ato@@ den , the wor@@ ms will be gene@@ tically due to their mot@@ one@@ ering on the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion .
when se@@ per@@ ed on the different creation , the gra@@ m@@ shafts were reinforced by the micro@@ b@@ lows and transferred to the hearts of hearts , where they changed the modified mot@@ one@@ ering .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with opto@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool for scientists , ne@@ ural ne@@ ons with stimul@@ us of light and switching off .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages compared to this technology .
in contrast to light , which have to be revealed in a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ ch@@ ound @-@ ultr@@ as@@ ound bio@@ tite component can be monitored regularly and can be sent to the brain on the front of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and therapeutic virus that is possible that the noticed human neur@@ ons is temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultr@@ as@@ ound equipment in a clinical approach to certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
on other applications , however , other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells .

many artists take up activists united through activists within the role of protest against the work and note that they may walk outside in the real world , so their art have a impact on society .

V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was sho@@ cked on the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons of arms - thanks to a demonstration of the Excel @-@ calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;
they played with the invention of a re@@ isti@@ ble th@@ aw@@ ing company , but &quot; with its silent color and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have a fantastic job that help us help awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Amnesty International .
what we need now is an timing of the British government and the guarantee that the weather conditions were not checked before our door .

eight golden rules for life in students dormit@@ ories
ten years ago I moved into a student dormit@@ ory , still in a student dormit@@ ory , still per@@ ched in spirit and moral re@@ vis@@ ing , but only now I remember the f@@ anci@@ ed smile that I denied - and to the numerous , long @-@ mu@@ ddy above others .
the most of what I learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the arrived in student dormit@@ ories ranges from slightly ner@@ ed @-@ open up to absolutely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is good to mar@@ ie : people tell you where you come from where you have said , Where you have said , &quot; You have said , &quot; Because Yahweh , guys , there is only a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same , start @-@ up questions and show what you are interested .
that is right di@@ stra@@ bly the conversation , and helps you to find out the people who like to come in contra@@ diction to those who would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were broken in fire and they would be fighting .
leave people .
the rooms of people converting them to drinks @-@ recipes , a film @-@ night event venues and public sick@@ ness , but are also the places where people are serving and under@@ wear their under@@ wear @-@ under@@ wear .
in this case , remember : do not remember the university with a relationship :
an greatest treatment at the University is giving a major treatment to the University .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ area @-@ blo@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and socially .
this can be the hell for someone , who tried to recover from recover .
nothing in the culture allow you to tell you : &quot; I may know you , and I want to keep up our friendship , but you must go out , so that I am back the energy when you use for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to thank you when a fellow recru@@ it is exhau@@ sted from soci@@ alizing it - and send it an SMS with an SMS .
speaking of purchase can do : do it .
a guy in my student halls had an idea that a no closed doors had an invitation .
he looked out some things .
friendship : close by baking .
since you begin the Uni at the cli@@ max of the Back Sling , when the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s are welcome to a plate ( 1950 @-@ 1950 ) welcome to the neighborhood , and I ask you a little while , and if I do not smile that I have a few personal questions .
home @-@ made treats are very good way to close friends .
their fellow occup@@ ants are working to participate , keep , and they will be their face with a delicious surprise at the end .
course you depends on whether you are a real b@@ aker .
bad smo@@ ked cl@@ um@@ ps from flour , sugar and fat make it that people are getting off when you are running .
food to steal , is a traditional crime in student dormit@@ ories .
of course , the cl@@ ash of chicken is ste@@ aling around , but is the drops of a drop of milk for your tea ?
always check the with the milk owner .
the odds of a good fact that they are saying to operate himself , even if they are inside the inside .
if someone tells your things out , it is anno@@ ying , and you have just got my comp@@ assion , but try to more balanced than my fellow @-@ worker , who added their milk to ins@@ ul@@ ant , to pun@@ ish the crown .
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise about the people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not only about to be a more experimental man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the word she leads to people who are sitting in Gl@@ ash@@ aus .
a girl on my corridor asked its neighbors , whether it some ex@@ its some sh@@ ear , bass &amp; bass over , because there was three in the morning , and she had an test in the morning .
they re@@ dedicated to his listen to music .
when finally , at 5 o &apos;clock , she set up her neighbours to sleeping another 2 hours before she had her own music to spend their own music , and had it to its three @-@ hour test .
if it were not romantic but if your future E@@ very partner would happen to come into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
vice vers@@ a but if you couldn &apos;t change any ward , if you &apos;re a co @-@ author for your future E@@ he@@ jiang , it will open up again and you may experience it , as they will experience their common friends ...
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co @-@ worker definitely did not say your future E@@ he@@ mi@@ in , try at least to speak for a little reason .
at the exciting moment , in which you will notice that someone believes his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between the Ul@@ an and M@@ ob@@ um@@ power@@ ing itself , when it seems .
a good shock is fun , but it takes some moments to be found up to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
even you have a precious and am@@ using lesson for security - but fail to you as a way of t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
do your door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but later you are not able to get their ownership at the blanket - not more than twice .
row houses for refugees , all @-@ stone , ger@@ man@@ ger
the real estate spa of Markus Gil@@ dner relies on a Central Park Valley for people who didn &apos;t have much money for people who have not spent much money .
so , for refugees , for now : &quot; not only refugees need to feed the refugees , but also the only de@@ compensation of the mother and the Ger@@ ling @-@ deser@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am how even better now and build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands refugees are imposing on the flat market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner - who can decide to know how much cheaper rooms can be opened : it builds a project houses for refugees for refugees in a project .
Mr Arnold Reisen , many refugees become home to the residential market .
what solution you will offer you ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the Swiss luxury accommodation in containers or gym has no sustainability .
because people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee @-@ time , we need sufficient living in the next few decades .
one of ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey terraced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner - a town@@ house needs at least place .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if there are even people in li@@ blocks .
each of the six homes that are located just on the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four applic@@ ants .
each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be , however , that many refugees shall be say , there is peace and I go back .
then , the houses can easily be converted to their respective requirements .
how much is the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space is up to 184 000 euros , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasts six months .
this is reasonable .
provisions governing the planning of their plans ?
shipping : this agree , I have moved my project correctly .
it makes a very complicated , the dro@@ pping gl@@ es@@ sm@@ ite special construction and the parking fee .
cut the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
there is still under@@ signed , who creating three apartments in one row houses , needs at least three sites .
only in the cities is missing .
and refugees and asylum have no cars .
how have the residents of the terraced house project responded ?
Gil@@ dner : there was who accused of having arriving to build a luxury building for asylum seek@@ ers .
definitely not true .
but tigh@@ tened , you do not have the new competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : come true : we had over the construction boom in Germany over the last five years but they were built @-@ in luxury apartments that hardly can make any more .
my project also received the message , which is very necessary for normal people . &quot;
not only refugees , but also the only pull @-@ out mother or the Ger@@ ling @-@ deser@@ ve .
I will show how to get comfortable and well @-@ build today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how you get the new iPhone operating system , you will update your Apple update
the new operating system can be requested by doing the setting @-@ app , go for &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
when it is ready , you can download and install the phone option for download and install it .
some are when you started running on problems , as it was granted an error message , healing that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users is recommended to wait to wait or wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght or try to update over iTunes .
the phone itself is via the rest of the process .
this can be enough to set the cancellation of Apps in order to create position - but in fact , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to rep@@ airing your apps and then to re@@ install them as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is loaded on the upgrade or stored in the proximity of a charging station , allowing the battery is charged .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not use that the update is being continued when the phone might be shut down on a half way and this could lead to a crash of the updates .

Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees through &quot;
but after border controls , the border controls are also be sp@@ un at our southern border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said .
studies to the Hungarian border remain in parallel with this .
as soon as he is clear that everyone who had a demand for asylum , but also could make &quot; course &quot; . &quot;
the power supply and safety of the people arise in the fore@@ ground .
clearly , however , it is clear that &quot; these signals needed , &quot; the Council of Ministers &quot; said .
people don &apos;t know that , but not from the Austro @-@ Slovenian border , we do not accept the so @-@ called migration flows .
it takes a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia .
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s organis@@ er for the coming refugees in direction of Austria and Germany can make cycle of cor@@ rid@@ ors to refugees for refugees .
quite so , this Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy√∂r@@ gy at Z@@ ni@@ dar in Ljubljana did not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors are &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia turns on the monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary .
Croatia is already controlled by Croatia for the outside of the Schengen area , on the other hand .
like the Council of Ministers , Slovenia wants to get its limits for refugees but is not compatible .
&quot; each EU member has to fill his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; says Gy√∂r@@ gy Z@@ ni@@ dar .
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday , in eastern Croatian at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d for the registration to avoid the registration .
Croatian police was able to attack them in the near corn fields .
following local media , ever since , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , a company with new refugees meet .
it was in the war predominantly of the Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children .
the armed services and the red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , be a country with around 4,000 refugees , the Minister of Interior Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
the ship would also be taken from Pre@@ se@@ vo in the Maz@@ ed@@ onian capital border with so far as refugees had brought to the Hungarian border with Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade are , however , that it is possible to propose some people certain routes : &quot; neither we can do , nor let us do it , &quot; was it .
however , according to media reports , in the spring the first bus of around 50 refugees meet in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , on the course of the day , another buses were expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were all over the night and had traveled throughout the night by some 500 kilometres distant destinations of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary had done , so the police have said that we will go there , &quot; said a man of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany in Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could be said to be agreed to ob@@ lige the previous Balkan @-@ route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a little further west of the route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic also emphasized that his country was preparing for the fall of a strong induc@@ ing of refugees as well prepared for possible expression .
details : he did not , he pointed out that Croatia was as a non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; comprehensive options to the border control . &quot;
take a close controls to qualify for the membership in the en@@ gen@@ ist@@ room .
Slovenia has gone one since 2007 to continue the country since 2007 , consistently raised a good certificate of compliance with the standard of border controls .
in this page , only 300 refugees suff@@ ers from the Hungarian border .
according to Belgrade , they would have brought the past night to the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go to the Croatian border , is un@@ clear .
the Minister of the Interior of Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic also sought to worry about a court in Hor@@ gos , and to calm the debate on the alternative route of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be enough to act a very high number of refugees .
it is not to say if they would not continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per for migrants - dangerous - alternative route
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute the refugees , on which the alternative routes through Croatia have been awarded .
however , border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not completely harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war nor even the min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police was known that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .

Fed@@ ex ex @-@ results mixed , financial compensation for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ sum@@ mar@@ ised dis@@ appoint@@ ing results for the last quarter , and the Li@@ efer free@@ wheel lowered the profit of winning on a full year because of demand , freight and higher costs in its maintenance service .
the company also said that she plans to plan approximately 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for this holiday .
at this time in the past year , Fed@@ em@@ announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ ex Vest@@ as said to earn a gain between $ 40 and $ 10.00 in the fiscal year earn , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the smaller relative , despite the price increases , which are on average 4.9 percent and on 4 January 2008 , and despite higher rate of attacks , heavy and large packages , will be collected in November .
the company said that it has always been granted the result of the previous year due to cost reductions , higher income , and due to its growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; solid yields came &quot; after bringing the company to we@@ aker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and with truly global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those announced in the Riv@@ alen U@@ PS , comprising 9@@ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , roughly the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on August 31 , 2012 , Fed@@ ex 6@@ 92 million lost $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , nearly behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , and asked analysts forecast .
turnover climbed by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks simply asked analysts of expected -@@ 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ ot@@ Ex caused a decline in recent years as a result in the international priorities of orders that received sales in its unit Express shipping for its operations .
but the boom in the online shopping bag completed the results of Fed@@ at Ground Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of domestic transfer is 29 percent , but the operating result was basically due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit has higher income due to higher prices , whereas the result was significantly lower in freight store .
in the market of market , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed E@@ Ex dis@@ covers around ‚Ç¨ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .

on the most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days a week by a 27 @-@ foot of Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni table , to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the mark for the first time since almost a decade .
dro@@ pping by them at an end of the reduced , two @-@ storey seats than is located in the United States .
the map is a Memory that F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Cher@@ ries and her colleagues would have to put on the economic interests of all other things .
the Central Bank has a double @-@ fold order from the congress : maxim@@ ise of the US @-@ Employment and prices are st@@ ably stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that it will be a third @-@ cash position : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is starting to be pre@@ f@@ ron@@ ed by an unprecedented level of short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is maintained , the most recent moves to strengthen the global financial markets of the global financial markets , this vol@@ atility in the global financial markets .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important to what you are in , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief leader in the Mak@@ ler@@ c Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
but I think when looking for a pre@@ text the interest rate is not to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty about the global market enough to push through the global market , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing , which guarantees to itself the finance market itself .
about half of the economi@@ sts , who were recently asked about Bloomberg , have given a interest rate earlier this week .
the financial markets are permitted , however , the financial markets are waiting , with a key indi@@ ator that will only show a 30 % chance to increase its income .
this indicates a decline in securities markets , if the rate increases the rate increases , by raising the strategy to blow out the impact , by their promise to far away in the fact that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average value of 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ politics communic@@ ates the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econ@@ omist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Service Group .
it would be a surprise that the F@@ ed would increase the sets at that time , &quot; he said .
if that &apos;s what it does , &quot; have to go very far into a statement in order to calm the financial markets , so that she does not test into panic . &quot;
other experts argue that a interest rate would cost the financial markets , because they would be un@@ certainty about when the F@@ ed would take him .
prior to a month , F@@ ed in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in slow development of the mon@@ eti@@ er conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had already been in spring and early summer , that in spite of the condition of Liber@@ als , Minister of economic progress would be required , an increase of the constitution .
while creation of jobs at this year , the improvement in the job market was solid in this year &apos;s solid job .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and , near the levels that saw the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
they had already shown a recovery .
even though inflation remained below the year below 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed combat representatives , saying that the principal reason will be the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can tackle interest rates and do them need a spin on the job market , &quot; said Ian Mel@@ ep@@ ch@@ dson , the econ@@ omist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets were coming together all over the world at the end of the month , following China had its currency down .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % compared to its maximum level of investors than investors , thought that a decline in Chinese economy would decrease the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow now has a 10 % discount on the stock market .
for the F@@ ed @-@ representatives may affect the market turbul@@ ent , when you should increase the interest .
when the events would not appear over the financial markets and the messages of the Chinese economy among the past couple of weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fellow at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former employees of the U.S. state bank .
now , he says that she would go at least one month , to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot un@@ certainty about what the impacts on the US economy is , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
none of the health of the global economy is none of the chief , therefore , they should not be involved in the decision @-@ term , however .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authorities have become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enorm@@ ously high in the past few years .
the blo@@ t note of that &apos;s successor , Ben S. Bern@@ ese in 2013 , however , that the F@@ ed has produced their mon@@ eti@@ ere expansion &quot; through a tight part of the globe .
in a world , through the markets and economies , the F@@ ed @-@ House can also be communic@@ ated by the F@@ ed @-@ representatives , but they are not only advised to other central banks and experts in order to provide a better understanding for global economy .
her term financial success is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ou@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , chief of the global strategy for the company En@@ vest@@ ing Inc .
Jeffrey S@@ ed , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month , &quot; F@@ ed had a history of Trans@@ actions on financial market movements that can &apos;t be linked with the economic fundament@@ alist data . &quot;
lacqu@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which promotes an interest rate , commit decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought to the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tivity in the U.S. by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limited noticeable effects on growth in the U.S. , &quot; said .
a year later , the F@@ ed @-@ representatives disc@@ arded these cuts .
F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability within a severe crisis , whereas , in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the committee on interest at the Bank of England .
the latest tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she will surely get in to the situation , in which they fear of a interest age , &quot; said the markets that thri@@ lling , &quot; said Poznan , President of the Peter@@ sons Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act also contains the double Mand@@ ate and does not contain the financial stability , and until this is not modified , I don &apos;t believe that it is the time .

refugees need accommodation : the study is warning of the estate
the location in the german complex market is balanced .
also more refugees seek for a affordable stay .
the pressure on the residential market is growing .
the social residential property is about a challenge .
the waiting experiences in the German residential market has long begun .
with the coming refugees and working people from the EU , more people suffer on a market that is already over@@ loaded in many great cities .
you can compete with a low @-@ income statement in the final paid apartments .
in order to cover the requirements for affordable apartments , would have to be built up to 2020 each year before 400@@ ,000 new units .
this result is a study on behalf of the EU &apos;s symposium &quot; social residential construction . &quot;
by comparison , in Germany , 260@@ ,000 units are done in Germany .
so , over 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live on asylum seek@@ ers in a first public accommodation .
many hotels then encounter the flat market and rows almost one in the long distance from the apartments .
according to Statisti@@ cians of the Swiss Federal Office , the last year , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers are available .
the negative development of the residential market is not just in the rise of refugees .
the study makes significant changes in the housing policies of the last years .
Germany seemed to be an expected deficit of 2015 , which will be bigger by the year .
up in present , about 77@@ ,000 of living units are already compl@@ ains of this study , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
so many years stayed in large cities with not@@ ted connections in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed there because of the fl@@ au@@ te to the housing market in@@ sured longer in &quot; hotel Mama . &quot;
in the capit@@ als , the number of square meters per capita has fallen back to the last few years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social construction work &quot; has a re@@ boot .
that &apos;s new incentive to boost the social construction of the typ@@ ing .
this could be reduced to the Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ - tax , and the basic tax for subsi@@ dised flats are st@@ unted .
there will also be necessary to undertake this tax @-@ off amor@@ tis@@ ation measures .
the National Bank for Refu@@ ge@@ es the State Bank Kf@@ W for children , cities and communities are just doing well .
a good week after the start was on Monday evening , at 184 million euros , more than half of the euro available have been retri@@ eved by around 300 million euros .
now the project could be sc@@ aled @-@ up .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia into corridor .
according to Hungary , there is virtually no longer any more , since then more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb abandoned its passing through Slovenia in North without a hur@@ dle .
this is dangerous , however , is dangerous .
Croatia is planning with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors to refugees for refugees .
&quot; I was speaking with Slovenian Minister of State , and if it is necessary to organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Affairs Rank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is still a Schengen area .
after the block@@ age of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees meet to Croatia , to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in the Croatian world of cinema .
Hungary had sealed its border to the refugees at the end of day .
new laws , that come into force on the same day in power , do a deal contract in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Minister , Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic , explained : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are here , they are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
people were , however , people who would not live in Croatia .
the Croatian police triggered the first refugees to be out in the border of Serbia on the border of Croatia &apos;s neighbouring countries .
according to most visited media reports , in Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they arrived in front of the bus and tax@@ is against the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival , she attempts to get to walk on the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ based borders , the refugees forced not to Gren@@ zz@@ √§@@ une .
for this , the border strip of other dangers involved . there is even sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v Civil War in the 1990s .
mine clearance is to make a safe part of this passage .
soon to Hungary , right after the closing of the border any more refugees .
on Tuesday the police reached 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the party on Monday it was even 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws , the over@@ sh@@ ing@@ cal and damage to the Gren@@ zz@@ is being considered to be the im@@ position .

his sentence handed down to five years and the deportation out of the country from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , you took place on Tuesday in the newly @-@ called &quot; Tran@@ sition &quot; border with 94 asylum candidate , almost all of which - 93 - the main transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the tra@@ mp up to 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees .
in fact , no one has no view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
after the Hungarian view , Serbia &apos;s a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the predicted asylum seek@@ ers should be stopped there .
prior to the &quot; tran@@ sit@@ one &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees presently still gathered .
in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke for workers to clear workers .
they gathered up the gar@@ bage collection , leaving the tens of thousands of people left over the road following the road@@ side in recent weeks .
fire safety have been broken down and converted into a cross @-@ camp in the Grenz@@ ort .
the no one wanted to let this upgrade .
Austria achieve only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
also , the country has reinforced its border controls .
by about 20.000 migrants , however , in the country still held .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the German authorities after the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , a smaller groups of refugees meet at foot .
mayor of ... &quot; en@@ force &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were after the bridge close to the park , in which ten people are standing by travel agents at the entrance of the tent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to begin with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had stopped on Sunday due to the refugee &apos;s journey to Austria , it was called in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars along the border near the near Pass@@ au .
previously , we only have discovered some of the unforgettable guests again , with J@@ ause and beverages .
we have immediately told , we bring it with the car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was of course , &quot; says the city of O@@ √ñ@@ N . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man left , it didn &apos;t take a big donation to over - 100 euros for the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
charter passengers arriving at a regional train change in Wels , on Sunday evening , at a regional train to Pass@@ au , in order to enable the ex@@ cl@@ amation that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but there were still beyond the border .
the regional train was completed , but before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border generally highly concentrated in the course .
the Br√º@@ cken@@ berg association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was locked ; in before , a two @-@ stroke sport group organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria @-@ Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n should now send another Z@@ ig@@ ar by us , is a logical conclusion of a light policy :
instead of bre@@ eder R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke for immediate structures to help the establishment of structures , the Federal Chancellor have officially put up the military and public to the power of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis in Lower Saxony .
the bodies of these politics are not only the Austrian who now faces in legal areas with chao@@ tic circumstances .
also the flo@@ ods that have to be believed that the &quot; praise land &quot; which had been invited to welcome and welcome nothing as another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge in view to the continued refugee and the ongoing winter , with us decent conditions for protection .
and it will be able to maintain a bigger building - peace , safety and stability of Austria .
Konrad on the search of 34@@ ,000 winter conditions
Konrad has started to do all hands with the refugee camp .
Christian Konrad is known that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank &quot; in order to depic@@ ts Qu@@ arti@@ s for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen already has the release in the handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday came to be without great host , &quot; Konrad and praised the organization of the organization . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , the Interior spoke on the situation of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ al situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad moves relating to a demand of 85@@ ,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in this year .
to meet the number of points , 3@@ 5.000 inter@@ places must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 is expected to present the limit of 15,000 people .
if more refugees will allow you to create it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without bottom , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already led conversations with the provincial capit@@ als .
these have now allowed him to help themselves for the coming years Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar had to be supported .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , intended to be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
there is great expectations for asylum , as well as the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ ping like we . &quot;
private individuals can offer very complicated accommodations on the platform .
in addition , we will invest in hotels , who are still empty in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in Not@@ ep@@ tics , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ender have to be certain outside the towel warmer or size of the upper thor@@ ns .
for a short time , the not@@ ation needs need to be &quot; Not@@ ting standards . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is the first successful employment of the Interior , to make his experience at the same time .
I am an older Lord , which man does not say without any to the face to the tru@@ st@@ ness .
excessive output is the most important body .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause a republic no cost , as they declared even today .
from the number of employees they want to increase it to three to four .
the own qu@@ arti@@ er@@ search was not successful yet .
Konrad , wanted to establish a container at the St. Steph@@ an@@ an office .
nonetheless , there seems problems with the permission .
Linz requ@@ esting a better distribution

this is currently not necessary as we could cause those affected by taking these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emergency case , however , further locations are to be tested on their disposal .
criticism of the urban centres at the inscription of the refugees within the country .
also other districts must make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed . &quot;
in an extended telephone company with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ oll ( VP ) has closed further action in the refugee &apos;s par@@ qu@@ ery on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has asser@@ ted me that the German borders must not be sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
but , it is now the appropriate border checks .
there were any more persons in refugees from refugees to Germany .
however , the protection sens@@ ing would be brought with regular bre@@ wing in Germany .
according to the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger demanded more intense solidarity in the refugee &apos;s army .
that Austria is now turn once again to the borders on controls , for the T@@ oll in a logical consequence , &quot; of the action of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the general refur@@ bis@@ ment of the &quot; New yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial banner is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production centres , the listed IT Group S &amp; T listed companies , the remainder ( 2700 square metres ) is expected to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
in IT , the smart heads are at our raw material - and we need to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could also present to invest in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ pyard and later to re@@ launch them .
already from the beginning S &amp; T , with the new neighbours , the number of them is really big : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic concept is just a matter of time . &quot;
the total of 1.7 million euros was invested in the production , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center that belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Federal Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is being le@@ ased from the Linz AG for 60 years with S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .

since yesterday , the new shop has been in operation .
earlier , several weeks was rebuilt .
&quot; I have long before this , that I will still open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive factors for this decision was , among others , that was the fur@@ ter producer who work in Bologna , from the idea of a location , at which just their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only in the big region of Linz , sold this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
your fashion @-@ interest has hit the cra@@ dle of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I do not change most , if something was developed and I could show new trends in different words .
why . as many woman carrying a beautiful hand@@ bag in the top of a hand@@ bag , even the specialists can &apos;t get to the old security .
perhaps it is in that there is a beautiful bag every fit .
the fr@@ ing@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ plan@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ √§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place where the inhabitants can be named .
this feature is ra@@ cher , too , with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to capture the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he was like a foreign country , journalists Ru@@ ins , or knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office - sp@@ un up the elect@@ oral struggle .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the former K@@ all@@ stadt under the el@@ dest capital , where the parents of the real property does not come .
the New York apartment offers long @-@ term operation is many in the win@@ ch village on the wine road .
maneu@@ ver in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants town is related to about flat @-@ y edges of it &apos;s related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump is scheduled in competition in the election .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ t Simone Wen@@ del produced a film about Tr@@ ump .
what think the village inhabitants shall fall on his target to become the most powerful men of the world ?
&quot; I think that is exciting , but there is something exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stadt @-@ Art , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ t has passed an am@@ using documentary on the site and his famous spring@@ time , along with Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , known as the cause of death , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he is also successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
by the king of the heart , he has not brought it there .
although it may be the respect of the power of the family , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit a great support , &quot; says he says .
nevertheless , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt , have within a radius of &quot; The Br@@ ect@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ plan@@ ers &quot; - to high @-@ end language : the worker , &quot; she says .
Tr@@ unk also comes from the village of An@@ sel@@ ector .
the story of the story began far back in 1885 when the later grandfather im@@ migr@@ ated and opened a local area for gold dig@@ ging in the United States .
the foundation of the real estate Group in New York were the first piece of work in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of aging : her desire to return to home in his home , failed to return in the Bavarian state which belonged to the Palat@@ inate .
he never have written Tr@@ ump , as he was once approved without permission , the director of the Institute for Pf@@ al@@ z@@ an &apos;s history and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , explains the film .
Tr@@ ump was written by the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal migration . &quot;
this is contrast with the co @-@ covered testimon@@ ies of the descendants .
this had repeatedly den@@ unci@@ ation about Mexican immigrants in the USA and requested the construction of a border wall to un@@ aud@@ its illegal immigration .
&quot; as was pol@@ ish , the author was not so pleasant , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a child rock , the Op@@ a was born . Heinz &quot; ) .
the hat@@ ches on the ring is more dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so br@@ ushed forward . &quot;
do you believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
that I don &apos;t imagine anything , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never ed about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension version Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sh@@ ra@@ mm mentions the man@@ ten@@ stad@@ ter which came with a visit to the Church of Heinz during a visit to the church Hall , which is generally well cont@@ ended .
&quot; that can I not imagine anything of Donald &apos;s Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
you would like to do it better when he don &apos;t want the election , because &quot; one has a radical perc@@ enti@@ sts , I don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s good . &quot;
when those who had finished their grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the United States , would have been , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics as they &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ an@@ ath Sarah Bu@@ eh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ del &apos;s film , which was inter@@ viewed for a short story , have seen 12 000 movie stores , also in the USA raise the interest .
the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher @-@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park was named for gentle tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eering . &quot;
in the neighbor@@ land of the country , the alpine region is responsible for the release of the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ eering school &quot; may have 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area has to be demonstrated as protected area .

Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son returned to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of the leader of the liberal , but it has no great shifts on the Today &apos;s staff .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the Federal capital to be a Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , returns to London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of it seemed to play for Australian TV viewers who could not play an important role as sunrise on average 39@@ 7,000 spectators in the five major cities , in contrast to USA 33@@ ,000 .
Today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and final Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today , USA closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August , Today , USA reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 Euro Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 .
so in September , sunrise employs some 34@@ ,000 spectators at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at USA .
this is the most interesting what had happened in every morning .
the winds of the wall would like this morning to the morning !
Karl and Lisa are right in order , thanks for the review !

the result of last night was answered with a clear &quot; yes &quot; .
the X @-@ factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million people and gained a bit of the block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .

on Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour of a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot plu@@ gin on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the first night of the second evening of The Chase Australia will certainly match to match the hot sea , which will be staged at 17 : 30 .

the last three voices are clear : Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect man - but if he chose to choose ?
secrets has revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ an@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are possibly responsible for acci@@ dentally obtained The Bachelor wins .
the woman , at which Sam Wood lost in The bach@@ el@@ or , was bapti@@ zed in largest secret services .
and no of the three left remaining girl is certainly not cheap , whether they that the one who received the last rose .
but when we came with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ an@@ ons Fel@@ lows on day , before you checked , you may be mistak@@ enly deleted , you may be given the victory .
Sam Wood uses his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have left to ly@@ rical way , why Wood &apos;s out the perfect man and so named his sense for hum@@ our , hon@@ ors , family values and positive attitude , reasons why they want to be able to travel his partner &apos;s partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get the ultimate rose , &quot; you might go to the toys , which the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s lives .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki du@@ bbed third - but with itself - Mack@@ ay as best partner in the Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; following the moment when I walked into the house and ( Sar@@ nia ) and Sam@@ s energies , I noticed that they were quite connected ; and I thought that during the entire show of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows told me .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with its own feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes , that they and Sam Wood were together as a pair .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his N@@ FL failed .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest to his move into the US and there were many other teams who sent over an impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach have discovered Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank , so he only had a feeling on the way , such as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ Liga We@@ ap@@ t on Tuesday with his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday with 20 @-@ 3 victory .

Tom@@ n@@ ula showed his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies , over the rest of the teams from the mill was gr@@ ind , he encouraged her .
in his press conference , Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne during his press conference after the game .
the 49 &apos;s sport re@@ porter @-@ In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne is also encouraged by the Special Advisor to the Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who told him to forget his for@@ got sc@@ ars and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t was restored with a P@@ unt , who was restored in the first stages of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings .
it &apos;s surely not the start to see the Hay@@ ne and its powerful Australian ge@@ ons , who had expected to see his N@@ FL in his debut .
Hay@@ ne leave the turn of the player and spoke at the Australian Radio Duo &quot; Ham@@ mond &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not be a wor@@ sen@@ ing into his N@@ FL in his N@@ FL .
&quot; that was a thing which is now found only to take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne is identical to the section with its original in 2007 when a pass conducted a T@@ ry in Queensland , in his own in @-@ go@@ al region .
it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

for easy @-@ important diabetic patients can be helpful in loss @-@ loss surgery .
the benefits of low @-@ loss surgery with type 2 diabetes can last up to a new study at least five years after a new study .
it is even too early to say whether easily over@@ sized people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the level data required for a long time to show , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss effect , wrote an editorial difference from the new study in J@@ AMA Sur@@ gery .
weight loss loss or adi@@ posit@@ as @-@ surgery , use different methods to minimi@@ ze the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body @-@ their ability to record food .
the development of O@@ bes@@ ity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been efficient , but most of the studies have been carried out at humans , the disease , or obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain size of weight in terms of weight , is generally regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered for obes@@ e .
you can have your BMI before : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have been collected in the study since 2007 and bring it about two kinds of obesity - magne@@ b@@ ypass and stomach cra@@ cking - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were very overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent surgery is exposed , declined from 31 to 24@@ ,5 x the end of the 5th year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of the person also remained with less , the non @-@ surgical type of diabetes was approximately equal to 29 .
below those who are subjected to a surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes disease was totally stable and 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group the patients were dissolved only in a 1 percent and sometimes in only about two percent .
furthermore , results were measured in the controls of the blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL @-@ cholesterol &quot; in general even better in the &quot; surgical group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers were viol@@ ating the male blood levels of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , who reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is thought to have been among 7 per cent , write the researchers .
according to the operation , the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
yet it remained stable with around 8 percent in the medical therapy group .
but these better &quot; gly@@ ce@@ mic control &quot; - such as you achieved in an improved H@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - have no loss of death in five years , according to guide Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also did the average results in the 2 types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger vessels in the BMI ( 7.@@ 4 % vs. 2.@@ 2.1 % ) and posted a full length of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) , respectively .
while the new study is not to show a survival benefit of surgery in five years , there are indications from one study of heavy people in Sweden , that operation does not say , &quot; Black@@ stone , &quot; said Black@@ stone , &quot; at the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was under@@ go by obes@@ e people who underwent an adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , approximately 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that conven@@ tionally eli@@ zed methods .
although the new study doesn &apos;t have the benefit of survival in surgery in surgery , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s a cal@@ ming area for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the proceedings .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is low in the lower BMI of BMI , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone also added that humans and their doctors should start getting serious , as soon as the patient with his BMI between 27 and 30 is higher .
&quot; I think we will wait for a long time , until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that as soon as these genetic modification has accumulated , they have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes that is very hard to do . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible to everybody to Europe can come &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
in Europe , not all refugees could not hold all refugees , the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East can fly in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to end the violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the refugee crisis with the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom to his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ any@@ at Oxford , which is on a photographic studies .
he demanded that in the respective circumstances , he requested the interests of crimes against the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of West European countries had been ad@@ sor@@ b by the refugee crisis , but the situation should not be appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible to be coming to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s Dalai Lama and recru@@ iting the crisis , he emphasized that there was only a temporary solution .
&quot; several thousand Syrian refugees meet to take care of , but in the meantime you have to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , is said .
finally , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on the terrorist act of September 11 , which , out that the violent crime of the USA developed a chain of un@@ controlled ex@@ iled inci@@ dents .
after the 11th September , I sent my t@@ opping in a letter to President Bush ; and I said him , the way to solving this problem is in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motifs were good , but He placed him power , and which has caused unexpected consequences . &quot; he said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase of income by hand@@ shake by children in the last 4 years

&quot; children come increasingly common in these products , and unfortunately promises a percentage of them go up in the emergency power , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he told that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ant is dr@@ unk , while some do things to im@@ press your friends or im@@ press for a mutation of the social media .

more recent children can be drawn by attractive nozzle of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child might not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said , Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are well benef@@ itted .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , wine @-@ grapes and orange feet , which are very successful for children .
ham@@ mo@@ des@@ infection amounts to anywhere between 45 and 95 % of alcohol .
especially small inf@@ ants , there already were few sy@@ ring@@ es for alcohol po@@ is@@ oning .
it is highly concentrated natural product , told Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ link river in the Hospital of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would have ra@@ am any ra@@ cket of whis@@ key , but you don &apos;t let those hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant by reach of children , and if children come from it , then it is a quick opportunity to consume much alcohol .
N@@ hai@@ ku Russell , a 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had taken four sy@@ ring@@ es by the earthquake on the water of disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , has been associated with an emergency call for the treatment .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while they remained in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole year rose to 1,@@ 82 million during the same period .
initially , the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was beyond the NSC 631570 , as the figures presented by the Office of the National Statisti@@ cs ( √ñ@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland dropped to 12,000 , during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
employment rate in Scotland fell within one quarter of 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Do@@ c commented on the newest figures , and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the cor@@ nerst@@ one for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago , that Scotland becomes the historic decision , to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why people witness to a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma .
a little later than today , except in a late legal entity , I will likely take to death as a man .
and I really happened , and I hope no happens when it was done , I will be sitting in an audience h@@ ant in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the gyp@@ sy .
he was asked to be one of the four official witnesses to his death in his death .
the invitation was first made in January over his best friend , and though I had been sho@@ cked , I voted to favor .
when the day closer , I started to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I voted to agree , because I was thought to be a great way to tell the whole story about death .
it would offer a unique view .
it is true that journalists will be allowed in the USA , and as often more applications can be available as seats available , a ma@@ zes lot@@ tery will be held to choose which is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those are chosen , who will observe it alive .
I cannot reach this .
I am going to sit along with Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps and I have developed my own relationship with during the months , during the months with telephone and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often use a lot , when we speak .
the detention center shall say that I will not be a witness , and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a No@@ tiz@@ buch and a pen to draw up what I see .
I just have to remember , interested me to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma might su@@ pr@@ one to Twitter , my im@@ partial .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how it wants to you , and you will gain access .
for me , I was with her .
you &apos;ve been dre@@ dged that &quot; it would have re@@ form@@ ulate it , but let &apos;s still remember that it is doing something .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had any problem with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do it .
I have told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at all times .
but he wants to present , that an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is moving towards the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ lication of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made .
here I will not go back to all details .
I can not be sure that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is not guilty .
his actions to the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese , will make their responsibility to be a conc@@ e@@ ap of conc@@ e@@ fy .
but I believe , there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood , that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough space for there to justify his death @-@ thinking .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will die too .
I can not claim that objective .
there will be other re@@ por@@ ters who turn to it .
just what you can get from me , what it means to see a man needed to die .

a man &apos;s attempt to hanging up the police , was in vain when he was in the shallow and sum@@ p@@ ent water , only a few metres from a police officers , who tried to return , &quot; to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called for a Tuesday evening @-@ incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham , Tuesday .

&quot; he stood on the water - and said &apos; I come out , come , and get off me , &quot; said Senior Tibetan S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy is claiming that ste@@ wards attempted to attend him and threat@@ ens to end the competition .
Peter Moo@@ dy is claiming that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria had tried to install a spi@@ on into his stables , and threatened to end the race over .
he spoke on the ste@@ wards and the systems engineering department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race day treatment , the last straw had passed away on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said &quot; Fair@@ fax Media , &quot; he has always tried to do that which is best for racing , and during difficult conditions , as it was in the positive cobalt @-@ level test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had returned about 18 months because of the spi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t wanted to see it , &quot; see how high driving grapes . &quot;
&quot; I said anything , nothing to say is , and I have a long time to eat anything , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that all went out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it went further .
sometimes he re@@ acted , and you must live with the consequences , and I must live with what I &apos;ve said .
I am going to go home and well sleep here tonight .
I want to rub@@ bing a tiny , and I would like to make my owner , that I try my best to try .
when they begin to think , I do not take this , then I should not be a coach .
I must then consider what I do with my license .
prior to Moo@@ dy , in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , Moo@@ dy was in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com , that the German branch department had tried to re@@ wards its stable .
&quot; over 80 of eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Ba@@ iley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart we@@ ars in a room with a man , to make his details about what I do in my st@@ akes , to deliver , &quot; said Moo@@ dy auf Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
you think that I am a Bet@@ sy bin .
when this is the case , they should certainly stick to their story , as they are able to handle me , send her .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , former President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ as , current CEO of the country RV@@ L , have been aware of the country today and are still standing today .
should I think that I personally have to take it personally ?
has the RV@@ L season very often ; and perhaps people are responsible for train@@ ers to what is right in the industry ?
am I poor for the industry ?
am I &apos;m quite as important for the sector ?
perhaps the people think there , that I am .
perhaps they have to me my license and send me me , and I have no doubt that what I tell you can think about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where I wasn &apos;t doing it , and that doesn &apos;t just sad .
this makes me really sad .
I am going to exercise the pressure on them , and being engaged in the decision to meet .
I have done with my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ @-@ service levels of train@@ ers has set up the long @-@ lasting cobalt @-@ study on Li@@ dar@@ i and via the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching , said he said that he could have &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its author of the author , Black C@@ avi@@ ar , defined the racing @-@ day treatment instructions &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound to the equ@@ als had been marked , giving the rules against the rules .
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing sports .
I must accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my people has put a stand@@ ably mud to the leg .
there would have been yesterday evening such that night .
it would have been yesterday the whole day to be so that all this way .
it had also been on the racing day too .
Moo@@ dy could also take a three @-@ month @-@ address for the treatment with the packing on a race day . an inquiry into this affair was opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who submit these rules is nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see a one that we need rules , but here is one , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
afterwards , man was arrested in the driver .
at the weekend the police have been arrested for a meeting with a cyclist and subsequent driver in Cob@@ ram .

Melbourne @-@ Strom @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy prepared against rival for alle@@ g@@ ations for alle@@ g@@ ations .
Melbourne @-@ Strom @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has criticism against the Tac@@ cl@@ ing of his players , a &quot; agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League Favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ i@@ ke von Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rer in the Storm @-@ players &quot; team competed with his team during the high Storm @-@ winners in Sydney on Friday night &apos;s qualifying tournament .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett , a team who had reached the final victory against North Brabant co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night ; he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two were also submitted to &quot; good . &quot; in the conflict .
Bell@@ amy defended the crew of his team , and said that they have focused on the Tac@@ cl@@ ing only to their &quot; Contact &quot; .
Bell@@ amy , explained that the criticism of two the leading coach in his team has given him forward to the team , because they wor@@ ded that they didn &apos;t worry about the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; the first time today - I haven &apos;t heard that while Tr@@ ent Robinson continued to fight for different events , as she spoke to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed the whole year nothing at our def@@ ensive system or techniques . yet , in the last six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ tics as a real core , and this has made the way for us to be a possible turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years , and he is obvious a great team since exercise . he is therefore probably not to loose if so it &apos;s a bit a shock for him .
it is already funny as it appears to be back to this season again .
Bell@@ amy has gotten off the idea of the &quot; exciting football &quot; and its ment@@ or recall that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ wings plays the Premier@@ ship in the year 2010 with &quot; boring . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 , St George is a boring member , and Wayne told that he would be a good one for a decision .
but now he has a team that can play and see it as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you want to play , if you want to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play every kind of football - not every team , as Anthony Mil@@ ford , and Ben H@@ unt , thus they can play them as those games .
I have read greater confidence , because they don &apos;t tell these things because they &apos;re getting a bit of wor@@ ried up to play against us .
it was six weeks ago , they probably didn &apos;t forget to join the big game .
Bell@@ amy also directed towards the game Storm , over a higher result when the Game was par@@ co against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I &apos;ve not yet seen , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and do not score any chu@@ ck ?
for me there are the play@@ tim@@ et@@ ables .
when they relate to us , it means that we will arrive on them in a phase .
the Storm team won free , since they won the day , either North Brabant co@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ess la Sh@@ arks appeared on Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from the ticket office starting to tomorrow .

the centre makes it : every two years the car will show its new ways at the International Motor Show .

cars from the compact class cars are currently in great demand : approximately 28,@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations globally ( according to multi @-@ navigation use ( KBA ) alone accounted for this segment in August .
this reflects the position of the International Motor Show ( Audi@@ ence went 17 to 27 September ) .
between all of the futur@@ istic areas as well as new ben@@ kl@@ aters and luxury cars , we have presented many new compact models in this year .
one of the largest premieres in the German car industry is the Opel Astra , who will be able to meet with dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume of volume is also well sold , the new Astra is also not expensive , it will also be more expensive .
Opel presents a step below the major competitor VW Golf , the view , which starts at EUR 17 million .
the current Astra is starting at 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp also offer three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
differently than the most important , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra formerly used for the Astra &apos;s Opel Astra at first .
as the second variation will be followed in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also on show at the IAA .
and what will further be upgraded next to the Astra at the International Motor Show ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ ri@@ ck@@ set Met@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Met@@ gan@@ e constituted more than 5 @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT @-@ version .
in the shops , he will also be available as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ ity : very new in the segment is the Infin@@ ite Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan fans wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : 5 square metres have been deser@@ ted and decent
the Federal Constitutional Court published an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel National Justice System , the mon@@ ot@@ el@@ ang in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human tra@@ verse , in@@ mates are basically a financial compensation if they are in to small cells .
that has the Federal Constitutional Court in an end on Wednesday , by the Federal Constitutional Court .
by the judges , the judges even want to hope to spend a few days in the close rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus the ex @-@ in@@ mate was successfully concluded with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was the Minister of Justice in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell , with approximately five square meters of ground area , the toilet was not isolated .
accordingly , the man who has been on the spot with his an@@ wal@@ be , has now been re@@ located to the public in a larger cell .
he had to att@@ acking his counterpart act around the un@@ worthy arrest warrant against the State of Berlin because of un@@ worthy arrest warrant .
however , the constitutional complaint was on the judgment of the Berlin Chamber and rejected the case for the renewed inspection .
you see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber court records now over the height of the compensation
even if the legal reasons beyond the trial period only a few days of days for the compensation we had to be excluded , there was to be a compensation .
otherwise it would be a clear of the legal @-@ and @-@ finding of the person . &quot;
the chamber court must clari@@ fy the height of the labour costs .
the constitutional judge today have been strengthened the rights of in@@ mates and were often strengthened in the past .
consequently , on April an in@@ mate sentenced them to an in@@ mate damages , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
human &apos;s worthy of people is awarded to a decision in 2011 , and the majority are out of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court opened an in@@ mate in a parallel case in a parallel failure in November 2009 .
the former cure for three months was from 15 to 21 hours a day in a like @-@ like chamber as the body &apos;s body .
the pris@@ ons were also hit in the head@@ lines over recent weeks .
so the prisoners are always kept 23 hours , while aggression scale increases , even at the altitude difference due to the ten@@ sion@@ ing situation .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany this year , according to the regulations of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany , is able to record one million refugees in Germany .
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed in view of the unusual challenge of the resolution : &quot; I tell it again and again : we can create and create the things that we can create . &quot;
what is shown on Germany , conve@@ ys the following overview .
according to the different forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( the estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
there is a lack of housing , and above all with paid rental objects . a year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 scar@@ ves were out of the lease agreement , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) is why Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks will have to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 people are needed annually , and the federal government would have to invest US $ 6,@@ 4 billion a year .
agreed , scientists and Federal Minister have agreed that there must also be more stringent advantages to investment in the residential housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and vocational research , we believe that long @-@ term 55 percent of the population in Germany will be employed .
however , Germany would not take care of the refugees at Germany in order to help them to do their career , Dr. Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , played as if they are in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation assessment in the up@@ holding company , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of the immigration , he says Mig@@ ration@@ ale Dietrich Colonel Burk@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ang@@ hardt , France has given a political turn : from the Labour ban on Refu@@ ge@@ es responsible for the recognition of work .
in the effort there was a work ban on asylum seek@@ ers by up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence of asylum on asylum seek@@ ers .
in the society , above all of the disc@@ la@@ mic elements , the majority of vision is forced , in this way that refugees should be able to access the job market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the job market are in German language .
until now , there is still not a sufficient amount of general and professional @-@ related language courses .
the tests also showed that jobs are most commonly communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the plans of networks is therefore under the view of Thr@@ ash hardt to the king &apos;s integration .
the Berlin School declared that only a few @-@ mat@@ uring parents gave up their children in Kit@@ as . it is only once a very important to work together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ da@@ ble , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate .
to convince the family , still with the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration spread over in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators gone up the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would give an opportunity to increase the training capacities by increasing more technical colle@@ ges .
in the countries we have prepared students with a German language skills in welcome @-@ class classes .
they are not always trained by fully trained teacher and teachers , but also , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as second language .
some of them are not a lack , he says Be@@ ate st@@ alls at the Berlin School management .
the German student &apos;s plant had estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany are studying at home .
in principle there is no German asylum seek@@ ers or patient . the only exception in Berlin , inside @-@ talent Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
being a student @-@ old refugees who can be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a stay allowed or Dul@@ ce will not return no performances after asylum seek@@ ers . no more if they begin to study a university .
the latter is generally still receiving B@@ Af@@ √∂@@ G , as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ √∂g@@ ders .
patient and patient to have lived four years in Germany in order to be B@@ Af@@ √∂@@ G @-@ respectively , from 1 January 2016 , the margin for 15 months will be short@@ ened .
even this pro@@ ach lot must be shut down , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Permanent Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ √∂@@ G .
Islam is expected to play an important role in the future , for many people are Muslim , and for many , religion is important part of its identity .
hence the state should ro@@ ve the same rights to the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State Ch@@ urches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relation .
the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood , too , would also be able to take care of the new arri@@ vals .
the Rights also includes duties .
representatives from Islam have to be a clear contact partner , so they have to work together with the state in many fields , as well as certain control facilities .
there is also a read@@ iness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , Aim@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , informed the concern on fear , religious conflicts and to be carried through Germany .
those who wanted to say those conflicts in Germany arrived , &quot; immediately went right to stay here at times , in Germany , &quot; said he stated in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos; .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future , much more than today is an issue of the entire society .
as the majority Group has to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism are insi@@ sted .
but - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination delay with an anti @-@ discrimination Law has been published in the beginning of a decade ago .
but it was getting a slow progress , as the NSU hon@@ ors show , in the police and the authorities , was systematically en@@ camp@@ ed in the police .
the same opportunities for all : &quot; prob@@ able organizations and the stakeholders in Europe are very long . in the next few years , there will be in reality , however , that the country will be peaceful and his new citizens should be able to use their ways - the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is getting on the basis of the expected refugees to supply only medical services , she says Frank Ulrich H@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; regarding Man@@ or Power and capacities , we &apos;ve created this , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel .
but , additional money will need to flow out in the system .
to avoid confined spaces , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requested for all kinds of companies in registration of health .
they could not be converted to federal states that are expected to be expected by the German states .
and in long @-@ term , it highly un@@ question@@ able , so many people with the limited power parts were prepared to see the asylum based on asylum .
otherwise , the doctors will make sure all the language barriers .
about so far , in Berlin , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de , researchers , migrants suffered serious diseases as other patients .
not only clinics , also in Arz@@ ach@@ eries , have would have been taken over again , calls them .
it might be helped many refugees as well as with more commonly @-@ used medical an@@ cies in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
amongst refugees , there are much more recently treated with disabilities , and in the young people are HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
in addition to some other disease pictures , the German Do@@ ctors of her education , however , is clear , writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
those who love them from tuber@@ culo@@ sis and tuber@@ culo@@ sis things are not so difficult to see , &quot; people would probably be possible by the refugees if the refugees is v@@ elled . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed image system , but many refugees and even doctors .
in order to practice it , they would have to be able to re@@ locate up their qualification and if possible , if possible re@@ loc@@ ating the tests .
at least half of the coming years in Germany , according to estimates of the ple@@ chest @-@ administration data ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) is a mental illness . most patients suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress or under depression .
they viol@@ ate viol@@ ate the refugee kids , &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the University of Munich , which takes a refugee crisis in Germany for the five Syrian refugee camps .
those who suff@@ ers to a post @-@ trau@@ matic exposure from among others , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ back to breath short@@ ness , dizziness , cardiovascular and death penalty .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong ch@@ oral de@@ dness and emotional pi@@ dity .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chron@@ ically , it may be an early treatment , explained in Mun@@ z .
yet only four percent of the psych@@ ic patients migrants have received a psycho@@ therapy .
in fact , psych@@ ic MRI dra@@ fting of a motion for psycho@@ therapy can make a motion for psycho@@ therapy , but this process usually lasts several months .
in addition , the most important social workers or doctors who did not become trained in the social diseases have not trained to investigate whether treatment is necessary or not .
this lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30,000 jobs ,
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build more than 25,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and savings efforts to build the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will share its listed companies in two publicly @-@ listed companies and successfully provide the computer and printers business from his fast @-@ growing company hardware and its value @-@ activities operating activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will remain a more competitive , more sustainable cost infrastructure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chair , and Chief Executive Officer which will lead the unit after separation .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers .

FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates from the game against Dyn@@ amo Zagreb need the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger said to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and unless his rehabilitation plan is prog@@ ressing , there is no reason why he is not able to play Christmas again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario does already know that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in light of its history its participation in the next summer of the European Championship is certainly un@@ certain .
the big sensation in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate left ank@@ le injury , and then returned once again to his old s@@ late during the season .
&quot; this sort of injury does not cause the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , who has not healed .
this is no larger matter .
this was only a accident .
it stood not in connection with its kn@@ ots , or with the injuries that had previously had before .
this may be true by the other medical perspective , but how maneu@@ ver is well recognized , there is the associated risk of other injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it has also been developed very pleasant pattern .
the paper by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ √∫@@ ries Ltd has recorded 23 different sorts of Wil@@ sh@@ ere , who came to his debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ ale at 157 district Road in the last five hours .
the wider image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have one of the two Premier League clubs in six of 2007 / 08 and one of the two Premier League clubs , with the majority of injuries in the events .
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ate , but Arsenal &apos;s believes that a improvement in the vulner@@ ability committee in the past season is prolon@@ ged during the past season .
sometimes , if you arrive from an injury , you have a random period of time to strengthen your body in your body , &quot; said Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body is strong , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will have a career of your way through which he deser@@ ves .
Arsenal begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb and beat the games against Chelsea on Saturday and at the Her@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will take up a press within the teams .
H@@ √©@@ vi@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not lie to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will be starting .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with ki@@ j@@ at Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d , instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and to the players who need it , a little break break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although the F@@ unding didn &apos;t favor@@ ites , together with Group F and the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb , together with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dyn@@ amo is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign in the final season was started .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by a earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal had the apprenti@@ ces@@ hip from the last season with the Champions League sign against Monaco , previously , by far the hope to lead with his management to his first European Cup victory .
&quot; this drive is im@@ part , &quot; said Wen@@ ger said .
there has never been folded over for ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other side I have long enough for business to realistic realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are no hus@@ bands .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that uses us lessons with serious lessons .
the lack of similar represent@@ ations of the shows is obvious , especially in view of what the need for men to open up , now not more than ever before , as self @-@ dr@@ ates in young men on a 15 @-@ year date .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of men in women aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ go ( CA@@ LM ) campaign against a man &apos;s death in 2015 was the man to ask her , to seek the culture in question , to seek the help if they need them .
the heart is in combat with the heart of this challenge .
a current survey of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students , with de@@ press@@ ants , realized that when the body had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances of w@@ att@@ ing has doubled .
for those who are not de@@ press@@ ant , a circle of spir@@ it@@ ually healthy friends over the risks of mental problems .
but of course , you have to live friends , that can work with your friendship .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on style about substance , the un@@ ic@@ ity of the answer is often more important than a meaning@@ ful contact .
our digital life have the need to appear strong , life fun and successful , since , even if in reality the insulation is dominated .
this super@@ fici@@ ally recent success is dominated by psych@@ ologists and organizations ; money , image , social status , everything on costs of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our internal lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which acts strongly in on our spiritual health .
and like a video game , inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire just recently , money can not buy happiness .
the community of friends were , that it was built on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality who sh@@ one by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ &apos;s frequent sub@@ arm@@ els , visits to cozy pi@@ ers and the lon@@ ging from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can order on any case even if they often meet them to explore fully their feelings .
as a employee of the telephone show disp@@ arity , it explained me : ... &quot; my in@@ audi@@ ble roller for people who are de@@ press@@ ant . he has really shown to show me how even the smallest of friends might make a difference . &quot;
the men that contact us feel , often don &apos;t feel to talk with friends , we are happy to talk with friends .
the old expression &quot; I am now quite pretty &quot; has a huge effect , as the feeling , that it can be perceived as weakness . &quot;
Friends is one of the shows which comes to me in the sense when I try to offer a long @-@ term tac@@ tic mechanisms .
you presents quite clearly the little moments of male friend .
so much an objective : outside @-@ Status and the phone the man can look into existence of the branch of desp@@ air , the long @-@ term support is coming from a personal network of family and friends .
and so on you perform over this weekend from Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with who to attend the day a completely new designed guest , why do not take your friends at a drink in Central Peru .
or , even better , if you could see something like you in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what your friendship might be your friendship .
friends is being sent at comedy from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest

Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani reported course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain - its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ ere stadium on Tuesday .

in addition , with Real Madrid and Sh@@ ei@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also needed a strong start against the Swedish master , because they do not only strive to the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ - Round - but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals of each of the last three campaigns .
but while they were given the points , it was no Classi@@ cal pi@@ el by Laurent Blan@@ cs who missed due to the goal . he was later in play against his home town team and had his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . he was his illustri@@ ous career in the year 1999 .
this is not easy to win at home or walking back to the Champions League . therefore , there is a good start to win 2 : 0 and lay down to back and relaxed , even if it is certain things that we have to use perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good result .
we wanted to win and we didn &apos;t win even though I was sorry that we haven &apos;t achieved another two doors . &quot;
s rising in the Paris team returned after having lost three changes to the Paris team which was followed by a 2 : 2 un@@ d@@ ited to his own place at Bordeaux , but he was pier@@ ced by Paul Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean colonial city was named as the man called PS@@ G at the top level in Europe , when he was passed to Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tis Pass into the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before moving to Johan Wil@@ and pass beautiful into the long corner of the network .
if someone actually believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , the song was dis@@ appointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off proposed to achieve this stage , joined the field of nine national playing field on the field , and was going to open a five @-@ man defence team and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but in addition to a d@@ ash of Nikola D@@ jur@@ ney , who goes far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ ollen in the 3@@ 4th minute , there was some attack in the attack .
PS@@ G even gave PS@@ G itself sometimes to , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , but not least by N@@ we movi@@ c , who had not been placed in the first half of them , after Cav@@ ani had used him before re@@ boot after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless , he proved a lot of skill , when he brought his players to the game , and it was a pass of &apos; s movi@@ c , the Di Maria in a turning turning , inspired by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute to the post .
the second goal fell shortly after the drive @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his first win of the season , after Cle@@ us@@ movi@@ c had great stro@@ kes of Max@@ well .
we finished all the idea that Malm@@ √∂ drive back to the game , just an outstanding intervention of Wilson and from a very distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could result the end result before throwing at the Ez@@ ek@@ el Lav@@ o@@ zzi , whose goal was acknowledged by the end .
the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ bor , published later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league , which has not won the same level .
the quali@@ fications are not sufficient . &quot;
hat@@ s starting in Paris !
it was a great play of them !

hammer Artists shows three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) Dorn@@ bracht is one of the major works that have painted Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction of the Bible text .
at the beginning the word was ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with beautiful images .
at the beginning , the picture for Oth@@ mar Alt , who created in 150 motifs on his own personal interpret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with color@@ colours and imagin@@ ative images has the 75 year @-@ old - what un@@ far from means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images .
on the contrary , the particular themes could be adapted , the quite right weather can work .
for three years , Oth@@ mar Alt , working on his Bible project ; he had made a subj@@ ectively experienced artist from the many theme areas of &quot; book of books . &quot;
it emerged about the cycles of the Cross , Pl@@ ague , cerem@@ onies , and the cerem@@ onies , or : Jesus .
thus , he was fascinated several partners , the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological feature as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main emphasis on art books .
in particular , it is the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , referring to the authors of painting with the respective translation .
he has interpreted the verses from Ot@@ mar , selected a Bible verses and so in today it is translated into fellow con@@ jun@@ ctions . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original German translation of Martin Luther and each set in a set of the artist who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewellery plate has golden type .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows for a profound insight into his soul , his emotions .
its high level of in@@ timacy .
it all was the reason for the Bible Project : Oth@@ mar Alt , 1940 , in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the rigor@@ ous royal throne .
&quot; at the time when they had already occurred with the pipe system , &quot; vo@@ mar Alt .
&quot; I tried to understand this , perhaps we may wear again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second aim is to be added to the art in a high @-@ lasting time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising and the is according to the order .
effectively , symbol@@ ism is used .
artists have something like @-@ like and sale , things to show things .
there are always something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
when the viewer admi@@ lls , the viewers would like to let them go . they feel free to keep them and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for over . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was closed on Tuesday at the demonstration of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the so @-@ called &quot; lovers of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like , how he enter with his pictures . &quot;
alt - I did not rely on the Bible , but those chosen for him important , also mystery issues .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye @-@ level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost . &quot; here it &apos;s about the images the text might be explained . &quot; it was a great pictures from the Bible .
for Hans M√∂@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find out his life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Pictures speak for M√∂@@ hler &apos;s ( biblical ) language and love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and lin@@ changing images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on November 15th in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .

in fact , the people in Germany are still not willing to leave a self @-@ rolling vehicle .
according to a survey of digital converter , only seven percent would agree to agree on all roads to complete the streets .
on the national highway , water flow through 15 percent , through traffic flow would be 45 percent .

guided purely Internet walk of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Ci@@ sti@@ g ) , which is to be seen from September 18th , is a lucky insi@@ sted that the musical tre@@ ach@@ ter has changed his position as a look at its own .
actually I would have been on the other hand , for example : &quot; for me a bit came a bit to death , &quot; he said .
if you die , you come into the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken out in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more as limited clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsthalle , Roger Die@@ deren .
it &apos;ll go to tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into what is hardly noticed at the impression of man &apos;s own fashion in fashion &apos;s history without ever did a training .
chron@@ ology is not built , but it is a well @-@ known chore@@ ographic over total work of art , which was operated for much maintenance effort : in order to character@@ ize her d@@ olls , for example , a stylish style .
14 tons of materials have s@@ mil@@ ed by the c@@ ach@@ ers of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , Munich .

there are also selected by the show Ted@@ dy , can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tw@@ ined fashionable tests of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he used to show Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and Dresses .
after playing a pupp@@ et , his parents have not allowed him to him .
I throw from mode , he then moved themselves to himself .
he studied fashion magazines and looked for studies by other designers , where Gaul@@ tier in Munich .

they were not needed , but they were able to keep the cl@@ ots .
instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ isch@@ ke head as fashion @-@ N@@ ish
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery to make a few metres .
the embroi@@ dered substances and heads were created in much bronze for customers that she worked for carpets and curtains .
the only work currently works , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the lead screw Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion has again important .
in the initial times of the Pl@@ um tip , mode has a larger role , was sold by the textile heading of oil and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt will name several examples : top in jewelry , in accessories like bags and in regional Tra@@ chten .
all bil@@ ly is the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which stretches into the past styles , is an increasing flavor potential .
and those who are not able to operate in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
they already make up the half of all contracts .
mo@@ ster heat Pl@@ auen and has been a member of the industry association of Pl@@ ate head and embroi@@ der@@ ings together with nine other members .
only them are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of its sales are broken away .
there are almost any private specialty shops and wholesale market , you are almost no longer .
our products are still possible to reach our customers by this way .
the mass @-@ ware are produced in Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains .
the export of the export is outlined on Russia and the US .
so , have sufficient reasons for a new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have one quality seal , which shows that we have ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; the refers to the materials used &quot; are also used . &quot;
trained as a diplom@@ at , U@@ te Schmidt is being teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg region of the western Academy of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of Applied Arts and can be specialized on embroi@@ dery and tips .
to the competition from the Asian region , you must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
they need time and courage .
this is a voltage range between those fresh ideas of designers and premises that must think above all concerns , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is up only slightly , to keep a customer base .

EU wants to double the mercury limit in smokers .
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large volumes , making it a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which is to participate in an appropriate member draft in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for &quot; risks and adverse events to promote gay and inf@@ ants . &quot; he declared Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt is said to have some limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , as for example Hai@@ - or pri@@ med fish , can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams per kilogra@@ m of fish .
big pir@@ ated fish are nevertheless so strong so strongly that mercury can not be loaded on the basis of some 50 % of the F@@ ancy not to be sold .
according to dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ compatible .
because of this upgrade , the EU aims to implement the limit values in other f@@ ishings up of 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams per kilogra@@ m of mercury .
the other but not known as &quot; tri@@ ck , &quot; because smaller do@@ fish , like approximately car@@ p are mostly low as low , they withstand the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the wanted lowering of the slide is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ ou@@ st die man@@ oeuvre , which helps its economy in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wolfgang schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
