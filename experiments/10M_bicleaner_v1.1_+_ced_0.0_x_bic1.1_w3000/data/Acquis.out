B ) This agreement stays as long as force in force , as the states of the Treaty of the Treaty .
the agreement used in this agreement means &quot; Convention &quot; means the Convention and the Protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to apply in the implementation of the Con@@ s I via securing measures as required .
the aim of the securing measures taken in this Convention is the tim@@ ely discovery of a significant amount of nuclear arsen@@ al of peaceful nuclear devices for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear warfare for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a junction by the risk of early discovery .
to achieve the target set in Article 28 , the materials accounting as a securing measure of fundamental importance , to be used with the spatial input and the observation of important supplem@@ ental measures .
the technical conclusion of checks by the organization is performed by an explanation , in which is not listed for a specific period of material , which is listed for a particular period of accuracy limits for the specified measuring range .
when carrying out their checks , the organization makes 3 full use of the f@@ use system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material design zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make the following type of use and they , as far as required , fore@@ see how they are determined in the complem@@ entary measures and are practical :
a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of temper@@ ed , shi@@ fted , lost , lost or in other ways from continu@@ ance on core material and inventory ;
B ) evalu@@ ating re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and accuracy of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Proce@@ dures to determine assessment and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipi@@ ents ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essments not measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which refers to the core material inventory and changes of the properties , including one - and outputs of the material bil@@ isation zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences that ensure that the account@@ ants and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after the Convention does not extend to materials in the mining or the arch@@ ore .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ nal material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle which has not yet been achieved in the states , the community of the organisation is divided into the amount and composition of the material , provided it is not used for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material that is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ enrich@@ ment , in which it is produced , or , this core material or other , introduced into the United States , is subject to the others in this Convention .
a ) The requirements used in this Convention will not be specified for nuclear material under the requirements specified in Article 11 , but the community is , however , that the recovery of the core material is subject to the agreement that is not possible or desired in accordance with this agreement , the organisation and community must consult each other via the application of appropriate backup measures .
B ) In this conven@@ ing securing measures , the requirements for nuclear materials will be termin@@ ated in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community must be respected , that this core material is practically non @-@ profit .
based on the community , the Organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when it is used in grams or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nuclear material , if it is used at non @-@ nuclear actions after Article 13 , if such a core material is back@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
according to the community , the Organization set free to set up the organisation &apos;s core material , which otherwise will be subject to the conven@@ tions under this conven@@ tions , as long as the entire , due to this article in the states freed core material quantity at no time more than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 % ( 20 % ) and over , calculated by the multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and over the by natur@@ alist , it is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying of his weight with a five @-@ hour square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium enrich@@ ing an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
the free core material , along with core material , is to be handled or stored in the securing measures in this agreement , processed or stored , so pre @-@ recur@@ sions for the recovery of the securing measures are taken to that material .
the community meets supplem@@ entary ass@@ essments , which is necessary in the scope of determining the successful and effective path@@ way of the organisation according to this agreement , in individual determine how to apply in the procedure specified in the Convention .

a recur@@ rence for blood group content must react with all tested blood samples that contain the tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g , the antibodies or another on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or appearances are not occur : a ) em@@ oly@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured in a suitable medium by constantly re@@ lu@@ ding of the recur@@ rence in a suitable medium .
the title is the recur@@ rence of the number of the strongest power dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood flow in the total volume .
anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which should be used on object dreams , activity is expressed by the time required for an ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ determination International standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are currently working standards .
a International standard presence contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is ir@@ respective of the titles that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floods .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present for the International standard pre@@ par@@ ate ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed by the International standard presence or state nor@@ ate par@@ at in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if they bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B are included in accordance with 256 International Units per ml .
the preparations are available free from the International Labor@@ at@@ orio for biological standards of the World Health Organisation , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative Tit@@ ration of the International Standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ acts ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , the required characteristics will remain for at least one year .
the expi@@ ration date of a recur@@ rence , according to the label , is not a year after the last satisfied efficacy test .
this is due to the expi@@ ration date for drying contracts , according to the results of the expi@@ ration tests ; it is appro@@ ach@@ able by government control authorities .
dr@@ y@@ reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of domestic gas or vacuum in a vacuum cleaner , in which it has been dried up and that is so closed , that no moisture may enter .
a dry @-@ respon@@ ds may not lose at least 0.5 b.@@ H. its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ oric acid at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg ( 24 hours ) .
to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic will continue to maintain the requirements for speci@@ f@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group @-@ determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein @-@ nitrogen per ml liquid or re @-@ dissolved server .
reag@@ ents , simultaneous , whether in cash or after recovery , must be transparent and must not contain se@@ di@@ ments nor gel@@ ding or visible particles .
the exchange for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ determination should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least as long as not until an International Convention has come about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ determination are in such ways and spread in such quantities that this is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so great that the contents may be used to carry out in this protocol described as efficacy test .
the manufacturing process has over all output levels and controls of reag@@ ents for blood group @-@ determination to lead written records .
reasonable samples of all out reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory for so long to be accepted by some probability that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ent determination used for blood group determination can contain substances human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these constitute the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and maintaining stability of the re@@ acts .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents contain substances of human origin .
on each single container , a black printed label is printed in English and French , the following details contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid solution necessary ,
also , this label or label on the box , in which the individual containers are located , or that included the containers required : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid solution necessary ,
each shipment has a certificate according to Article 4 of the Agreement corresponding to this protocol .
