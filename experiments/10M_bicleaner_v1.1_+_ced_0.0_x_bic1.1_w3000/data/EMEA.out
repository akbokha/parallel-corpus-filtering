it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ ls and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic condition , altern@@ ating the patients lack of periods ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) , altern@@ ating periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat medium to severe man@@ ic episodes and to proph@@ etic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past to the medicine .
injection solution is used for rapid control of stri@@ ped rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , when the oral medicine is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution enables to intake or the melt tablets in patients , which prepare the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
patients receiving other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be reduced to the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ it@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells .
presumably , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol seems to be described as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or some symptoms and will be prevented .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered in increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was diagnosed on twelve weeks of 347 patients suffering from Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which have been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy in which the various symptoms were stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was administered in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from mo@@ dest@@ ine ag@@ itation , which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of patients suffering from a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment was investigated .
the company also led out studies in order to investigate how the body re@@ adily absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution .
in the two studies with the injection solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for treating the bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of some more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented from up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo which res@@ emble man@@ ic episodes at previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , stomach @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased memory ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Evi@@ dence Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy was at the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole led to the risks .
moreover , the Committee met the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of stri@@ ped anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a approval for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the whole European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a constant dose of 15 mg / day a day independent of meals .
an increased efficacy of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mono@@ therapies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower Initi@@ al dose should be considered when clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ ben@@ zene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to mental disorders and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder had no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ as opposed to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , mal@@ function distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reducing medicines ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ credi@@ tor and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials published a year or less , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
if in one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms that signi@@ fies on a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at intervals related to sei@@ zu@@ res .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole associated with psych@@ oses who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , increased risk of dying from placebo compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study involving fi@@ xer dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug @-@ treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain as a side effect is known , respectively , and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should similar dose reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism can cause the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as iso @-@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ rot@@ ors , should probably have similar effects and therefore , similar dose reductions should be made .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ bone at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ological morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of in@@ adequate data security in humans and due to those in reproductive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machinery , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene has no negative influence on them .
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the specified side effects were defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis were compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed with a placebo treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients suffering from Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in a different study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with op@@ ium treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse reactions that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ous and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ do@@ si@@ ties with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg .
although , no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment in the treatment of a do@@ cking with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however , it is unlikely that hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of a do@@ cking of benefits is because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene has a high plasma integration .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol showed a high aff@@ inity for Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor , as well as an excessive aff@@ inity for Dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and to hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
at the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Pos@@ it@@ ans @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ing reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at cleaning .
in three placebo @-@ controlled shor@@ tw@@ age studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statistically significant more significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 percent of the patient &apos;s share was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ r@@ alen , which were defined as secondary studio targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions @-@ scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate was observed in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were involved in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ studies with flexible application of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol showed an superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ study about 3 weeks with a fi@@ xer dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed no superior efficacy against placebo no superior efficacy .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol showed superior to placebo within week 3 and a substantial effect that was comparable to lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene also showed a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mono@@ therapies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .

dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was diagnosed with op@@ i@@ be@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were involved in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ study about 3 weeks with a fi@@ xer dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed no superior efficacy against placebo no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , which was compared to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form to healthy volunteers , the ratio was compared to the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value and value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 out of that , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ ther was found as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ ic@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ rics ( AU@@ C ) from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which lead to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical average dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ ting solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ul@@ arity and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ine injection should be termin@@ ated and using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection can be recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be administered depending on the individual clinical status , considering the product &apos;s maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ine is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution .
there are no investigation on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ine injection solution in patients suffering ag@@ ul@@ arity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen is additionally considered to be considered necessary , the patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions are not available for patients with alcohol or disease @-@ pois@@ oning ( by disp@@ le@@ ased or illegal drug ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , mal@@ function distur@@ ban@@ ces ) , cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reducing medicines ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ credi@@ tor and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials published a year or less , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known and un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared with the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a single source intra@@ muscular was administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ ously at the same time ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ rot@@ ors , should probably have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
according to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ bone at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ ously received , was the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation greater compared with the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the specified side effects were defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was treated in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was diagnosed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from op@@ ium treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters found no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse reactions that occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ous and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements in A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness / behavi@@ ors associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ine injection was associated with a statistically significant ampli@@ fication in the symptoms concerning placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed improvement from the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
analysis of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ dity , was observed a similar efficacy in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be observed because of a reduced patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled shor@@ tw@@ age studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( oral ) demonstrated statistically significant more significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled study was 52 percent of the proportion of patients receiving an response to study medication , similar to both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ r@@ alen , which were defined as secondary studio targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depress@@ ant scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in response rate was observed in 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included and in which the primary study rate of weight gain was reduced by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mono@@ therapies with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in front of the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar return .
the arith@@ me@@ ben@@ zene AU@@ C is higher than the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection 90 % higher the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two for@@ mut@@ ations .
in 2 trials with healthy volunteers were given the average time until reaching the maximum plasma fluid at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target group after repeated treatment in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive par@@ x@@ iz@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns according to maternal ex@@ position , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) was over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( oral ) for security mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , reproductive par@@ ity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and a can@@ o@@ gene@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no special dangers for human beings .
Tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only at dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when humans are significantly exceeded , so they have limited or no significance for the clinical use .
the effects re@@ mot@@ ions a dos@@ is@@ dependent secondary @-@ cell @-@ accumulation ( AU@@ C ) in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the 3 @-@ 10 times the intermediate @-@ state sub@@ sidy / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the intermediate @-@ end @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .

the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medication ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients to treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
consider only the patients who were first treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy and survival as the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer resulted in regards to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it must also not be used in patients that have breast@@ feeding or before the onset of treatment low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation in the blood .
the D@@ MP Committee on Human@@ ist &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was containing patients who had no more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted an approval for the office of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ y number &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy while the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ ory re@@ rop@@ athy 3 is the treatment to break , until the improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there were no trials carried out with patients with inter@@ fere kidney function , and there is currently no sufficient data to use dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data on the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ax@@ el , which could have a significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine was promp@@ ted immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while being clearly detected with Abra@@ x@@ ane in the context of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , cardi@@ ology are not unusual in the inde@@ xed patient collective , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if patients are treated according to the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tika and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive powers .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used at pregnant women or women in the camp @-@ able age which are not effective for treating the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el as the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in am@@ aged age should be used during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable verification method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , will be recommended , during and up to six months after the treatment no child is witness .
male patients should be consul@@ ted before treatment on a sperm cell , because Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy is the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( often ) , which can impact on the traffic and the ability to serve machines .
these are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects , performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ tically ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , side effects are performed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mono@@ therapies at any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lact@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased blood sugar , increased potassium in the blood , reduced potassium in blood .

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of the hyper@@ sensitivity reaction is calculated based on a definitive definition in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and no caus@@ al relation was established with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active substance that promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules and stabili@@ zed mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing of their de@@ formations .
this stabil@@ isation leads to an inhibit@@ ing of normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ ational inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is convey@@ ed into the trans@@ ac@@ yt@@ osis of plasma cl@@ eic acids in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies , that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in stimul@@ ates the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ epi@@ theli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ by protein SP@@ ARC ( soli@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two randomised trials and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparison study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ ent@@ ric study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , either in the form of solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 mg / m2 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion with no pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 229 ) .
for inclusion in the study , 64 % of the patients had an interfer@@ ed state condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had yet received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asi@@ fication and 19 % for metast@@ asis .
9 . results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are laid down below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived in therapy to periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for 3 years .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for res@@ sources on Bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and continues to be unknown .
drug ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el for 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the drug ex@@ position ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accord@@ ing to intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma plasma received in multi@@ phase .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover integration of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after Abra@@ x@@ ane &apos;s gift ( 43 % ) compared to a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution of distribution was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of the human liver micro@@ some and ri@@ p@@ coating it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the average total dose of less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
in the age of more than 75 years , only a few data are available , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ protected light over 8 hours .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the owner of approval for office workers will be provided to medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• School brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packs of packages . • With a clear picture of the product required cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that abor@@ tion is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; Reference Sub@@ stances &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood cell values , where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible , and in which a blood @-@ loss of 900 to 1 800 m@@ L is expected .
treatment with abor@@ tions must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases which is shown for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood circulation , abor@@ tions in a v@@ ein is inj@@ ected .
injection can also be done by the patient or his counsel@@ or , as long as they have received an appropriate guidance .
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency or patients receiving chemotherapy should always be recommended in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per day in adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to control , to ensure that no iron deficiency , and iron ore , should be administered throughout the treatment .
patients receiving chemotherapy alone or patients with kidney problems may cause an@@ a@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or thereby that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby imp@@ ose the consequences of a blood pressure loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa .
abor@@ tion was compared with administration as an injection into a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference case .
all of the patients participating in this study was inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene inj@@ ected either before they were either transferred to Ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indi@@ ces for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values between the beginning of the study and the application period in weeks 25 to 29 .
furthermore , the company continued the results of a study prior to investig@@ ating the effects of the skin with the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values were reported in the same size as with those who continued to mark E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ l. of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which occasionally affect symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inking headache and confusion .
abor@@ tions must not be used in patients who may potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa or one of the other components .
abor@@ tions as an injection below the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that these cannot be triggered by allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the medicine was provided for demo@@ li@@ tion in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , rest@@ oring abor@@ tions , will provide information about the medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the security of the medicine .
on August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , giving a approval to the office and transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fu@@ sions in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or numer@@ ical my@@ el@@ oma that receive chemotherapy , and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion ( i.e. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia was present at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if bleeding measures are not available or in@@ adequate , for larger operating conditions ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for a reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications is expected .
( HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood @-@ loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot be able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / d@@ l. ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for pap@@ al patients who should lie the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
infectious symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ ations may vary depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical start and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally be observed with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster stability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be reached by 10 g / d@@ l. ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l. ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value exceeds 12 g / d@@ l. ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is needed for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher yield doses than patients where the initial an@@ emia is less hard ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary , with a dose @-@ increase of 25 to / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
infectious symptoms and - follow @-@ up charges may vary depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical start and disease resistance is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster stability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be reached by 10 g / d@@ l. ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / d@@ l. ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored closely to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is needed for control of infectious symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value at least 1 g / d@@ l. ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ ring number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose should be increased from 150 to / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster growth &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the recur@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 or kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 or / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ ring number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , should be retained three times per week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the recur@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion rose by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be cancelled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , with whom the prescribed installation of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative is needed , should be abor@@ ted twice weekly in a dose of 600 , or kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme - began to be available before start @-@ off therapy great iron reserves .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 and / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 or kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a di@@ oc@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug in circulation .
patients who are suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ast@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive off@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ en@@ ie ) .

controlled clinical studies have no significant benefit which is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ ins , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster concentration on the control of infectious symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required concentration .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster increase should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l. ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in relation to each patient who should also consider specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who under@@ take a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded from treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with an output equivalent value of &gt; 13 g / dl which can be increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not demonstrated that , with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , they can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor disease .

during treatment with abor@@ tions , it can come to a slight dos@@ ing rise in the standard area to a slight dos@@ ing number , which re@@ produces back in further treatment .
your doctor will eventually conduct regular blood tests to control the number of blood vessels during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood @-@ loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or Fol@@ acid deficiency , should take into consideration and treated with abor@@ tions before the start of therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ malign@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ en@@ ie for months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em ( under the skin inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ op@@ en@@ ie , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with fl@@ amed and set how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore abor@@ tions must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in increased or rising potassium , your doctor may consider dis@@ rup@@ ting treatment with abor@@ tions , until the potassium values are back in the norm range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically @-@ evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust levels by in@@ sufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster levels does not exceed a certain value .
after the detection of detection is not accelerated by the treatment of blood pressure with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , progression of ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between Epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the desired effect should be taken into consideration for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of abor@@ tions .
200 your doctor regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ coloured ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and custom@@ ize your query dosage to minim@@ ize the risk of a blood glucose ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be carefully controlled from the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , especially if you are an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are ob@@ ese ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) , or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ om@@ i@@ mb@@ osis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
if you are cancer patients , consider that abor@@ tions work like a growth factor for blood cells and can affect the tumor in certain circumstances .
if you have a greater orthop@@ edic operation , before treatment with abor@@ tions , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive abor@@ tions , as an increased risk of blood glucose levels after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when you use other drugs / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with lax@@ ative , your doctor will eventually arrange certain blood studies to measure the blood levels of c@@ ic@@ los@@ ers .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ a@@ emia ) is on the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may submit regular blood tests to check treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly , and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses ranging from 25 to 50 to / kg twice a week , spread over two identical injec@@ tions .
your doctor may submit regular blood tests to check treatment success and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value is not exceeding certain value .
depending on how the an@@ emia speaks on the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until the state is under control .
to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value does not exceed a certain value , the treat doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to reduce the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 kg / kg can be given in 10 consecutive days before the operation , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , you can learn if your doctor keeps this for appropriate , even learn how you spl@@ end@@ our yourself into your skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , pul@@ mon@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , pul@@ mon@@ osis of the ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women and men@@ opause , as well as in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fra@@ gment risk ( bone erup@@ tions ) , including in patients who recently had suffered a slightly trau@@ matic envelope as they had suffered ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with envelope should be taken before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , and headache .
in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was attracted to zom@@ eta by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ra@@ ines and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years who recently had suffered from hip frac@@ tures ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with a risk of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
the main indi@@ ces for the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme which builds bone sub@@ stance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to placebo was reduced by 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures increased by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a questionnaire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients suffering from placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur in the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequently in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may potentially sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ yl is liable to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extinction of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta is providing recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ ci@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients where the effects of the drug may be explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Europe &apos;s Limited Company issued an approval for the marketing of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the gu@@ ardian frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long R@@ emis@@ siv@@ ity was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium daily , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients with a recent decline in low @-@ trau@@ matic gu@@ ardi@@ ans is recommended by an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen by using Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ cu@@ sta is not recommended , since limited clinical experiences for this patient group are present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended to use for the use of children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data are missing for dis@@ comfort and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since these patient population are only limited clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ a@@ emia has sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary increase in the symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ mia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be used before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental investigation with a reasonable preventive tooth treatment .
for patients who need dental problems , there are no data available if the treatment of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ ress .
the clinical evaluation by the treatments should be the basis of the treatment plan of any patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the gift of acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen by using Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse adverse effects were reported in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall incidence of predi@@ sposition between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney problems associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( year prior to administration ) and incidence of kidney failure , as well as a limited kidney function , were similar in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for three years , comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of stock was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory tests , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values found below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures following a recent frac@@ tional frac@@ tures , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid in a large clinical study was reported above local reactions in the in@@ fusion body , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen , in the or@@ tho@@ or , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the or@@ tho@@ ress ) , reports with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients to Z@@ ah@@ nex@@ tra@@ ctions or other dental attack .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients underwent oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the ja@@ w field with an acet@@ sta and patients treated with placebo .
in the case of an overdose that leads to a clinical relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year has been observed in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ged ( BM@@ D ) score or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ist fra@@ gment .
effects on morph@@ ometric an@@ ec@@ tures en@@ la@@ sta significantly decreased over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ra@@ ils ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an unchanged effect of three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine at 6.7 % , the total hips around 6.0 % , the cord rose by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the reservoir .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with acet@@ sta &apos;s patients compared to placebo increasing the tra@@ se@@ cular bone volume and preser@@ vation of the tra@@ se@@ cular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months , significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value until 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
impact on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ ci@@ sta treatment in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the BM@@ D as compared to placebo treatment and shr@@ ank p@@ als for all points of time .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to placebo treatment over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total th@@ a@@ isons and at 4.3 % on the shr@@ ank p@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ized and at 185 patients , the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study involving males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ annual administration of acet@@ sta in comparison to the pro@@ cent@@ ric change in the Len@@ den@@ wir@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D was not inferior to 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radical confir@@ ming of the bone of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influenced compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a respon@@ sive study at the end of the six months study ( on the therapy had been addressed ) .
of the 143 patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was 141 of patients treated with risk provision@@ ing , compared with 71 of patients treated with risk provision@@ ing , in an average duration of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that as dos@@ is@@ independently proved .
after that , plasma welding rose quickly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0,1 % of the maximum value .
fast bi@@ ph@@ onic disappearance of circulation cycle times t ½ to 0.@@ 24 and t 1 ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with an termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ um@@ wer@@ age t and ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned 2 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion on the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the dose observed in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma percentage against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of through Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme - metabolic substances is impro@@ bable because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is not yet metab@@ oli@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this makes it possible that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and excessive kidney failure to down to a cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of ci@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
because of heavy kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , these population are not possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ eye @-@ effective intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ multiple of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application has been administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that equals 6 times the human therapeutic exposure that corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and on the intraven@@ ous injec@@ tor .
the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ative primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result that reflected the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formations and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal toxic@@ ity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest serum @-@ calcium mirror .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the preparation time and conditions before the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C and 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

removable blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass which is observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is established , which makes the bone structure we@@ aker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone structure , ensuring a normal bone formation , thereby gives strength to the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or to under@@ go a dental surgery , please inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care personnel if you use other drugs / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you take pharmac@@ euticals , from which it is known that it is fo@@ aming the kidneys .
in use of acet@@ sta , together with food and beverages , you are worried that you can take care of your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .

in addition , four studies on more than 7 000 patients were carried out in which A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA was deployed to placebo in comparison to placebo .
however , studies on the setting of smokers showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA was severely affected on this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts were observed in connection with A@@ CO@@ MP@@ L@@ IA .
it must also be used in patients that suffer from an existing heavy depression or with antidepress@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and among other things , among others , a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ d@@ ge@@ thers .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) is assessed by means to recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not displayed . • It can be used together with another diabe@@ tic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in Pati@@ ents ( in particular overweight patients ) can be applied to met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose not satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily .
in combination with a sulph@@ on@@ yl alcohol or insulin , the previous dose of sulph@@ on@@ yl alcohol or insulin can be maintained with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used in better and reduces blood sugar levels , making it better to adjust type 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ on@@ yl alcohol , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in the studies , concentration of a substance was measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that blood glucose levels have been lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional treatment of acet@@ in and a sulph@@ on@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional treatment of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients were examined , the patients who under@@ took Ac@@ tos in addition increased to decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % compared to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos cannot be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ ones ) .
it has been decided that acet@@ one should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited sent a permission to enter Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
the tablets are white , circular , circular , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ adequate ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are endangered through presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin is used .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase of reports on cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency was revealed , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver function ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirrors can be increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , liver en@@ co@@ effici@@ ents are soon to control as soon as possible .
if a patient developed symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , th@@ at@@ op@@ pressive stress , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to verify the liver function of the liver .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be led by the laboratory parameters from the clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ ing weight gain was detected , which can stir in fatty deposits and associated with a liquid form in some cases .
as a result of a hem@@ or@@ it@@ ac@@ on , a low @-@ level reduction in the medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ atology ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who have Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or triple combination therapy with insulin or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ mean@@ ings a direct connection , but im@@ ent doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ fle@@ ction if patients are concerned about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic statement should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ red events , randomised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or enter this , the treatment is decre@@ asing ( see paragraph 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ologically dynamic of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are metab@@ oli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one decreased in the pregnancy , hyper@@ ten@@ an@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of breast canc@@ ers , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the killing growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
these result in a temporary change of the turbine and the re@@ frac@@ tive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege have emerged about three times the upper limit of the norm range as frequently as under Placebo but less frequently than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w was higher than placebo .
since the market launch , rare above heart failure was reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac in@@ suff@@ iciency was applied in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it was conducted a summary analysis of messages undes@@ i@@ rable , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative groups .
over a period of 3.5 years of running PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day after seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ative Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ ings in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal than Mon@@ otherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal ) .
in a placebo controlled trial of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite the three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continue only insulin ; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ator compared to the initial values .
the effects of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week evaluation of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and a rise of the HD@@ L@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as mar@@ gin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plastic glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed , whereas Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ci@@ dal values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the shift tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ den@@ dial @-@ den@@ ced tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this also on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ TIV@@ E study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease were randomised in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after the oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is re@@ adily absor@@ bent , with the peak concentrations of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in plasma usually can be reached 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the M @-@ IV contribution is based on effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ologically dynamic by dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radioactive sp@@ ell@@ ular Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and at a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination period of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ re@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the Mother &apos;s soli@@ ds are similar .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not able to utili@@ ze insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks , concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in was measured in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that blood sugar levels were equally strongly lowered with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who are possibly exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) on human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane might have to be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may have effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to be removed ) .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the office of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , if a fast @-@ initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
injec@@ tions must be loaded under the skin at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ glyc@@ emia warning system can be perceived and should be advised .
each change regarding strength , mark ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( quick @-@ acting , bi@@ ph@@ onic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( non @-@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin or insulin ) can result in a change of the dosage .
if the shift to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is required , if the patient is required , it can be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients who have hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning of an hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia affects less or less than in its previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , as such travels may be used to use insulin and meals to other times .
the doctor therefore have to consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy and the patient will always ask for other drugs .
4 . hypo@@ glyc@@ emia as well as hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ sufficient di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in u@@ ter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can lead to consciousness and / or sei@@ zu@@ res and end with temporary or lasting distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood glucose monitoring can be associated with complaints which are known as acute pain neu@@ rop@@ athy and normally are reversible .
5 A Inten@@ si@@ fication of insulin therapy with a corrupt improvement of the blood sugar level can however be associated with a temporary deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
disorders of the skin and the skin cell tissue Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y In the In@@ jection Screen can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y , when failed to switch the depos@@ iting within the injec@@ table .
general conditions and complaints at the administration of Gel@@ eg@@ acci@@ dentally - Local survival reaction during the insulin therapy can occur local survival reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .

a hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can however develop infin@@ itely variable : • Easy hypo@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated through oral inhal@@ ation of glucose or glucose foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have Trau@@ ben@@ ches , sweets , biscuits , or glucose fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness are treated with intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) , by a proven auxili@@ ary or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire actual duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is due to the product that it is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of administration ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been dra@@ gged on ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split .
based on the conventional studies on security mac@@ ro@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and for reproductive power , the pre@@ clinical data will not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane flow bottle from the fridge was taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is stressed according to the operation manual for the first use .

this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) is assessed by the study to provide recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
the primary effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , Insul@@ in Human ( DNA ) , is manufactured using the process of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can influence blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the office of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the whole European Union .
when two types of insulin is mixed , first the amount of insulin has to be re@@ activated , then the amount of insulin has increased .
3 If the shift to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d is required for patients a dose of dose , it can be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after switching .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor , as such travels may be used to use insulin and meals to other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hypertension ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent larger surgical procedures , has shown that a reduced mortality rate decreased by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum percentage is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire actual duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and young people the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , the assumption that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile is similar in children and adolescents from adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ one in concentrations 0.05 % sodium chloride , 5 % D glucose and 10 % glucose in the in@@ fusion fluid with 40 m@@ mol / l potassium chloride are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already demonstrated signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ances , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plast@@ er@@ mark ( i.e. stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone removal ) .
if the ur@@ inary tract is still above 6 mg per day , the dose can be increased to a dose of 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment of treatment , toxic waste can occur ; therefore , the patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines for the prevention of gyp@@ cht@@ es .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , at which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol applied to 300 mg daily in a dose of once ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the primary inde@@ b@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary levels in the blood was under 6 mg / d@@ l. of the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once had a dose of 120 mg each day , at the last three measurements an u@@ alty @-@ proof of the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l. .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in the case of placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart problems in history , possibly also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ istic Cra@@ cker ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood stream in blood , but also an increased risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history , present or present in Gi@@ cht@@ osis and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) .
if the serum value of the serum for 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase can be taken to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
patients with severe kidney imp@@ air@@ ment were not fully investigated for efficacy and safety so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tin Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young@@ sters Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t If there is no experiences in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ oral heart disease or de@@ com@@ pressive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
like with other har@@ n@@ eic acid drugs , it may occur during the treatment of a acute toxic@@ ity because of the rapid lowering of the serum levels , the ure@@ aci@@ dic removal will be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in urine is so far as to increase it into ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During the clinical studies of phase 3 , slight injuries of the liver function were observed in the patients treated with Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform in the beginning of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ o@@ zone treatment and further development in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was performed no exchange studies on Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ e@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ spi@@ der ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects was associated with the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 @-@ shirts were not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose to be used for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study involving human subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x contains a medium 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ b@@ min , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which refers to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( about 1 hour ) is delayed and a decrease of C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies can &apos;t be close to side effects of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ e@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see paragraph 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serve machines or in exercising hazardous activities , until they can be reas@@ onably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was unable to adver@@ tise their performance .
a paid higher incidence of incidence reported cardiovascular events in the overall f@@ eb@@ in@@ ol group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the Pi@@ vot@@ al study ( 1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no cog@@ nitive connection with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ o could be detected .
the risk factors associated with these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis erotic illness and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , or a dis@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could rise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and in all Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , more than once reported , are listed below .
diarrhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials did not have severe skin effects or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reaction .
7 Open long term renewal studies in the open long term extension studies were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg were treated .
during the long @-@ term - extension studies reported related events were similar to those reported in the studies of Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatments were reported in all Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ e@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and have received 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) .

clinical study results of the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two Pi@@ vot@@ al Studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study described below ) , which were carried out with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ op@@ en@@ emia and g@@ out .
primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients who had the last three monthly oral levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum concentration of the study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ L .
in terms of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statistically significant consideration of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed at the physician visit in week 2 and maintain lasting over the whole treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum concentration &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function of the AP@@ EX study assessed the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum for serum concentration of serum , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with heavy kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l. .
in two years the data collected in the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients had needed to decrease the incidence of toxic waste ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a toxic@@ ation ) .
this was associated with a reduction of tox@@ in size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete elim@@ ination of plast@@ er@@ notes by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ves ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum Plas@@ ma@@ ins percentage ( C@@ max ) and the surface area below the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ aci@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration was simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ portion increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration in serum samples has been observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma connection of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary ties to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is consistent with concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed predominantly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , about 49 % of the dose of urine was found in the urine as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion on the urine , about 45 % of the dose is also found as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ cur@@ sive metabolism of the drug ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .

the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 times from 7.5 m / h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m / h / ml in the group with heavy kidney function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are brow@@ sing ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D levels exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin supplement ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of cooking tubes , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company used data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than for those who only income al@@ end@@ ron@@ at revenue ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data that suggests that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is required for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the movement ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive function such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( bladder infections ) , ul@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhoea ( b@@ unk@@ y ) , dil@@ uted abdom@@ en ( b@@ lown stomach ) and aci@@ dic sensation .
in patients with persistent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it must not be applied to diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can &apos;t stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or feed of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day .
the following not@@ ices are to be followed in order to reduce the risk of cereb@@ ral irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place prior to the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor therefore ought to refer atten@@ tively to all the signs and symptoms that are pointed to potential bre@@ aching reactions like dy@@ nasty , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ ly pain or retro@@ sp@@ inal so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of heavier side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not use the medicine correctly , and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions are given to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large quantities of clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was observed , rare ( after the market launch ) mag@@ nit@@ ures and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to give information , whether the cancellation of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ al therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the ja@@ w .
the clinical assessment due to treat@@ able doctor is crucial for treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients are supposed to have to rely on the dose of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their failure .
they should not take two tablets a day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week day .
other diseases affected the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , the patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of ordinary pharmac@@ euticals , without clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable in pregnancy , nor during pregnancy .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the ja@@ w was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also reported oste@@ opor@@ osis .

fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo@@ arding trials where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily ) were taken either by either 1 or 2 years old .
in this study the daily gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at decreased the occurr@@ ence of at least one new verteb@@ rates by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % compared to Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who transplan@@ ts a kidney or liver in order to prevent the transplan@@ ting of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer can already be used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer and data from published literature .
furthermore , results of a clinical study on 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t were presented , the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Progra@@ mmer / Progra@@ mmer or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the primary inde@@ er of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ tation was suspended from one year ( by example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and examined , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer .
tre@@ ading ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rho@@ e ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hyper@@ ten@@ emia ) , blood pressure ( hyper@@ ten@@ emia ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with persistent hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , Macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially several herbal medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of simultaneously recorded drug may have to be adjusted accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the brigh@@ tly yellow capsule part with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule part with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should be done this drug or add changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ tation or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or transi@@ tional supp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ o @-@ formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or the regim@@ es should only be performed under the close control of one in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based on clinical assessment of abor@@ tion and toler@@ ability in regard to blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; recommendations )
after conversion from Progra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f you should check the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ spiegel in front of the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as the valley level , was comparable to both types of kidney disease as well as in transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the patient is not allowed in the first postoperative phase no oral medicine treatment can be administered intraven@@ ous ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application on the supp@@ ression of the transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum length of oral therapy can not be specified .
dosage recommendations : kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ kling the patient can change after implant@@ ation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations : liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Progra@@ f on Adv@@ agra@@ f is a gra@@ ft receive twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f . this change@@ over in relation to a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose , to be done .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ som@@ ed@@ si@@ va on Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day must begin treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ t recommended oral dosage for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are switched on Adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral tablet dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day to be taken in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipient Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and mal@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with breast canc@@ ers in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the maintenance of bleeding in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions as a replacement of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ tics , it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum ) is recommended to calculate the creation of the creation and monitoring of the urine volume ) .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f with the change@@ over of a c@@ ic@@ los@@ o @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level mirror in whole blood . the dose should be based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ating and toler@@ ability in case of using full @-@ blood @-@ blood @-@ level controls .
it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Progra@@ me to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ung , modifications of immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy or while simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ kling blood circulation ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medic@@ inal product with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State is entered .
the data in clinical studies have to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels do not exceed the blood levels in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , tac@@ ular mirror in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
in general , blood concentrations in the range of liver , kidney and cardiac patients were usually used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft reactions or other side effects , which can appear in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Sub@@ - or Ex@@ pos@@ ure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ o @-@ formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of formulation or regim@@ es should only be performed under the close control of one in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which was proven to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ si@@ va as re@@ frac@@ tory , no clinical data are still available for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed wor@@ ding Adv@@ oc@@ f .
for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ tation with adult heart transplan@@ t and gra@@ dients in child age there are not any clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ant wor@@ ding Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible inter@@ actions which can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ular mirror in the blood and a decrease of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant remedi@@ es during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rhoea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ular concentrations in the blood is provided , as the tac@@ ular blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases it was known as car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called chamber @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which therefore can be found under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure and oils .
like with other immune soup , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to adequate clothing or use of a s@@ uns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take the Tac@@ tics , symptoms for pre@@ aches like headache , change consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
because Adv@@ agra@@ f is hard capsules , lact@@ ose , lact@@ ose , is very careful in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal products which are known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore reduce blood values of tac@@ ular lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore advis@@ able to monitor the tac@@ ular blood levels at the same age of substances that can change CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and provide the tac@@ ular dose to maintain the same concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was developed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , fluor@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre @-@ icon@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ id antibiot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the rise of blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to inhibit@@ ing gastro@@ intestinal distor@@ tion .
highly do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute abor@@ tion actions , can increase the concentration of tac@@ kling blood in the blood or lower .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ular drugs with medicines which can be metab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lowered the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cephal@@ ic and thus increase the hormone ex@@ position , is particularly careful in decisions about receiving contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ular lim@@ us can decrease the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and can extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that , among the tac@@ o climate compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ si@@ va , increased risk for undes@@ i@@ rable events relating to the course and the result of the pregnancy is .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns recommends at the potential of the harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated with progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ kel@@ etal therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant neo@@ oplas@@ ties including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tac@@ tile is not di@@ aly@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ ologically dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed to the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ eic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nu@@ cle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ oric shiel@@ ding inhibit@@ ing in T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ c@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice a day to other primary organ transplan@@ tations Progra@@ me has developed into a recognized primary immune soup into pancre@@ as , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 case @-@ out patients , in 4@@ 75 patients , were subjected to pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and used in 630 cases after a intestinal transplan@@ tation as primary immune soup .
in total , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ me in these published studies showed observations in the large studies where the program was applied to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent analysis conducted with oral Progra@@ me was reported about 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ ers in a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ ization .
chronic immun@@ o@@ transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was obl@@ iter@@ ated syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ climate and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in cases of patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was obl@@ iter@@ ated compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases to be converted from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were por@@ ted to C@@ ic@@ los@@ ers ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft injury after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) , and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the case of transplan@@ ting patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis was obl@@ iter@@ ated syn@@ dro@@ ms significantly lower with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients .
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study carried out at 205 patients who were simultaneously subjected to pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation , which received a random@@ ized procedure Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or c@@ ic@@ los@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ ation ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and after reaching the reb@@ ate level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric study with oral transplan@@ ts showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ inal transplan@@ tations ) among Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one a updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ gins , additional initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , lead to Tal@@ ks between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently acquired transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rats and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the dis@@ connected group of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the transplan@@ tation of higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this allows to conclude that the tac@@ ular climate is almost entirely metab@@ oli@@ zed - with the decision , mainly via the g@@ all .
in stable patients that were converted from Progra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than under Progra@@ f .
it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
21 In the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ si@@ va as therapies , no clinical data are available for ret@@ ardi@@ zed wor@@ ding Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid exposure and oils .

Adv@@ ances are used to treat bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one through the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ots ) .
dosage and frequency of the application is to be applied , if Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing bleeding problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles , or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method produced as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the human od@@ ine factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is produced in another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is different , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding , as well as surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate was awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ances may not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against the human od@@ or factor VIII , Maus@@ oleum or ham@@ ster protein or other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant approval for the transport of Adv@@ ances in the whole European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gel , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity cannot sink the same period under the given plasma seal ( in % of the standard or in fact / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment can be eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is over .
during treatment , the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions have an adequate determination of factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ cul@@ ate .
individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and feature different half @-@ value periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ is cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not gover@@ ned with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out .
the rate of administration is to be judged by the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation for the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ position days most of the largest and genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extru@@ sion and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic inhibit@@ ors was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the res@@ ale of ( lowest tri@@ ang@@ es ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s associated with A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which have been treated with previously untreated patients who have increased higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood co@@ ag@@ ulation was calculated during all the time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a lasting severe to moderate @-@ severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a patient to 26 conditions with A@@ DV@@ ATE an low inc@@ en@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pap@@ al patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with a severe chronic hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was determined by previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients of a running clinical study showed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins were analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Cho cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicate an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated from the appearance of Ur@@ tica , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased numbers of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ ocy@@ tes in several repeated product positions in the context of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE was reported regarding overclo@@ cking reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency is not known ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a factor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics with A@@ DV@@ ATE were carried out in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters originate from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed below the table 3 listed below .

based on the data processing available since the initial approval data , the CH@@ MP has further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but in considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored :
therefore CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates an application of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder will apply to another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Human@@ istic Sh@@ ush@@ agent ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company returns its application for approval by Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the crossover ( tissues , the other structures in the body connects , surro@@ unds and relies on ) are affected .
in doing so , it is a type of virus that has genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means that it cannot produce copies of itself , and therefore no infections can trigger for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 gene , which is made from the non @-@ defect in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is normally used to restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer area in the field of sub@@ structure , bone and brain .
after CH@@ MP had reviewed the answers of the company based on him , some questions were still un@@ explained .
based on the assessment of initially submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP has created 120 a list of questions that is sent to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been sufficient that injection by Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors have advantages for patients .
the committee also concerns the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company had not adequ@@ ately proved that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in touch with the patient , harmful .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP in knowledge whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ess swelling ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ gged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may cause the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms that were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients that Aer@@ in@@ aze had revenues , compared with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients receiving P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nose is viewed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ oco showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to the patients who have des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , mou@@ th@@ iness , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or ( lack of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pless ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ ensis may not be applied to patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze must not be applied to patients who suffer from a bott@@ ling angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , heart disease or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ o@@ osis ( hyper@@ pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ o@@ deficiency ( hypertension ) , or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company a approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ ers in the whole European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is in all the amount of swal@@ low ( i.e. , without broken down , break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used for children under 12 years due to failure and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dis@@ sound the symptoms .
it is advised to limit the application time to 10 days , since when long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can take off with time .
after decl@@ ining the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as a mono@@ therapies .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ tin , per@@ go@@ ose , Lis@@ ur@@ ide , h@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ at@@ tiv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ t@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ h@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data were not sufficient to pron@@ ounce respective recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ oco were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce respective recommendations to the dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ton@@ ic or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache , ampli@@ fication ) must be removed .
in the treatment of following patient groups , patient suffering is advised to be careful : • patients suffering from cancer patients with cardiovascular disease • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze has at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically important inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , no significant differences were detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo perceived regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was not identified yet , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is un@@ inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the un@@ think@@ ability of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , have no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the prevalence of normal population .
since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ que properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine should not be used in pregnancy .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of per@@ sist@@ ence or ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased intellectual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , com@@ a , cardiovascular coll@@ ation ) and a CN@@ S stimul@@ ation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) .

a CN@@ S stimul@@ ation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ ill@@ ary and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adh@@ es@@ ion molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose @-@ study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication , sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause any sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
we took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined using the total score for symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al ul@@ omet@@ ry ) , significantly higher than a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the ab@@ norm@@ ative effect , determined using the nas@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ess well@@ ung , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ oco tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is demon@@ stra@@ ble within 30 minutes following the administration of plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the weight @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ cop@@ ic study carried out with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects , has been found that four test subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin fain@@ ted out badly .
a component inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was the exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety , security mac@@ ology , for toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ productive data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , however , do not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than their individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in re@@ productive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and a rab@@ bit at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ g@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing , that hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , can un@@ fold its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lin@@ ens symptoms occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as ni@@ otic , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and so@@ aring eyes at the same time con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain conditions , you can be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous drug P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this drug .
( inf@@ ill ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to a nar@@ rowing of stomach , intest@@ ine or corn@@ ering ) , a buck@@ le cap , bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ men in the patient &apos;s history ( short@@ ness of a sei@@ z@@ ure of lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate size or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
inform your doctor if you are diagnosed with the following symptoms or disorders : • arter@@ ial hypertension • heart ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhyth@@ ms , nausea and headache , or an ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other drugs or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
traffic light and the use of machines in use at the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ aze conduc@@ ts or lowered your attention .
if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze , you should immediately notice your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze , If you forgot to take a dose just in time , take the application as soon as possible , and apply the next dose at the planned time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice effects that are not specified in this use information .
heart ch@@ ase , Rast@@ al , severe physical activity , mouth dry , dizziness , neck pain@@ s , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , ti@@ redness , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and drow@@ sin@@ ess .

following the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ st@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , til@@ ting and swelling ) or skin fail@@ ures are reported .
over cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , dys@@ functions , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , rec@@ el@@ essness with multiple physical activity , more than cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous liver values was also very rare .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged up to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , that is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or si@@ r@@ ens .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml syrup or si@@ r@@ ens .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by adju@@ sting the alter@@ ation of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of t@@ add@@ les , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) and after six weeks of treatment .
there were further studies submitted to prove that the body weight the syrup , solution to intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us increased from 25 to 32 % , compared with the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decline of symptoms after six weeks was compared with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe company an approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin with teenagers from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 &amp; 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out accordingly to the previous disease and can be termin@@ ated at the re@@ sound of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their return .
during the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the same period of po@@ uring .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened at the same time consuming A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the patients should be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ligh@@ test , that can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of per@@ plex@@ ity or ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently used side effects , which was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) and mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect headache , these were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and treated at 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose @-@ dose , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the adh@@ es@@ ion molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , was given no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in an individual dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication , sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ otic , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , cad@@ ence and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be classified as an alternative in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and per@@ s@@ isti@@ ble allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the questionnaire about the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduced the burden of allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology dis@@ regards the e@@ ti@@ ology at the different forms of similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited .
as the hist@@ amine release is a thou@@ ght@@ ful factor in all ancient illness , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin except during the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria also leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement of it@@ ching over 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax considerably , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in an pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients &quot; Dem@@ ograph@@ s &quot; were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no obligation for a clinical relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet , so interaction with other drugs did not be excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 drug is un@@ inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty foods , cal@@ ory rich breakfast ) were not included in the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
the clinical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin who exhibited in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and from Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies on security mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeat@@ ability , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and reproductive par@@ ity leave the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no particular haz@@ ards for human beings .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the dup@@ lication doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest that treatment of a infectious rhin@@ itis containing A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory lessons or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis should play a role in diagnosis , physical studies and appropriate laboratory and skin studies .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ st@@ anz@@ ee ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up for children between 2 and 11 years , which is restricted - is identical to the children that are normal metab@@ oli@@ ze .
this drug contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with severe problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suff@@ iciency did not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not reinforced with the effects of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group like the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because of the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily has been applied for more than 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
clinical trials was detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults it did not affect the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to an ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced output equal to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis were A@@ eri@@ us tablets effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ otic , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ties and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
how was shown on the basis of the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , reduced A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective at the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of Qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
the prevalence of this affected metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ ine ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the syrup form@@ ul@@ ating in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which is restricted - observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4@@ times higher with an termin@@ ale of approximately 120 hours .
there are no obligation for a clinical @-@ relevant drug cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to the recommended doses of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III glass bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene connection folder with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
featuring a rigid , transparent pol@@ ysty@@ rene measuring spoon , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml , or with an application @-@ injection for preparations for inser@@ ts of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate take once daily in the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not found in clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were used in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clinical relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory tests , medical examinations , vital marks and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily has been used daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose @-@ study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication , sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are associated with flying .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee on Human@@ istic Sh@@ ush@@ agent ( CH@@ MP ) committee that the company returns its application to prevention of avi@@ era H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect flu , caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza @-@ A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a strain of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears to be dis@@ semin@@ ate by humans , because humans have not built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and is antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a flu virus to create this ancest@@ or faster antibody .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects human body as body @-@ foreign ) , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study sites demonstrated that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of clinical data base was not enough to evaluate the requirements of the vaccine security guidelines in order to comply with the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you want more information regarding the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for treating adults and children over four years working with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , asp@@ ir@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but these cannot be taken together with k@@ j@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ vent@@ ase should only be ordained if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drugs of the patient previously , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood assessed that the virus is getting on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ tic@@ ase is intended for body weight .
A@@ vent@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not able to cure , however , the damage of the immune system and thereby del@@ aying the development of AIDS related infections and disorders .
it@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , however , without chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , previously not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases .
this with low do@@ si@@ k@@ avi@@ r reinforced medic@@ inal medic@@ inal drug was taken at 206 adults who had taken earlier prot@@ e@@ at@@ hood , compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases .
main indi@@ ces for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in blood ( vir@@ us@@ load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken any prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo but A@@ vent@@ ase had less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , chor@@ us also reduced the vir@@ us@@ last , but with the children who used to have been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ eds only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases that were treated with prot@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ vent@@ ase the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ ors :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ or , there came under A@@ vent@@ ase along with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r on a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks as well as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ esters :
the most common adverse reactions ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r or other components .
A@@ vent@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medic@@ inal products , which are min@@ ed as v@@ ast@@ ase , and in high concentrations in blood are harmful .
as in other medicines for HIV , the risk of a cereb@@ ro@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extinction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the recovery immune system ) .
at the end , the Committee on Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of respiratory drugs in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years opposed to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ lif@@ iers k@@ j@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of A@@ vent@@ u@@ ase in combination with k@@ j@@ avi@@ r in patients who had no prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ or did not have been detected .
A@@ vent@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since it was only limited to approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted an approval to the domestic policy of A@@ vent@@ o in the whole European Union .
A@@ vent@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , protein inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
am@@ per@@ ase capsules are usually supposed to be administered together with low doses of k@@ ett@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ ett@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral resist@@ ors and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is about 14 % lower than of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , asp@@ ir@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for asp@@ ir@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ ling ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ tic@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) .
the recommended dose for asp@@ ir@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ tic@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases were not examined in children .
it@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to failure to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , an adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ vent@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , cur@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain , may not be used due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r during ing@@ es@@ tion of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ vent@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with am@@ per@@ v@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , asp@@ ir@@ ase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver problems with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of Hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information for this drug .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver operation under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ vent@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ y@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , which are changed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible use of treatment of the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ oi@@ esis effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ni@@ otic function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of my@@ op@@ la@@ z@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are methods for determining the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , am@@ per@@ v@@ ase can be less effective because of am@@ b@@ ill@@ ings ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cephal@@ itis can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to be able to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium pul@@ ch@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ ation content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups .
aper@@ ture should be set to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ ors , was reported on the onset of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ hal@@ ation of existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with metabolic disorders , associated with metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , who were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases , reports about an increase of bleeding , including spon@@ tan@@ ces hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of the drug may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with small therapeutic width of k@@ cavi@@ ar may not be combined with drugs whose substances are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , and are connected to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance class .
in an attempt to eliminate the hum@@ ility of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ bled by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient already accepts St John &apos;s wort , am@@ id@@ av@@ al levels are and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ load and dep@@ ose the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose of dose for one of the drug is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also vanity below ) .
508 % increase , if C@@ max is decreased by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and in@@ sist@@ ence of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
if Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ j@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) was given .
the C@@ min values of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day at the combination of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg cavi@@ ar cavi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended not to be eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ige monitoring since the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ tic@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acid below ) .
therefore , in combination of E@@ stra@@ r in combination with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ ett@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose to be required .
the treatment with E@@ stra@@ r in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ und and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used at the same time , caution is advis@@ able , since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma concentration .
if this drug is used together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision should be made , since an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ j@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ b@@ abo@@ und and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ ration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin caused by 193 % and thus a rise of adverse events related to Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is required to ab@@ stain@@ ed together with am@@ big@@ u@@ tin , at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ vent@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin was not performed , but could be increased the plasma seal of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of 700 mg of fossil @-@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ m ) to 2,@@ 69@@ m once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ ett@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used if they are applied to inter@@ actions , possibly inter@@ actions .
the patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ tic@@ asis .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can result in res@@ or@@ tive disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , c@@ odi@@ pin , and di@@ pin pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake of as@@ tic@@ ase can considerably increase the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ zent@@ or@@ ations and enhance the side effects of P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) was significantly increased when endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ a with k@@ j@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible use of treatment of treatment of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ oi@@ osis ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are distinctive increases of the plasma seal at the same time .
since plasma welding increases these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hu@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
there will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors , since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ular lim@@ us can be increased by am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
thus , am@@ per@@ v@@ ase may not be applied along with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the respiratory application is provided with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ rot@@ ors indicate a possible rise in the plasma seal of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- up to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium pul@@ ch@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ es , no recommendation can be given , as Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
at the same time of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ces together with the respiratory system , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) is recommended for the possibility of reducing or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cephal@@ itis is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pra@@ min and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time of respiratory treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used for the mother &apos;s possible use during pregnancy in pregnancy by means of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks .
in the milk lact@@ ating rats , am@@ b@@ abo@@ und related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r survived in people into breast milk .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ b@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the stagn@@ ation of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the stagn@@ ation .
further development of demand , including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ productive capability , was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r on the parent .
the un@@ think@@ ability of A@@ vent@@ ase has been studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ uni@@ ase treatment were mild to moderately pronounced , occurred early and led rarely to the treatment plant .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in relation to the treatment of A@@ vent@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the gras@@ shop@@ per .
most of the above @-@ mentioned adverse events are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ ases were not treated twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , who were listed below the examination as in connection with the study drug , were listed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as the treatment @-@ saving laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fa@@ wn fat tissue , prolifer@@ ate fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ al fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ern@@ ers ) .
at 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral do not pre @-@ treated persons who had been treated with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a median duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ers ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study , PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 was found at 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ER in pre @-@ treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were usually mild to moderately pronounced , ery@@ thema or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment had to be abor@@ ted .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disorder or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opport@@ un@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ ware twice a day along with low do@@ si@@ zed k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which received under sole asp@@ ir@@ ase treatment ; an exception of the tri@@ glyc@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ vent@@ ase together with low do@@ si@@ zed k@@ j@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent .
in case of overdose , the patient is observed at signs of a toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both at acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r is found in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells .
the connection between activity of am@@ per@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human being is not defined yet .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently registered Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other k@@ cavi@@ ar treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ rot@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure could be studied until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , with which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 included , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adult .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg ) , treated patients with protein inhibit@@ ors were treated with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ inhibit@@ ors mut@@ ations on :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analyses of Gen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations can be used for evaluation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ ett@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resist@@ ence as the presence of mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I / C / W / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a reduced phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resist@@ ence ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is advised to attract current interaction systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ tested analyses of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ oning systems may be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
firms which distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpre@@ t results of a resistance tests .
each of these four counts with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated patterns creates a certain cr@@ us@@ ement against k@@ j@@ avi@@ r , sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ure@@ ters for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ or , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients ( one of which , a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ce@@ inhibit@@ ors of isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a reconc@@ iling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which may affect the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ vent@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open trial ( 600 mg twice a day ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest k@@ ett@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ vent@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub balance of AP@@ V / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r as opposed to the So@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ flow wave of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of inde@@ b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ed A@@ vent@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was administered three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low do@@ si@@ z@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children who are expected to be considered &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ed &quot; A@@ vent@@ ase . &quot;
after oral dos@@ ing the average duration ( max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for one capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , if C@@ max is lowered by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered together with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) .
the administration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the mag@@ nit@@ ude and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg on a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows to close a large distribution volume , as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in total concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active stock@@ ings remained constant throughout the course of the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore we need to in@@ duce the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tive or inhi@@ bit the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strate , with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of respiratory capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice a day .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is from solution 14 % less bi@@ odegra@@ dable than from capsules ; therefore , asp@@ ir@@ ase solution and respiratory capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al dys@@ functional disorders is likely to be low .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma welding , similar to those who are obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ per@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular Aden@@ ome at dos@@ ages caused by 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ oma and carcin@@ omas has not been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans are un@@ clear .
from the relevant exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little clu@@ es for the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings occurred .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests , micro @-@ core test in rats and chromosome aber@@ ration tests on human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ abo@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity may be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during administration of the treatment still after the end of treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in the controls as well as with am@@ b@@ avi@@ r animals .
in a systematic plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose at humans , however , a number of small changes including thy@@ mus ton@@ ation and mar@@ gin@@ ally skel@@ etal changes were observed in a delayed development .
24 If as@@ tic@@ ase capsules are applied without the enh@@ ancing addition of k@@ j@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ ster@@ ling ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ tic@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for asp@@ ir@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg am@@ b@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ alised ratio ) , are methods for determining the drug concentration .
aper@@ ture should be set to 27 times when an rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders .

a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended not to be eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ige monitoring since the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ stra@@ r in combination with am@@ b@@ abo@@ und and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both protein inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if this drug is used together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical supervision should be made , since an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ b@@ abo@@ r and k@@ j@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .

in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , the systemic treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od had been detected in the systemic treatment of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines .
in 3 appro@@ vals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete trigger of the case of the case for an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is much superior .
in 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od untreated patients , this was a case of 20 % of the 105 associated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) .
a complete press release could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five @-@ time application a week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumor were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study showed that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and stayed for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of regular use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically superior , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ comp@@ lies within a connected 25 c@@ m2 body area than on the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face .
results from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) from two combined monitoring studies .
the approved indications of expression , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients normally and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Con@@ tag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies at the examined dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks )
a minimum systemic absorption of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose has been observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were measured in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the estimated half @-@ life period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od had low effect on MC @-@ diagnosed skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super @-@ cell@@ ist bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the paint toxic@@ ity in the rat no . 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; one also carried out for four months on the paint appli@@ que has no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during oral administration at three days a week induced no tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk of people due to systematic exposure is very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice , treated with the effective free cream , previously and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms have significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice effects that are not specified in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied for the patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gl@@ e , g@@ ags ) are not disman@@ tled , and therefore in most organs in the body and they are ashamed .
the following not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints that make the movements more difficult , dimin@@ ished pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ational tools , and the patients require appropriate drugs to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by increasing its effect in terms of reduction in the urine concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat treatment , fever and reactions to in@@ fusion .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who are highly sensitive to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year any new information that may be known , and if this summary is necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is receiving patients receiving Al@@ th@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. as approval to the office of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the whole European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Cho @-@ Mamm@@ alogy @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased when the patient we@@ ars up to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h every 15 minutes .
safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any correlation between in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also be monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are now available .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , almost all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase constitute , usually within 3 months of treatment start .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , risks must be cau@@ tious due to a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction due to the theoretical risk reaction .
60 minutes before the start of the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be sc@@ aled and / or reducing the in@@ fusion rate for half of the in@@ fusion rate which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be weak@@ ened .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate which occurred the previous reaction .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me shouldn &apos;t be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is exposed to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase about the breast milk , it is recommended to not breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects of clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which have been observed during the phase 3 study and extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs were beyond heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ ase asmus , breathing and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug @-@ effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe contamination and treatment duration of up to 12 months have been reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a serum version , whereas in the patients at the age of 5 years with a severe contamination form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early departure from the study ) were observed in 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ repar@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients suffering from low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n , whereas in patients with high antibody detection , a variable reduction of g@@ ag was observed in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to small neutr@@ alizing effect on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ oni@@ als activity in vitro that appeared not to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ i@@ red medicine reactions , although the occurr@@ ence of adverse reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzymes of the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and preventing a further accumulation of en@@ cyclo@@ ec@@ tivity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of the patients had been recruited from the mean phen@@ otype , and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients have been recruited if they had a trained exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated with the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to see in the following table .
in the open extension study , improved and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the acceptance of the expected pro@@ cent@@ u@@ al FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period , and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further proportional to body size growing children .
of the 26 patients with h@@ ep@@ nuclear treatment in the treatment of 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Cre@@ at@@ inine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease of disease between the patients receiving a combined final variable ( expected normal FE@@ V , range in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of shoulder @-@ joint AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with middle circulation ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z score for this age group . the younger patients with severe contamination form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean patients with severe contamination form were limited , limited , or no progress in cog@@ nitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out to pharmac@@ ologically dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Do@@ si@@ zation schem@@ ata to the g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be patient who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a justi@@ fiable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent to .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on security mac@@ ro@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity at repeated gift and reproductive par@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data will not recognize any special dangers for human beings .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) , which can not be removed without any chemotherapy alone , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant cancer ) is probably easily spread to other parts of the body . • more advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that is not affected by the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who had previously not treated , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously used other chemical therapies , as always used for some therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin B12 ) .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should also be given an &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tical &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed up , removed or reduced the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to stat@@ ure in cancer cells , leading to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer active effect in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ icious Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ el@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.3 months compared to Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months compared to 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epi@@ theli@@ al cells , at the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the medicine medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. as a approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole European Union .
each bottle containing 4.2 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) must be dissolved , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for overwhelming hard@@ ship epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small cell bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion about a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken , and intake must be continued during the entire treatment period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients also have to receive intra@@ muscular injection vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as in any third upgrade cycle .
in patients who received p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood sample should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te tale .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose check will take place under the approval of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood flow or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
following the recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therapies or in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient treatment before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients to 2 can cure or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ atology Tox@@ ic@@ ity 3 or 4 or so on during the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased by @-@ effect is increased .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data on the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need any dose adjustments that go beyond the recommended Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations for all patients .
the data base in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ inine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ asis ) are not specifically investigated in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ ker and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed could not be administered to patients , before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation count increased again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te count once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ aid numbers , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and non@@ woven toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutr@@ rop@@ enia was observed if a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients have to rely on to use P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous activation of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , treatment and min@@ des@@ - after 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for therapy with pup@@ il re@@ mixed , must avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time value for at least 5 days before the therapy , treatment and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the onset of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid @-@ accumulation in trans@@ cellular space is required a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the treatment of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of reproductive ability exists by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn insi@@ sted on advice regarding sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ ster@@ il@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed position with the result of a prolifer@@ ating effect of side effects .
therefore beware if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , treatment and min@@ des@@ - had avoided 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the acquisition will be present with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long sem@@ inal value , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , treatment and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - can be avoided .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status as the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ces and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy requires increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless necessarily , demanding and after careful defense of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible cran@@ ial of the reproductive ability exists by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment , advice on the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vi@@ e- blocking .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received testing medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement of the clinical relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ al Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ el@@ om has been shown in the use of lung cancer treatment in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pla@@ yo@@ tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function in the time of the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival effect fell to benefit from AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a mainly hard@@ disc epi@@ theli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study demonstrated that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ under@@ balance of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .

it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie di@@ ligent diet .
patients who take all@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks should turn to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
these enzymes become inhi@@ bited , they can not reduce the fats in the diet , making such a quarter of the fats un@@ paved the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , all patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 was compared to placebo .
in the two studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who posted all@@ i 60 mg per year , an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study involving all@@ i in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at After , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movements , chair @-@ numbers , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering sh@@ ew@@ ays ( winds ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .

the probability of occurr@@ ence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich national meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be taken with an improved metabolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adjusted .
patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicine for hypertension or an elevated Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dos@@ ing of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is advised to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent serious diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) in the case of severe diar@@ rhoea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug @-@ effects of pharmac@@ euticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma seal was observed .
when application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ces in combination with or@@ list@@ at could be influenced by the Quick values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins in the standard range remained .
however , to take the patient recommended , before bed@@ time a supplem@@ ental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin was to be taken to ensure a sufficient vital intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single @-@ one dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one a limited number of healthy volunteers was observed at the same time or@@ list@@ at , a small decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and imp@@ lies with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the number of people is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ able ) .
the prevalence of known side effects , which were detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported from a population un@@ certain@@ ed .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i to def@@ at@@ titudes may lead to potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects , without having significant clinical findings occurred .
during the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on humans and animal can be derived from a rapid recovery of systematic systematic effects , due to the li@@ gible properties of or@@ list@@ at .

two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ zation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol tot@@ aled 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

overweight has influence on your health and increases the risk of emergence of various serious diseases such as : • arter@@ ial hypertension • diabetes • heart disease • oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk for this disease .
a permanent weight loss , for example , by improving the diet and more movement , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals which contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn after and gradually feed permanently .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ oule , which you can also find an indication on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories should take a maximum of calories per day .
note that below in this section called tables . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what quantity is suitable for you , take the below information which indicates the number of calories which is suitable for you . • Cl@@ ement to the mode of mode is crucial to comply with the recommended fat intake .
if you take the same amount of fat as hi@@ ther@@ to , this can mean that your body can not process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and decrease the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood for mal@@ icious initi@@ ations . • You should try to gradually increase gradually .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose about 0.5 kg per week , without any fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Straight physical activity &quot; means that you burn only little or not to go stairs , in the garden work or other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn about 150 kcal per day , for example through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ ory and fat targets and hold them . • To make sense a food supplement with information about cal@@ ory and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .

alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( such as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as for chem@@ o@@ therapies ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal product that can be used as an anti @-@ medication ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not have enough information .
this means that the substance the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy treatment , which are strong resp@@ ecting nausea and vomiting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of the patients with alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vomiting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with on@@ el@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy treatment , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy had no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with on@@ el@@ et@@ ron treated patients ( 127 from 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted an approval to the company , Helsinki , Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , an approval for the office of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi on prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can leng@@ then the col@@ on stream , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ b@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is enjo@@ ined by using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines containing the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend towards such an extension .
in the connection with a further chemical therapeu@@ tics gift , alo@@ xi is not used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron does not prevent the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , dos@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ i and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ological interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady equi@@ val@@ or concentration of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ e@@ ti@@ din , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience to the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at Human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be treated by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) observed at least possibly with alo@@ xi related cases , headache ( 9 % ) and fruit p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of survival reactions and reactions at the appointment ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar skins can be seen from adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose of re@@ active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective treatment at a alo@@ xi@@ de over@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 500@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) received treatment to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ e.@@ intraven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ chemotherapy was summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block an ion channels at vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation , and extend the duration of the shareholder .
the aim of the study of 221 healthy volunteers were evaluated in the evaluation of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of I.@@ V. dos@@ ing Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma cent@@ ration an slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ology of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma percentage ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally generally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg in patients and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after an intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses of 3 doses of patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 measured ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma cent@@ ration at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total ex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) comparable to one intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after one @-@ time of 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabolism , which are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 ( CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 ) are involved in the metabolism of the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were recovered about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changing drug made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function cases the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al end@@ age and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , only following ex@@ positions were observed , which are considered sufficient to determine the maximum of human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical trials showed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular rate and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation , and can extend the s@@ wap rate .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ) spoke in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ative frequency of liver tumor , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ as , ad@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and because alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , relevance of these results is minimal .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report on the approval of the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon was supposed to be a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ an ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Sub@@ stances &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic hepatitis C ( a viral infection ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , besides , the values of the liver enzy@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data which prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of medication , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference case by 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , how many patients were treated according to 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have been told that data on stability of the drug and the market @-@ market drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease increases more patients with more patients than the reference case ; moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
aside from that , in the study , the test was promp@@ ted to investigate the question , to what extent the medication is a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a nar@@ rative formation incoming skin infection ) and small infected military jun@@ ctions ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting ) , incl@@ ination and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because alarm against this kind of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the surface area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient is not add@@ ressing the treatment for two or three days , the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works through blocking of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ ces of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was delayed after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated under placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ dogs Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates were considered : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated for treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is caused by the treatment of excav@@ ation ( eit@@ er@@ filled hol@@ low areas in body tissue ) or of infections , which have been caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human@@ istic Cra@@ cker ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go on short @-@ time treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections are conce@@ aled against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ z@@ ations , bru@@ ising or se@@ wn wounds .
the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for the office of Al@@ tar@@ go in the whole European Union in May 2007 .
patients with which no improvement appear within two to three days should still be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the Sal@@ be carefully wi@@ g@@ out and an adequate alternative therapy of infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a path@@ ogen ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in secondary infected wounds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin for@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place will occur .
the effects of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved when people after top@@ ical use were achieved on the poor skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , a clinical @-@ relevant in@@ hibition is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
3 Accord@@ ing to the simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the minor systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations are not used for treatment , when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive medicine after oral taking and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement about the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin of the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continued / ends or termin@@ ate the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is continued , it is to take place between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most often reported by exposure of irrit@@ ation at the passage that about 1 % of the patients entered .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ vative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre .
through binding on this binding point P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ tide , block partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ers .
should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms , a consultation by experts should be targeted .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to be considered in the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ val@@ ent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was brought up daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and in@@ till@@ ated skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 of adult patients each before the median and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic treatment in person according to top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 of the desired skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .

in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) that were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

there wasn &apos;t any male enhancement of reduced fertility associated with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which allows for up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) of the desired skin :

ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient is used as part of a two doses of the vaccine , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , the ambient temperature may only be used , if the immune system is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , which can be taken out of two doses of an in@@ oc@@ it@@ iner@@ ary .
if a re@@ frac@@ tive dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vaccines have effect by turning the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense of the body ) , &quot; how to defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix also contains the same components , as the previously approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and the vaccine ever approved since 1997 .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of a three doses of the vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are contained identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two injec@@ tions .
ambi@@ an resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degrees of the protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injec@@ tor , redness , p@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who are possibly exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . an approval for the office of the office of Ambi@@ rix in the entire country
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is to be given at the date of choice and the second dose for six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a sum@@ mons can be vacc@@ inated both for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B , may be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines or combination of hepatitis B .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies observed in the same size as according to vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ ity people who have addressed to a hepatitis B vaccine that may require a short@@ fall of protection because they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory through the immun@@ ological memory .
3 How with all injection systems should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended to contain 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of ha@@ em@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody is reached , so in these cases the gift of other in@@ oc@@ curren@@ ces can be required .
because intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration may result in the glut@@ eal muscles to a sub@@ optimal pulse success , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
at th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception as it can occur following intra@@ muscular administration to bleeding in these cases .
when ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis , and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza , was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ kel@@ etal therapy or patients with immune defect must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ uring , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever similar with the incidence that was observed with the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ e- and preser@@ vative @-@ containing vaccines form@@ ul@@ ating .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations in the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ures at a calculation base per vaccination dose ambient ambient , but not at a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination .
according to the entire vaccine cycle 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , over 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects who had vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose of combination .
however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable high ( i.e. , above all the vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix were compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and pain@@ fulness was small and comparable to the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination of 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparison study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccination records , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general re@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
however , with the 6- to 11@@ - year old vaccination with ambient is a frequent occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not reported per ann@@ ot@@ ape .
the share of vaccines caused by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination schem@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statistically significant .
in clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 ab@@ used dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 ab@@ used dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination pad with three doses .
among the 289 persons , whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was compens@@ ated , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 to the gift of the 3 dose of dose . it was significantly higher than Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response shown in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ olds to termin@@ ate a month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vaccination received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in 0 @-@ 6 months of in@@ oc@@ ul@@ ema .
the immune reaction to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens against both anti@@ gens , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are comparable to 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ inations similar to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in water contaminated waters .
they can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may potentially make a stationary treatment .
as with all the vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect completely from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ inations are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( though you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or feel sick / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent any disease .
a protection against other infections , which are toxic or symptoms , which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
allergic reaction can cause irrit@@ ating skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • If with you / your child has occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to prevent a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the use of the second vaccination dose ) .
if there is a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine , the physician will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine by a reduced content of hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components will usually be given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with serious blood cl@@ ots , inj@@ ected under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / his body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child are under@@ going a hem@@ line analysis .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can be in@@ adequate , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Make your doctor if you / your child will take another medicine ( including those who can have been vacc@@ inated without wear ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / was administered or imm@@ or@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or if you have been planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible as possible .
when ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will be enough .
normally , Ambi@@ rix is not administered or lact@@ ating women unless it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , you will talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dil@@ ated doses ) : • pain or complaints at the inser@@ tion or redness • redness • headache • lack of lack of lack of function
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injec@@ tor • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
other side effects , the days or weeks after the vaccination with a comparable combination of hepatitis A and Hepatitis B were very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 contaminated doses ) are :
these include local limited or extended sc@@ ul@@ ls , can be cra@@ mmed or les@@ ions , swelling of the eyes and face , sc@@ rub@@ ber@@ y or swal@@ low , sudden blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice effects that are not included in this package .
ambi@@ rix is available in packs 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs with 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the office , the CH@@ MP declare that the benefit of the benefit ratio is positive for Ambi@@ rix .
however , it was only limited to a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient ex@@ position .
ammon@@ ia may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain injury due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
ammon@@ ia is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , mixed with the food or over a gastro@@ ast@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach @-@ blanket in the gastro@@ intestinal tube ) or an nas@@ al probe ( through the nose in the gastro@@ intestinal tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because ammon@@ ia did not be compared to any treatment or with placebo ( an anti @-@ drug medicine , i.e. , without the drug ) .
ammon@@ ia may also contribute to loss of loss , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid form , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
in the end , the Committee on Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ia is effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea @-@ cycle .
ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this drug .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifest@@ ed in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ proof form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) there is an indication of the use when angi@@ ogen@@ esis is hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for babies , children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ous disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in granite .
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with gor@@ ous disorders , as a risk for the emergence of est@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately entering the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 grams ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ qui@@ ver heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and o@@ ede@@ tion in previous clinical conditions .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is carried out on the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and to a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed maturity of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is eliminated during the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of the patients had at least an undes@@ i@@ red event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that it was not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ rec@@ tic patient who developed an metabolic rate in combination with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
in a case of an overdose , an average single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) occurred with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 months .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which showed an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ tive neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is an internationally active link which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ gated through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ ecting , and the disease resulted in treating per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogy within the first year of life to death .
due to hem@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds ( So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to increase diagnosed disorders to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and were treated already before the first occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with the time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logic defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ proof form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a diet reduced , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are already ir@@ reversible , and in some cases , further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic , which is con@@ ju@@ ked in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were tested according to a single dose of 5 grams sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in sober healthy adults and patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also examined with cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma @-@ supply of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat was determined .
in the majority of patients with u@@ rea cy@@ c@@ ination or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster disorders ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic in plasma was det@@ ectable in plasma .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentrations of the third day is five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is eliminated in 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules will be taken either oral ( babies and children who do not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via a lo@@ ast@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ ke or an nas@@ al son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum prot@@ esters in plasma should be held within the normal range .
patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 grams ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat orders were exposed to Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , there came to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the c@@ ort@@ ex cells .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old ano@@ rec@@ tic patient who developed an metabolic rate in combination with lact@@ ate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess liquid
based on investigations on the evaluation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that each gram captured sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are already ir@@ reversible , and in some cases , further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after taking the plasma @-@ supply of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat have been found .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the final product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of less than 25 ° C .
the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8,6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dis@@ b@@ anded before use in water ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ it@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot leave the sti@@ cky waste products , which cannot leave after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the findings of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other drugs or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding you can &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may survive in breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disorders , after@@ math of the body , des@@ cal@@ enti@@ re@@ ty , memory defic@@ its and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , you feel immediately with your doctor or the emergency of your hospital in connection with the introduction of a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , un@@ pleasant skin irrit@@ ation , skin rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal lab values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice effects that are not specified in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the expi@@ ration order and the containers after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use no longer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expi@@ ration date . &quot; &quot; &quot;

angi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attacks to help maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and GP@@ I .
during the PCI was often a static ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and additionally they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI was angi@@ ox in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ ine , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be excessive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
it may not be applied to patients who recently had bleeding , as well as for people with heavy blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or heart infection .
at the end the Committee on Human@@ itarian Relief ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ ine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . an approval for the domestic policy of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
to treat adult patients with acute correlation of cor@@ on@@ ar@@ sis ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST ) up@@ market inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) during an emergency treatment or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in another sequence a PCI is given an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion of the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
according to the PCI board , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if it is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , a second bolt should be reduced to 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the bolt dose rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts to over 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( if with Bi@@ val@@ an ud@@ in against ACS is treated or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt .
in patients with severe kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in the approval , the ACT was worth 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or a other component or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood disorders due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ ag@@ ulation . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
the patients are carefully monitoring symptoms and signs of bleeding in terms of symptoms and signs of blood , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ine , most bleeding occur in the arter@@ ial point , patients who under@@ go to a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) occurs during the treatment principle everywhere .
in patients who are taken to war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ alised rates ) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in once again reached the existing level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ ces ( Hep@@ ar@@ ine , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ation@@ - ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , teenagers and children from six years with diabetes , which require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , inj@@ ected th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin does not handle insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter working time has a short @-@ effective human@@ oid .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ ces for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glyco@@ lic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at insulin l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % compared to normal normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who are possibly exagger@@ ated ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the A@@ pi@@ dra cans may need to be adapted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can influence the blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to provide a approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the stomach ceiling , to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal de@@ cks .
due to the dimin@@ ished glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin variation , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change in actual effect , the mark ( her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin requirements .
3 A in@@ adequate dosage or demo@@ li@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin any other manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required .
the timing of an hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is dependent on the re@@ working profile of the insulin profile and can therefore change when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase the blood@@ shed activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ e@@ tin , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxi@@ d@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ fy@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , sal@@ ic@@ y@@ ol@@ ates and sulph@@ on@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic oly@@ tics such as bed loos@@ ening , cl@@ oni@@ dine , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen res@@ ins are weak@@ ened or absent .
animal experimental studies on Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences in relation to pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ses occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin occurs neither in breast milk , nor is absorbed after oral application .
listed below are the clinical trials in accordance with the incidence of their occurr@@ ence ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the availability of the contents ( not inv@@ al@@ able ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y is failed to change the injec@@ tor within the stream of injec@@ tions , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y can occur at the injec@@ tor .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be treated with a intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ ing look@@ in , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating periph@@ eral glucose ( in particular by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ - be removed from insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effici@@ encies , and the actual duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in therapeu@@ tically relevant dos@@ ing area of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional absor@@ bing glucose effect , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a lower glucose increase in the glucose effect .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response effects like normal human insulin and achieves a full glucose effect for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data was obvious that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ den@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with a normal normal insulin that is 30 minutes before the meal .
in 2 minutes before the meal , is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ is@@ cated in 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved a better post @-@ den@@ ial control than with the normal normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal .
if is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ is turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human normal insulin is given ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at the age of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before ) before the start of the meal was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin that was 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal was given ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - afterwards ) after the onset of the meal compared to human nor@@ ms , which was 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
