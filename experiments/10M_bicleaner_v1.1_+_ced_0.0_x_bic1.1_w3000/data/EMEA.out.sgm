<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) is assessed by the study to provide recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your illness or treatment, please read the package block (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirls and speaking, hallucinations (listening or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic condition, alternating the patients lack of periods (periods of abnormal high spirits), alternating periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat medium to severe manic episodes and to prophetic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of striped restlessness or behavioural disorders, when the oral medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution enables to intake or the melt tablets in patients, which prepare the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients receiving other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be reduced to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Presumably, Aripiprazol seems to be described as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripiprazole, like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or some symptoms and will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered in increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was diagnosed on twelve weeks of 347 patients suffering from Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which have been stabilised with Abilify in which the various symptoms were stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was administered in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from modestine agitation, which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of patients suffering from a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led out studies in order to investigate how the body readily absorbs the melting tablets and the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for treating the bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of some more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented from up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo which resemble manic episodes at previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify-injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsy (drowsiness), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), stomach-hypersecretion (increased memory), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Evidence Committee (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify was at the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole led to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee met the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of striped anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a approval for the transport of Abilify in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a constant dose of 15 mg / day a day independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower Initial dose should be considered when clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithmebenzene dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to mental disorders and affective disturbances and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased suicidal risk with Arias opposed to other antipsychotics compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, malfunction disturbances), cerebrovascular disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reducing medicines) or hypertension (including accreditor and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials published a year or less, there were occasional reports on during treatment with Aripiprazene.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in one with ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms that signifies on a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be applied in patients with seizures in Anamnese or at intervals related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole associated with psychoses who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, increased risk of dying from placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study involving fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania, the application of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as a side effect is known, respectively, and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazene is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is regarded as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism can cause the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazene in comparison to CYP2D6 extensively.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as iso-conazole and HIV proteasrotors, should probably have similar effects and therefore, similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosishbone at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase of the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodological morphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of inadequate data security in humans and due to those in reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against, dangerous machinery, including power vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazene has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the specified side effects were defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and Dyskinesis were compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was diagnosed with a placebo treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients suffering from Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was diagnosed with opium treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazene, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse reactions that occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinous and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosities with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg were observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although, no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment in the treatment of a docking with Aripiprazole, however, it is unlikely that hemoralysis in the treatment of a docking of benefits is because Aripiprazene has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is communicated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as an excessive affinity for Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenches and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">At the gift of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the Positans-Tomography showed a dosing reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at cleaning.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled shortwage studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant more significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol controlled trial, 52 percent of the patient's share was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messralen, which were defined as secondary studio targets, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions-scale, showed a significant stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in response rate was observed in 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study involved in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients were involved in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapstudies with flexible application of 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed an superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapstudy about 3 weeks with a fixer dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed no superior efficacy against placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed superior to placebo within week 3 and a substantial effect that was comparable to lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazene also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania like lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapies with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazole in relation to the prevention of a bipolar return, primarily associated with prevention of a bipolar return.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyding of Aripiprazene, the N-Dealkyung is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbumzeit lies with almost 75 hours for Aripiprazole at extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic investigation, patients were not sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics yielded no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking to pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various mass liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw shots to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on security macology, toxicity in repeatability, reproductive oxicity, genotoxicity, and a canogeneous potential, the preclinical data had no special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when humans have exceeded, so they have limited or no significance for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects remotions a dosing-dependent secondary toxicity (AUC) in rats according to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the 3-10 times the middle Steady state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithither was found as a result of the failure of sulphate conjuicate of hydroxylic acid concentrations ranging from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended dose dose) of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg concentrations of sulfate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole not more than 6% of concentrations observed in the Galle of Monkeys, lie far below the marginal values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which lead to expositions of 3- and 11times of the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical average dose.</seg>

<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose of dose is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended to use for the use of children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because data are missing for discomfort and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since these patient population are only limited clinical experiences.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hypokalzaemia has sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid settling of the effect of Zoledronylic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary increase in the symptomatic hypokalzmia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily, at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal dysfunctions Zoledronic acid has been associated with kidney problems associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases referred to as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinine-Clearance (year prior to administration) and incidence of kidney failure, as well as a limited kidney function, were similar in a clinical study in osteoporosis for three years, comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of stock was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with acetsta patients compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory tests, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values found below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post-menopausal osteoporosis, in the study on avoiding clinical fractures after a hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an unchanged effect of three years, which resulted in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density at the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine at 6.7%, the total hips around 6.0%, the cord rose by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who were treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="628">A micro-computerized (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with acetsta's patients compared to placebo increasing the trasecular bone volume and preservation of the trasecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C-Telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum samples were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months, significantly reduced by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value until 36 months.</seg>

<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 i.e. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Impact on bone mineral density (BMD) In the Horizon-RFT study, the Accista treatment in the Horizon-RFT study increased the BMD as compared to placebo treatment and shrank pals for all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to placebo treatment over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% in total thaisons and at 4.3% on the shrank pals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon-RFT study, 508 men were randomized and at 185 patients, the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study involving males (study CZOL446M2308), the once-annual administration of acetsta in comparison to the procentric change in the Lendenwirbel-BMD was not inferior to 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radical confirming of the bone of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6fold up to 3,0fold age-specific normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to intake of 30 mg risedronat once a day during 2 months, was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">After 6 months of combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influenced compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as a responsive study at the end of the six months study (on the therapy had been addressed).</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was 141 of patients treated with risk provisioning, compared with 71 of patients treated with risk provisioning, in an average duration of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that as dosisindependently proved.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, plasma welding rose quickly from &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0,1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast biphonic disappearance of circulation cycle times t ½ to 0.24 and t 1 ½ to 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with an terminale Eliminationshalbumwerage t and ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned 2 ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption of the bones and the excretion on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the dose observed in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in Zoledroneous concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma percentage against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of through Cytochrome P450 enzyme - metabolic substances is improbable because Zoledronylic acid is not yet metabolized by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, fuel-dependent Inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with the Creatinine Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Creatinine Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This makes it possible that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and excessive kidney failure to down to a creatinine Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of ciedronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of heavy kidney failure (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data, these population are not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-eye-effective intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6multiple of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application has been administered as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that equals 6 times the human therapeutic exposure that corresponds to AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to).</seg>

<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated application was a proliferative primary Spongiosa in the metaphhyse of the long bones in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a result that reflected the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed teratogenicity at dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) deformations and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced in 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lowest serum-calcium mirror.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) is assessed by means to recommendations concerning the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not displayed. • It can be used together with another diabetic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to Metformin in Patients (in particular overweight patients) can be applied to metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose not satisfactorily.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonyl alcohol or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonyl alcohol or insulin can be maintained with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), except for patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar), or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be used in better and reduces blood sugar levels, making it better to adjust type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripleotherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl alcohol, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, concentration of a substance was measured in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which suggests that blood glucose levels have been lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripleotherapy study, the effect of the additional treatment of acetin and a sulphonylharnum in a lowering of HbA1c values increased by 0.94% while the additional treatment of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients were examined, the patients who undertook Actos in addition increased to decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, infections of upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos cannot be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketones).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that acetone should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients when metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited sent a permission to enter Actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white, circular, circular, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and in which metformin is inadequate (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered through presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone in combination with insulin is used.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports on cardiac insufficiency was revealed, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver function (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirrors can be increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, liver encoefficients are soon to control as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient developed symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, thatoppressive stress, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or darker Harn, are to verify the liver function of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon continued, should be led by the laboratory parameters from the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosing weight gain was detected, which can stir in fatty deposits and associated with a liquid form in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemoritacon, a low-level reduction in the medium hemoglobster values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under Metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematology (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who have Pioglitazone or triple combination therapy with insulin or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, ThiazolidIndions, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular demeanings a direct connection, but iment doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular deflection if patients are concerned about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic statement should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages undesired events, randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or enter this, the treatment is decreasing (see paragraph 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacologically dynamic of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporine, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reduction inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC from Pioglitazone to 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to that under treatment with pioglitazone decreased in the pregnancy, hypertenanemia and increased insulin resistance of breast cancers, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to the killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data is not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These result in a temporary change of the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege have emerged about three times the upper limit of the norm range as frequently as under Placebo but less frequently than in comparative groups under Metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw was higher than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rare above heart failure was reported under Pioglitazon, but more frequently when Pioglitazone in combination with insulin or patients with cardiac insufficiency was applied in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was conducted a summary analysis of messages undesirable, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of running PROACTIVE study, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day after seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have a activation specific receptors (Peroxisome Proliferative Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral Glucoseverings in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazone versus Gliclacidal than Monotherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone with 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacidal).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled trial of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite the three-month optimisation phase with insulin, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continue only insulin; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine-Quotiator compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effects of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week evaluation of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and a rise of the HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as marginally, but clinically significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plastic glycerides and the free fatty acids and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo in Pioglitazone, a statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel was observed, whereas Metformin and Gliclacidal values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the shift triglycerides, but also improved the postdendial-denced triglyceride level, this also on the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy to either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After the oral application, Pioglitazone is readily absorbent, with the peak concentrations of unchanging Pioglitazon in plasma usually can be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the M-IV contribution is based on effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could not have relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacologically dynamic by digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibroam (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases and lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive spellular Pioglitazon in humans the marker was mainly found in fences (55%) and at a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolism is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centreations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the Mother's solids are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administration with plasma volume, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to treatment with pioglitazone reducing hyperinsulin-anemia and increased insulin resistance of breast cancers, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates to reduce growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long term studies (up to 2 years), hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urine epithelium epithelium induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">The treatment with two other Thiacolidindionen (FAP) resulted in the treatment with two other Thiazolidindigenes to an elevated frequency of Kolontumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclacidal were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine-Quotiator compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postdendial-denced triglyceride level, this both via a effect on the Tryglycerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, stroke, akutem coronarisation, leg amputation above the ankle, koronarer Revascularisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results are close to the intake of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white as whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages undesirable, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon and were treated with over 7,400 patients who received comparative medication, increased incidence of bone breaks in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with pioglitazon treated patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was found in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not able to utilize insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks, concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin was measured in HbA1c) which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, which indicates that blood sugar levels were equally strongly lowered with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who are possibly exaggerated (allergic) on human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the cans of Actraphane might have to be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may have effect on blood sugar (the complete list is to be removed).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S approval for the office of Actraphane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day, if a fast-initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injections must be loaded under the skin at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar is significantly improved by an intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia warning system can be perceived and should be advised.</seg>
<seg id="874">Each change regarding strength, mark (manufacturers), insulin type (quick-acting, biphonic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (non-combinant DNA against insulin or insulin) can result in a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the shift to Actraphane is required, if the patient is required, it can be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after switching.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who have hypoglycaemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin have reported that the early warning of an hypoglycaemia affects less or less than in its previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go over several time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor, as such travels may be used to use insulin and meals to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore have to consider possible interactions in therapy and the patient will always ask for other drugs.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficient diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemia can lead to consciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or lasting disturbances of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Gelegaccidentally - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood glucose monitoring can be associated with complaints which are known as acute pain neuropathy and normally are reversible.</seg>

<seg id="886">A hypoglycemia can however develop infinitely variable: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated through oral inhalation of glucose or glucose foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have Traubenches, sweets, biscuits, or glucose fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemia with consciousness are treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg), by a proven auxiliary or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum capacity is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire actual duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The primary indeer of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplantation was suspended from one year (by example, how often a renewed organ transplant or a recovery of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and examined, as Advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Programmer.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunossuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should be done this drug or add changes in immunosusive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplantation or an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or transitional suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same taco-formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of formulation or the regimes should only be performed under the close control of one in the transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of the Tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The Advance of Advagraf should be based on clinical assessment of abortion and tolerability in regard to blood-level regulations (see below "recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf on Advagraf you should check the Tacrolimus Talspiegel in front of the changeover and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposure, measured as the valley level, was comparable to both types of kidney disease as well as in transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus tales are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate aftertransplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, can take an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf on Advagraf is a graft receive twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf. this changeover in relation to a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose, to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a change from other immunossomedsiva on Advagraf once a day must begin treatment with each in kidney and liver transplant recommended oral dosage for the prophylaxis of transplantation.</seg>

<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipient Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pankreas- and maltransplanted patients in an oral initiation of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, with breast cancers in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initiation dose of 0,3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosisizations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the maintenance of bleeding in the targeted area can be needed in patients with severe liver dysfunctions as a replacement of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tactics, it can be assumed that a dose of dose is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of serum) is recommended to calculate the creation of the creation and monitoring of the urine volume).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf with the changeover of a cicloso-based therapy is caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level mirror in whole blood. the dose should be based on clinical assessment of repulating and tolerability in case of using full-blood-blood-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent controls of the Tacrolimus tales during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-effects of Tacrolimus should also change after conversion from Programe to Advagraf, Dosisizung, modifications of immunosusive therapy or while simultaneous use of substances that could change the tackling blood circulation (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicinal product with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State is entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies have to conclude that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels do not exceed the blood levels in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, tacular mirror in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">In general, blood concentrations in the range of liver, kidney and cardiac patients were usually used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft reactions or other side effects, which can appear in a row of Tacrolimus Sub- or Exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same taco-formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of formulation or regimes should only be performed under the close control of one in the transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of transplantation with adult heart transplant and gradients in child age there are not any clinical data for the retardant wording Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which can lead to a lowering of the tacular mirror in the blood and a decrease of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements (hypericum perforatum) is included, or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacular concentrations in the blood is provided, as the tacular blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases it was known as cardiomyopathy called chamber-hypertrophie, which therefore can be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, liquid exposure and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Like with other immune soup, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to adequate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take the Tactics, symptoms for preaches like headache, change consciousness, seizures and vision should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Because Advagraf is hard capsules, lactose, lactose, is very careful in patients with the rare hereditary Galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency, or glucose-gactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products which are known as Hemmer or Inductors from CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore reduce blood values of tacular limus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the tacular blood levels at the same age of substances that can change CYP3A's metabolism and provide the tacular dose to maintain the same concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was developed with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluorconazole, Itraconazole and pre-iconazole and with the Macroid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV proteasceases (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the rise of blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, due to inhibiting gastrointestinal distortion.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosized prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute abortion actions, can increase the concentration of tackling blood in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacular drugs with medicines which can be metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus lowered the Clearance of steroid contracephalic and thus increase the hormone exposition, is particularly careful in decisions about receiving contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacular limus can decrease the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and can extend their half-time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of investigations on transplant patients provide no indication that, among the taco climate compared to other immunosusiva, increased risk for undesirable events relating to the course and the result of the pregnancy is.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins can be assumed that tactile is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacologically dynamic effects on molecular level should be conveyed to the effects of Tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosoleic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances are used to treat bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (one through the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood clots).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application is to be applied, if Advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing bleeding problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles, or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but according to a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the human odine factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is produced in another in the European Union called Recombinate, similar, but is different, so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding, as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"" "in the main study, the efficacy of Advate was awarded with" "" "excellent" "" "and" "" "well" "" "in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510." ""</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against the human odor factor VIII, Mausoleum or hamster protein or other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to grant approval for the transport of Advances in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are based on the severity of factor VIII-Mangel, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity cannot sink the same period under the given plasma seal (in% of the standard or in fact / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, the dose and frequency of injections have an adequate determination of factor VIII-plasmasculate.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and feature different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40, i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmais cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not governed with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration is to be judged by the patient, whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known compensation for the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk within the first 20 Exposition days most of the largest and genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 extrusion and anamnestic inhibitors was observed, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the resale of (lowest trianges) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs associated with ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), which have been treated with previously untreated patients who have increased higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease of blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood coagulation was calculated during all the time and both the factor VIII- mirror in plasma and the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a lasting severe to moderate-severe hemophilia A (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a patient to 26 conditions with ADVATE an low incenbitortiter (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 papal patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with a severe chronic hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) was determined by previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of a running clinical study showed 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins were analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti-Cho cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicate an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were isolated from the appearance of Urtica, Pruritus, rash and increased numbers of eosinophilic Granuloocytes in several repeated product positions in the context of the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data processing available since the initial approval data, the CHMP has further evaluated the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but in considered that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP is based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates an application of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder will apply to another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Humanistic Shushagent (CHMP), that the company returns its application for approval by Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the crossover (tissues, the other structures in the body connects, surrounds and relies on) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In doing so, it is a type of virus that has genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which means that it cannot produce copies of itself, and therefore no infections can trigger for humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could be injected directly into the tumors and allow cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 gene, which is made from the non-defect in the human body existing p53 gene, is normally used to restore damage DNA and kill the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer area in the field of substructure, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP had reviewed the answers of the company based on him, some questions were still unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the assessment of initially submitted documentation, the CHMP has created 120 a list of questions that is sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been sufficient that injection by Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors have advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not adequately proved that Advantin can be produced in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in touch with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP in knowledge whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"altered drug release" means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal ulceress swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may cause the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main factors were the changes in the severity of the hypocrisp symptoms that were reported from the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal and rated with a standard skala, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported the patients that Aerinaze had revenues, compared with a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients receiving Pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose is viewed, the patients under Aerinoco showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to the patients who have desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients), mouthiness, dizziness, psychomotor (lack of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleepless), somnolency (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinensis may not be applied to patients who may not be hypersensitive to desloratadine, Pseudoephedrine, or one of the other components, against adrenerge active ingredients or Loratadine (another drug for treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must not be applied to patients who suffer from a bottling angle glaucoma (hypertension), heart disease or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyrooosis (hyperpressure), hyperthyroodeficiency (hypertension), or a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a cerebral hemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe company a approval for the transport of Aeriners in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is in all the amount of swallow (i.e., without broken down, break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to failure and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after dissound the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is advised to limit the application time to 10 days, since when long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take off with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as broocritin, pergoose, Lisuride, hihydroergotamine or other deonattiva, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxytazolin, Napholin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data were not sufficient to pronounce respective recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinoco were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to pronounce respective recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment with the occurrence of hypertonic or a tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache, amplification) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, patient suffering is advised to be careful: • patients suffering from cancer patients with cardiovascular disease • patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospels in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze has at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically important interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences were detected between the desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo perceived regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin was not identified yet, so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is uninhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unthinkability of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, have no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to the prevalence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies in animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstriktorque properties of Pseudoephedrine should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may come to a drowsiness, that can lead to impairment of persistence or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased intellectual attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collation) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions).</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, tightening, weakness, weakness, excitation, breathinsufficiency, heart rhythms, palpitations, thirst, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision, hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropin typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupillary and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of expression of the adhesion molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose-study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplification, subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause any sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamantagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined using the total score for symptom (except nasal ulometry), significantly higher than a monotherapyephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in regard to the abnormative effect, determined using the nasal ulceress wellung, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinoco tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is demonstrable within 30 minutes following the administration of plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the weight-weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-doscopic study carried out with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects, has been found that four test subjects Desloratadin fainted out badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interact study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of Pseudoephedrine was the exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety, security macology, for toxicity in repeatability, for genotoxicity and reproductive-productive data with desloratadin, however, do not recognize any special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and a rabbit at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing, that histamine, a body's own substance, can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets linens symptoms occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as niotic, running or juckling nose and soaring eyes at the same time constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or sirens.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by adjusting the alteration of symptoms (itching, number and size of taddles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies submitted to prove that the body weight the syrup, solution to intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius increased from 25 to 32%, compared with the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decline of symptoms after six weeks was compared with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe company an approval for the transport of Aerius in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in the use of desloratadin with teenagers from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 & 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out accordingly to the previous disease and can be terminated at the resound of the symptoms and resumed in their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">During the persistent allergic rhinitis (the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the same period of pouring.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials involving desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened at the same time consuming Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may come to lightest, that can lead to impairment of perplexity or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uraria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently used side effects, which was reported more frequently than placebo was fatigue (1,2%) and mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect headache, these were treated at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadin and treated at 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose-dose, up to 45 mg of desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibiting of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of expression of the adhesion molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical trial with multiple doses, in the desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, was given no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadin at a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninety of the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual dosing study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables, including amplification, subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis was Aerius effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as niotic, Nasensecretion and itching of the nose, itching, cadence and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as an alternative in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistible allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the questionnaire about the quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduced the burden of allergic rhinitis caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigating further forms of Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology disregards the etiology at the different forms of similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As the histamine release is a thoughtful factor in all ancient illness, it is expected that Desloratadin except during the chronic idiopathic uraria also leads to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective at the improvement of Pruritus and the lowering of size and number of Quaddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of itching over 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wax considerably, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In an pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients "Demographs" were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no obligation for a clinical relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine, however, was not identified yet, so interaction with other drugs did not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is uninhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with desloratadin at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty foods, calory rich breakfast) were not included in the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies carried out with desloratadin and Loratadin who exhibited in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding toxicity profile of desloratadin and from Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on security macology, toxicity in repeatability, genotoxicity, and reproductive parity leave the preclinical data with desloratadin no particular hazards for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colored film (contains Lactose-Monohydrat, Hypromess, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, indigocarmin (E 132)), colorless film (includes hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviation of symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The duplication doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that no data suggest that treatment of a infectious rhinitis containing Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory lessons or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis should play a role in diagnosis, physical studies and appropriate laboratory and skin studies.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic desloratadine is restricted and experienced a higher substanzee (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup for children between 2 and 11 years, which is restricted - is identical to the children that are normal metabolize.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with severe problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency did not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interaction were not found in clinical trials involving Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not reinforced with the effects of Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup Group like the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic uraria, were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study in adults and adolescents who were administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (Neunfold clinical dose), no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old came to question for an antihistamine therapy, received daily desloratadindosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>

<seg id="1928">The use of amperavir should take place under consideration of the individual viral resistors and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amperavir as a solution to intake is about 14% lower than of ambavir as capsule; therefore, aspirase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aspirase capsules is 600 mg ambavir twice daily with 100 mg of kjavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kjavir (Boosterling), higher doses must be applied to asticase (1200 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aspirase capsules is 20 mg of ambabor / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg ambavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asticase in combination with low doses of kjavir or other proteasceases were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Itase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to failure to inconceivable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, an adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aventase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, curkraut (hypericum perforatum) may contain, may not be used due to the risk of reducing plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of ambavir during ingestion of ambavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Aventase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with ampervase does not prevent the risk of HIV to other sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, aspirase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of kjavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk for heavy liver problems with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an simultaneous antiviral treatment of Hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant technical information for this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver operation under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Aventase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucoyorrhoids, which are changed via CYP3A4, is not recommended that the possible use of treatment of the risk of systemic corticooiesis effects including Morbus Cushing and suppression of the adniotic function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors of CYP3A4 is dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of myoplazatin and Simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International normalised ratio), are methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, ampervase can be less effective because of ambillings (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amperavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contracephalitis can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to be able to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on opium pulchment symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kjavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity, due to the high propylation content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aperture should be set to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received a antiretroviral therapy, including proteasceinhibitors, was reported on the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exhalation of existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial tiology is assumed (including the application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuression, higher body mass index), were reported cases of osteoekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with small therapeutic width of the drug may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with small therapeutic width of kcaviar may not be combined with drugs whose substances are primarily associated with CYP2D6, and are connected to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance class.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to eliminate the humility of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of ambavir can be humbled by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with curkraut (hypericum perforatum).</seg>

<seg id="1965">A dose of dose for one of the drug is not necessary when Nelfinavir is administered together with ambavir (see also vanity below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, if Cmax is decreased by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) in combination with ambavir capsules (600 mg twice a day) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg ambavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and insistence of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">If Amendavir (750 mg twice a day) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kjavir twice a day) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of ambavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day at the combination of ambavir (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg caviar cavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when ambavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kjavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended not to be engmaschige monitoring since the effectiveness and unquestionable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study in combination with didanosin combination with didanosin, but is recommended due to the antacid component of didanosin, however, that the revenue of didanosin and asticase are at least one hour apart (see antacid below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination of Estrar in combination with ambavir (600 mg twice daily) and kettavir (100 mg twice a day) no dose to be required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Estrar in combination with ambabound and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protein inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine to other proteasceinhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may possibly lowers the serum concentration of Ambavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used at the same time, caution is advisable, since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this drug is used together, caution is offered; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be made, since an exact forecast of the effect of the combination of ambabor and kjavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ambabound and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmaconzentration (AUC) by Rifabutin caused by 193% and thus a rise of adverse events related to Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required to abstained together with ambigutin, at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Aventase in combination with erythromycin was not performed, but could be increased the plasma seal of both medicines in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of 700 mg of fossil-avir and 100 mg of ketoconazole daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-m) to 2,69m once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with kettonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, Hemmer or Inductors from CYP3A4, can be used if they are applied to interactions, possibly interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asticasis.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasceases it is advisable that antacids can not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can result in resortive disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulva which are known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amperavir can lead to a humiliation of amperavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentration of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, codipin, and dipin pin, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine, nimodipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by ambavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake of asticase can considerably increase the plasmaconzentorations and enhance the side effects of PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) was significantly increased when endogenous cortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenera with kjavir is not recommended, unless the possible use of treatment of treatment of systemic corticooiosis (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which is dependent on CYP3A4, are distinctive increases of the plasma seal at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma welding increases these HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors to myopathy including a rhudomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of the mirrors, since plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacular limus can be increased by ambavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Thus, ampervase may not be applied along with oral mdazolam (see section 4.3) while the respiratory application is provided with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteasrotors indicate a possible rise in the plasma seal of Midazolam around the 3- up to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with ambabor, patients should therefore be monitored on opium pulchment symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kjavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical compares, no recommendation can be given, as Amendavir is administered simultaneously with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same time of warfarin or other oral anticoagulances together with the respiratory system, an increased control of the INR (International normalised ratio) is recommended for the possibility of reducing or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contracephalitis is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramin and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time of respiratory treatment (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used for the mother's possible use during pregnancy in pregnancy by means of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, ambabound related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambabor survived in people into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the nibation in the uterus until the end of the stagnation of Ambabor, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of demand, including Fertility and Reproductive capability, was not impaired by the administration of Ambavir on the parent.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The unthinkability of Aventase has been studied in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Auniase treatment were mild to moderately pronounced, occurred early and led rarely to the treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in relation to the treatment of Aventase or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the grasshopper.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned adverse events are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with proteasceases were not treated twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), who were listed below the examination as in connection with the study drug, were listed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as the treatment-saving laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fawn fat tissue, proliferate fat tissue, hypertrophie of the breasts and dorsoal fat accumulation (Stierners).</seg>
<seg id="2009">At 113 antiretroviral do not pre-treated persons who had been treated with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stierners) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study, PROAB 3006 was found at 245 NRTIER in pre-treated patients (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with different NRTIs over a median duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash were usually mild to moderately pronounced, erythema or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoekrose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disorder or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an anti-inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Aware twice a day along with low dosized kjavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which received under sole aspirase treatment; an exception of the triglyceride and CPK values, which received Aventase together with low dosized kjavir, were very frequent.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is observed at signs of a toxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thereby preventing the process of viral gag- and Gag-pol- Polyproteins in sequence with a result of education unmature, not infecologically virus.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both at acute and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amperavir is found in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,41 µm at chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between activity of amperavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibiting of HIV-1 replication in human being is not defined yet.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with the currently registered Fosamprenavir / konavir doses have been observed - as with other kcaviar treatment schemas with proteasrotors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure could be studied until week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, with which a virological failure within the 59 included, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those with adult.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg), treated patients with protein inhibitors were treated with virologically failure over 96 weeks, the following proteinhibitors mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical resistance-based analyses of Genotypical interpretations can be used for evaluation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / kettavir in patients with protein-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / konavir defined resistence as the presence of mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I / C / W / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a reduced phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir as well as a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is advised to attract current interaction systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">On phenotypic resistance-tested analyses of clinically validated phoning systems may be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of ambavir / kjavir or Fosamprenavir / konavir in patients with protein inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Firms which distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four counts with a reduced sensitivity to Ambavir associated patterns creates a certain crusement against kjavir, sensitivity to indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir but generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistance between Amendavir and other proteasureters for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistor, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients (one of which, a resistance against Lopinavir and Saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / kjavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / kjavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / kjavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / kjavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / kjavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa Ambabor retains its activity against some other proteasceinhibitors of isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a reconciling therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits, which may affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the effectiveness of Aventase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial (600 mg twice a day) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest kettonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Aventase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-sub balance of APV / konavir as opposed to the SoC-PI group with regard to the time-adjusted average change from the output value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underflow wave of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the effectiveness of indeboostered Aventase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, 152 with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was administered three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosizavir was given at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated children who are expected to be considered "unbleooed" Aventase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing the average duration (max) to the maximum serum concentration of ambabor is approximately 1 to 2 hours for one capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, if Cmax is lowered by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was administered together with ambavir (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ambavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake although the simultaneous food intake affects the magnitude and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg on a body weight of 70 kg) and allows to close a large distribution volume, as well as an enormous penetration of ambabor from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in total concentration of the substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound Ambavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration remains constant, the percentage of free active stockings remained constant throughout the course of the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore we need to induce the CYP3A4 inductive or inhibit the CYP3A4 substrate, with caution when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of respiratory capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Ambabor exposure, as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is from solution 14% less biodegradable than from capsules; therefore, aspirase solution and respiratory capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the impact of renal dysfunctional disorders is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to ambavir plasma welding, similar to those who are obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg ambavir twice a day without simultaneous administration of kjavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amperavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benigne hepatcellular Adenome at dosages caused by 2.0 times (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to man, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatcellular adenoma and carcinomas has not been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for humans are unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the relevant exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, little clues for the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests, micro-core test in rats and chromosome aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambabor neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity may be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during administration of the treatment still after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals, which were treated with an age of 4 days, showed high mortality in the controls as well as with ambavir animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasmaexposition, significantly lower (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dose at humans, however, a number of small changes including thymus tonation and marginally skeletal changes were observed in a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asticase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kjavir (Boosterling), higher doses must be applied to asticase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for aspirase capsules is 20 mg of ambabor / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily highest dose of 2400 mg ambavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with weak or lighter liver function with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under surveillance of the International normalised ratio), are methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aperture should be set to 27 times when an rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk for a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti-retroviral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trials for children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimiodine could not be shown in these studies at the examined dosages (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose has been observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentration in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were measured in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bag).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life period was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod had low effect on MC-diagnosed skin of patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or super-cellist basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the paint toxicity in the rat no. 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; one also carried out for four months on the paint applique has no similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice during oral administration at three days a week induced no tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk of people due to systematic exposure is very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors were treated in mice, treated with the effective free cream, previously and in greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, it was also measured its effectiveness (by increasing its effect in terms of reduction in the urine concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the Gag concentrations in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat treatment, fever and reactions to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied to patients who are highly sensitive to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will be updated every year any new information that may be known, and if this summary is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is receiving patients receiving Althazyme, regarding reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. as approval to the office of Aldurazyme in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-Mammalogy-cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Muesysaccharisocket I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased when the patient wears up to a maximum dose of 43 e / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any correlation between infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also be monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are now available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 trial, almost all patients with IgG antibodies to Laronidase constitute, usually within 3 months of treatment start.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, risks must be cautious due to a hypersensitivity reaction due to the theoretical risk reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipylock) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or medium-severe infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be scaled and / or reducing the infusion rate for half of the infusion rate which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is to be weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate which occurred the previous reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme shouldn't be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular recording of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is exposed to newborns that were exposed to Laronidase about the breast milk, it is recommended to not breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects of clinical trials were classified as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which have been observed during the phase 3 study and extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years, frequently (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement in the upper respiratory tract and lungs were beyond heavy reactions, including bronchase asmus, breathing and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug-effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe contamination and treatment duration of up to 12 months have been reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a serum version, whereas in the patients at the age of 5 years with a severe contamination form (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to an early departure from the study) were observed in 13 / 45 patients with radioimmunopreparation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients who never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients suffering from low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in gag mirror in the harn, whereas in patients with high antibody detection, a variable reduction of gag was observed in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to small neutralizing effect on the enzymatic laronials activity in vitro that appeared not to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undesired medicine reactions, although the occurrence of adverse reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzymes of the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats and preventing a further accumulation of encycloectivity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via manose-6 phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of the patients had been recruited from the mean phenotype, and only one patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had a trained expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week for another 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients were treated with Aldurazyme treated with the placebo group to improve the lung function and the ability to see in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improved and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme Group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The acceptance of the expected procentual FEV is clinically significant over this period, and the absolute pulmonary volume increased further proportional to body size growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with hepnuclear treatment in the treatment of 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease in the Gag mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease of disease between the patients receiving a combined final variable (expected normal FEV, range in 6-minute walk, range of shoulder-joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with middle circulation).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- mirror.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z score for this age group. the younger patients with severe contamination form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean patients with severe contamination form were limited, limited, or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were carried out to pharmacologically dynamic effects of different Aldurazyme Dosization schemata to the gag mirror in the harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be patient who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a justifiable alternative; however, is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent to.</seg>

<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive intramuscular injection vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first Pemetrexed dose as well as in any third upgrade cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received pemetrexed, a complete blood sample should be created prior to each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte tale.</seg>

<seg id="2381">Following the recovery, patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapies or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient treatment before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients to 2 can cure or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematology Toxicity 3 or 4 or so on during the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above, compared to patients at the age of 65, an increased by-effect is increased.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on the unthinkable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a Creatinine Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min does not need any dose adjustments that go beyond the recommended Dosisizations for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a Creatinine Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (near liver metastasis) are not specifically investigated in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the bone marker and Pemetrexed could not be administered to patients, before their absolute neutrophilation count increased again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte count once again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutropaid numbers, thrombocyte and maximum non-hematology toxicity, as they were observed in previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 of hematological and nonwoven toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutrropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutrropenia was observed if a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients have to rely on to use Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous activation of non-steroid antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, treatment and mindes- after 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, intended for therapy with pupil remixed, must avoid the intake of NSAIDs with a long half-time value for at least 5 days before the therapy, treatment and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred, corresponding risk factors for the onset of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, patients with clinically significant fluid-accumulation in transcellular space is required a drainage of the effusion in front of the treatment of pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving pemetremixed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application of attenued live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible cranial of reproductive ability exists by pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn insisted on advice regarding sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroid anti-sterilistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) lead to a reduced Pemetrexed position with the result of a proliferating effect of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore beware if in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, treatment and mindes- had avoided 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the acquisition will be present with NSAIDs with a long seminal value, such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application of pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, treatment and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status as the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulances and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased surveillance frequency of INR (International normalised ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient ducks with oral anticoagulation.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed at pregnant women, but as with ande- antimetabolites are expected to be severe birth defects in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, unless necessarily, demanding and after careful defense of the farm for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich national meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be taken with an improved metabolic control, patients who consult a drug against diabetes, before the beginning of a therapy with alli to consult a doctor or pharmacist because the dose of antidiabetic must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients receiving alli as well as medicine for hypertension or an elevated Cholesterinspiegel, should ask their doctor or pharmacists if the dosing of this medicine needs to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on drug-effects of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and ciclosporin, a lowering of the ciclosporin plasma seal was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulances in combination with orlistat could be influenced by the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with orlistat, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, and beta-carotins in the standard range remained.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, to take the patient recommended, before bedtime a supplemental multivitamin was to be taken to ensure a sufficient vital intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single-one dose Amiodarone a limited number of healthy volunteers was observed at the same time orlistat, a small decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and implies with the pharmacological effects of the drug, since the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of people is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The prevalence of known side effects, which were detected after the market launch of orlistat, is not known as these events were voluntarily reported from a population uncertained.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects depend on the mode of mode, and thereby arise, that increase fat from the body is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually appear within the first weeks after the start of treatment, as you might have reduced the fat content in diet perhaps not consistently reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the malnourished preferences: • Begin a few days, or better a week before the first taking of capsules with a fetching diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and over the size of the portions you usually take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the probability that you will exceed your fat limit. • Cut your recommended fat intake evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat that you can take per meal, not to get them in the form of a fat-rich main Court or of a restrained dessert, as you possibly have done with other programs for weight loss. • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control these with the time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Do not use medicines for children unaccessible. • Do not apply any more to the use of the expiration date. • The bottle contains two white-sealed containers with Silicagel, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin) as well as for chemotherapies (such as Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicinal product that can be used as an anti-medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended, since the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy treatment, which are strong respecting nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients with aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients with oneletron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy treatment, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi were treated in the 24 hours after chemotherapy had no vomiting (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients with oneletron treated patients (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted an approval to the company, Helsinki, Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an approval for the office of Aloxi in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxi on prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding one before the Corticosteroids chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can lengthen the colon stream, patients with anamnestibation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is enjoined by using Palonosetron with medicines containing the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or tend towards such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In the connection with a further chemical therapeutics gift, aloxi is not used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron does not prevent the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, dosxorubici and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacological interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady equivalor concentration of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacokinetic analysis it has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecetidin, Ranitidin, Cimetidin, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience to the application of Palonosetron at Human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered to be treated by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in clinical trials (a total of 633 patients) observed at least possibly with aloxi related cases, headache (9%) and fruit pation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of survival reactions and reactions at the appointment (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar skins can be seen from adverse events such as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of reactive relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective treatment at a aloxide overdozation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 500mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-time 7.3 hours) received treatment to day 1 without dexamethase.intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron received patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapychemotherapy was summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical trials, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block an ion channels at ventricular De- and repolarization, and extend the duration of the shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study of 221 healthy volunteers were evaluated in the evaluation of the EKG-effects of I.V. dosing Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma centration an slow elimination from the body with an average terminology of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma percentage (Cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally generally in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 m / kg in patients and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After an intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses of 3 doses of patients ranged from day 1 to day 5 measured (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma centration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposition (AUC0- ∞) comparable to one intravenous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after one-time of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys, and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolism, which are compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 (CYP1A2) are involved in the metabolism of the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were recovered about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unchanging drug made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolusinjektion, the total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function cases the terminale Eliminationshal endage and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, only following expositions were observed, which are considered sufficient to determine the maximum of human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical trials showed that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular rate and repolarization, and can extend the swap rate.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose) spoke in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a proliferative frequency of liver tumor, endocrine, pancreas, adnierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and because aloxi is determined for one-time application, relevance of these results is minimal.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) adopted a negative report on the approval of the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was supposed to be a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same veteran ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Substances").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic hepatitis C (a viral infection) hepatitis C (a viral infection).</seg>

<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data which prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition, and purity of medication, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference case by 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients were treated according to 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been told that data on stability of the drug and the market-market drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease increases more patients with more patients than the reference case; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, in the study, the test was prompted to investigate the question, to what extent the medication is a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a narrative formation incoming skin infection) and small infected military junctions (Riss- or cutting), inclination and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which were detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because alarm against this kind of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the surface area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient is not addressing the treatment for two or three days, the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blocking of bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indices of the efficacy was in all five studies of the patients whose infection was delayed after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients suffering from Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-dogs Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates were considered: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of the patients of both groups were treated for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is caused by the treatment of excavation (eiterfilled hollow areas in body tissue) or of infections, which have been caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanistic Cracker (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo on short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections are concealed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lazations, bruising or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">The European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the office of Altargo in the whole European Union in May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement appear within two to three days should still be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the Salbe carefully wigout and an adequate alternative therapy of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical studies in secondary infected wounds was the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections, caused by a methicillin forhylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place will occur.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effects of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved when people after topical use were achieved on the poor skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinical-relevant inhibition is not expected in vivo (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous gift of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the minor systemic exposure to topical application in patients, Dosisizations are not used for treatment, when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproductive medicine after oral taking and are inadequate in relation to a statement about the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin of the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding continued / ends or terminate the therapy with Altargo is continued, it is to take place between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo, was the most often reported by exposure of irritation at the passage that about 1% of the patients entered.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Reapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckanus (formerly Pleurotus passeckanus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosomes which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding of ribosomales protein L3 is involved in the ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferring centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through binding on this binding point Pleuromutiline block the peptide, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomers.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infectious forms, a consultation by experts should be targeted.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to be considered in the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was brought up daily under occlusion on intact and intillated skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 of adult patients each before the median and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic treatment in person according to topical application of 1% obe on 200 cm2 of the desired skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism - in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, using the CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 CYP2D6 CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) that were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-micrograph test to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There wasn't any male enhancement of reduced fertility associated with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which allows for up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2) of the desired skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study at rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the office must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system is present in the module 1.8.1 (Version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and as long as the market is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval for the office is obliged to implement further detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities as they were accepted in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and are described in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates by RMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP, Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use, "the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms on the treated spot, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other anointing, creams or lotions on the surface, which is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, on the mouth, or on the lips, in the nose, or in the female genital region.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment may be seen on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor about advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After giving the ointment you can cover the affected area with an sterilen association or a gazes, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag that contains 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient is used as part of a two doses of the vaccine, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, the ambient temperature may only be used, if the immune system is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, which can be taken out of two doses of an inocitinerary.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refractive dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have effect by turning the immune system (the body's natural defense of the body), "how to defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix also contains the same components, as the previously approved vaccine Twinrix adults and the vaccine ever approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given as part of a three doses of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are contained identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indices for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month period and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambian resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degrees of the protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injector, redness, pness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who are possibly exaggerated (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. an approval for the office of the office of Ambirix in the entire country</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunzation with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is to be given at the date of choice and the second dose for six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a summons can be vaccinated both for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B, may be vaccinated with the corresponding monovarian vaccines or combination of hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies observed in the same size as according to vaccination with the respective monovarian vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunity people who have addressed to a hepatitis B vaccine that may require a shortfall of protection because they may also be protected by immunological memory through the immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 How with all injection systems should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate opportunities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard vaccine is recommended to contain 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of haemalysis patients and persons with disturbances of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody is reached, so in these cases the gift of other inoccurrences can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intraocular injection or intramuscular administration may result in the gluteal muscles to a suboptimal pulse success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At thrombocytopenie or blood coagulation disorders, Ambirix can be injected as an exception as it can occur following intramuscular administration to bleeding in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time, Tetanus-, azellular Pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis, and Haemophilus influenza, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunoskeletal therapy or patients with immune defect must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturing, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever similar with the incidence that was observed with the previous Thiomersale- and preservative-containing vaccines formulating.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered at a total of 1027 vaccinations in the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matures at a calculation base per vaccination dose ambient ambient, but not at a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the Gift of Ambirix at 57% of subjects compared to 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccine cycle 66.4% of the subjects were given to the Ambirix, over 63.8% of the subjects who had vaccinated with the 3-dose of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Matcha was comparable high (i.e., above all the vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects, the Ambirix were compared to 36.2% of the subjects who received the 3-doses combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and painfulness was small and comparable to the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination of 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study of 1- and 11-year-old vaccination records, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11- year old vaccination with ambient is a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not reported per annotape.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines caused by severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccination schemas with a combination of 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically significant.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies that were carried out at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6 abused dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 abused dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out at 12- to including 15-year-old, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination pad with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Among the 289 persons, whose immunogeneity was compensated, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 to the gift of the 3 dose of dose. it was significantly higher than Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response shown in a clinical comparative study of 1- and 11-year-olds to terminate a month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccination received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be demonstrated at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient temperature in 0-6 months of inoculema.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction to both antigens was comparable to both antigens against both antigens, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies are comparable to 0-6 months of vaccinations similar to the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">At the same time, when the first dose of Ambirix was administered simultaneously with a combination of a combined Diphtherie-, tetanus-, azellular Pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults, showed similar seroprotection and serum levels as for previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is available either as a result of the reset to any external particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all the vaccines, Ambirix can not protect completely from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child before the administration of both vaccinations are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (though you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or feel sick / feel) a vaccination may not prevent any disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections, which are toxic or symptoms, which are similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Allergic reaction can cause irritating skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue. • If with you / your child has occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to prevent a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the use of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">If there is a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccine, the physician will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine by a reduced content of hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components will usually be given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected with serious blood clots, injected under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / his body's defense, or if you / your child are undergoing a hemline analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can be inadequate, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Make your doctor if you / your child will take another medicine (including those who can have been vaccinated without wear) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / was administered or immorlobulins (antibodies), or if you have been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated at separate places and as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will be enough.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs with 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since the issuance of the first approval for the office, the CHMP declare that the benefit of the benefit ratio is positive for Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, it was only limited to a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain injury due to high ammonia concentrations).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with the food or over a gastroastomieschi (through the stomach-blanket in the gastrointestinal tube) or an nasal probe (through the nose in the gastrointestinal tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonia did not be compared to any treatment or with placebo (an anti-drug medicine, i.e., without the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also contribute to loss of loss, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, liquid form, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In the end, the Committee on Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonia is effective in patients with disturbances of the urea-cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was approved under "extraordinary circumstances," due to the rarity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-proof form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifested after the first life of life) there is an indication of the use when angiogenesis is hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gorous disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granite.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by taking the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Patients who suffer from an early-proof lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0,4-0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with gorous disorders, as a risk for the emergence of estophagusulzera exists if the tablets are not immediately entering the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 grams (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with conquiver heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and oedetion in previous clinical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat is carried out on the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney insufficiency with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetic to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and to a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturity of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetic is eliminated during the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of the patients had at least an undesired event (AE), and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that it was not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed an metabolic rate in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">In a case of an overdose, an average single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) occurred with an accidental dose of 10 months.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosistive neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is an internationally active link which is conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine conjugated through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen oxide); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of meaning that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival opportunities and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infecting, and the disease resulted in treating peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their sticking-free analogy within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds (Sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to increase diagnosed disorders to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and were treated already before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with the time with many mental disabilities or other neurologic deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-proof form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the ornithintranny bamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonic encephalopathy, and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a diet reduced, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are already irreversible, and in some cases, further deterioration of neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetic, which is conjuked in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were tested according to a single dose of 5 grams sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and patients with liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also examined with cancer patients according to intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking the plasma-supply of phenylbutyrat was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycination or hemoglobster disorders (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning no phenylacetic in plasma was detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis (20 g / day oral in three single doses) were treated, the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentrations of the third day is five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is eliminated in 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated Phenylacetylglutamine by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules will be taken either oral (babies and children who do not swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing) or via a loastomieschke or an nasal sonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protesters in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">Patients who suffer from an early-proof lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranny bamylase is the substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 grams (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat orders were exposed to Phenylacetic (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), there came to lesions in the pyramids of the cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed an metabolic rate in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess liquid</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the evaluation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that each gram captured sodium phenylbutyrate between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are already irreversible, and in some cases, further deterioration of neurological condition occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in Granulatform 15 minutes after taking the plasma-supply of phenylbutyrat have been found.</seg>

<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be disbanded before use in water (the solubility of sodium phenylityrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot leave the sticky waste products, which cannot leave after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducted laboratory studies, you must notify the doctor to take AMMONAPS, as Sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the findings of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measured value for electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with Angina or heart attacks to help maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, where the effect of angiox in sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different drug for preventing blood clots) was compared to conventional combination treatment with heparine (another anticoagulans) and GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI was often a static (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter), and additionally they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or reascularization) after 30 days or a year, as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI was angiox in terms of all indicators as effective as Heparine, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be excessive (allergic) against bivalerudin, other miludine or other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be applied to patients who recently had bleeding, as well as for people with heavy blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">At the end the Committee on Humanitarian Relief (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Angiox is in the treatment of ACS and a PCI is a acceptable replacement for Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. an approval for the domestic policy of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">To treat adult patients with acute correlation of coronarsis (instabile angina / non-ST) upmarket infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) during an emergency treatment or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is performed in another sequence a PCI is given an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg and the infusion of the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI board, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If it is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes), a second bolt should be reduced to 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and administered the bolt dose rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts to over 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (if with Bivalan udin against ACS is treated or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt.</seg>

<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken to warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International normalised rates) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudin once again reached the existing level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of anticoagulances (Heparine, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocytic aggregation-) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, teenagers and children from six years with diabetes, which require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra subcutaneous subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected thighs or the upper arm injected with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin (sugar) in the blood or process insulin does not handle insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter working time has a short-effective humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, insulin does not work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indices for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance glycolic hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a decrease of 0.14% at insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% compared to normal normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are possibly exaggerated (allergic) against insulin lulin or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Apidra cans may need to be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can influence the blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to provide a approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the stomach ceiling, to apply or subcutaneous injections by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal decks.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the diminished glucose capacity and the diminished insulin variation, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in actual effect, the mark (her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can draw a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or demolition of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin any other manufacturer should be made under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of an hypoglycaemia is dependent on the reworking profile of the insulin profile and can therefore change when changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase the bloodshed activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, include oral antidiabetic, angiotetin, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxylic, salicyolates and sulphonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic olytics such as bed loosening, clonidine, guanethidin and reserves the symptoms of adrenergen resins are weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on Reproductive Toxicity showed no differences in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisses occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin occurs neither in breast milk, nor is absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical trials in accordance with the incidence of their occurrence (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the availability of the contents (not invalable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to change the injector within the stream of injections, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injector.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be treated with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluing lookin, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous gau- be removed from insulin lulisin the efficiencies, and the actual duration is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, isinglulisin therapeutically relevant dosing area of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional absorbing glucose effect, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a lower glucose increase in the glucose effect.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response effects like normal human insulin and achieves a full glucose effect for about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was obvious that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postdenal glycemic control is achieved, as with a normal normal insulin that is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before the meal, isinglulisiscated in 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved a better post-denial control than with the normal normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If isinglulisis turned in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as in human normal insulin is given (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at the age of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin that was 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal was given (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the onset of the meal compared to human norms, which was 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
